Iranian deal .\n\n\nFinding the perfect moment to forge a strategic agreement with Iran \n\nThe Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the People 's Republic of China , consisting of 20 articles and Chinese investment in Iran of $ 400 billion over 25 years , with $ 280 billion for the development of Iran 's petrochemical sectors and another $ 120 billion for the country 's transportation and manufacturing infrastructure , covers banking , commerce and services , transportation and railway , ports , energy , industry , and dozens of other projects .\n\n\nTo benefit from Chinese investment and infrastructure projects and confront U.S. domination in the world , Iran has rightly capitalized on China 's growing influence across South East Asia , Central Asia , the Middle East and Gulf Cooperation Council countries .\nA long term Chinese commitment i.e. , the Sino - Iranian deal , would help Tehran demand greater economic cooperation with Beijing .\n\n\nIran , which has a vision of non - alignment with the slogan of neither East nor West since the 1979 revolution toppling its pro - American monarch , is steadily turning towards Asia as part of its Look - East strategy .\nAs in 2019 , Iran , China , and Russia conducted a joint military exercise in the Gulf of Oman .\nMoreover , Iran requires both China and Russia , with veto power in UN Security Council , to neutralize U.S. hegemony , and to prevent any kind of sanctions by the United Nations - backed by the U.S.Furthermore , insatiable oil demand and military and civilian technology pushes Iran toward an alliance with the rising superpower .\n\n\nAn end to Iran 's non - alignment strategy \n\nThe Sino - Iranian deal , if enforced as planned , would more effectively end Iran 's non - alignment and incorporate Iran into the framework of Eurasia .\nThis strategic shift and incorporation into the area of Eurasia region indicate Iran has the capacity to find economic partners and energy consumers among major economies of the continent to quench its economic progress thirst .\n\n\nThe failure of Iran 's repeated attempts to improve economic links with the West as a prelude to improved political ties has been a major reason for Iran 's move towards China and other Asian countries , regarded locally as the \" pivot to the east \" .\n\n\nIran welcomed American and European companies into the country including many energy companies after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015 and offered to buy oil and gas .\nHowever , the response to Iranian offers by Western states under pressure from the U.S. was inhospitable .\nWashington was not interested in improving relations , but instead wanted regime change in Tehran and Iranian leadership soon smelled a rat .\n\n\nRecipe for ailing Iran economic burden ?\n\n\nTheinfusionofasignificantamountofcashintoitseconomy , especiallyits \n ( $ 280bn ) and manufacturing and transport infrastructure ( $ 120bn ) would be a recipe for Iran 's ailing economy and ease its economic burden .\nNo doubt it will create more jobs in the Islamic Republic of Iran and more industrial growth .\nIran 's deal with China is expected to relieve domestic opposition too .\nEconomic and political progress would boost the regional status of Iran and perhaps allow opponents to reduce tensions with Tehran .\nArab states might rush to make their own special deal with China .\n\n\nIran , which has much of the world 's oil reserves and is one of the top five producers of natural gas , had to face an economic shrinkage of around 10 percent , largely due to the reintroduction of US sanctions .\nBecause of the COVID-19 outbreak , Iran 's economy was hit hard with the lowest oil and gas output .\nOil output and revenues have plummeted   falling from nearly 4 million bpd in 2018 to just 2 million bpd nowadays , as per New York Times .\n\n\nThe supreme leader , a staunch advocate of making alliance with non -
