Banning porn site is not going to help. Pakistan hist more porn sites than many other countries where nothing is banned. PTA will continue to work like many other agencies of Pakistan. Every damn bad thing is sold in Pakistan including porn and it will continue. As far as the boy is concerned, I am not sure about the facts reported so far.

Once he's done with the list of 750,000 websites, maybe he can move on to compiling a list of unregistered Madrassa's to help the state regulate those too.

There are 525,600 minutes in a year. If we assume that he slept at least 8 hours a day (that's 175,200 minutes he wasn't porn hunting. Unless his friends took over while he slept.) That leaves 350,400 minutes in a year.

However, there are objections and some youths even vandalized the temporary fencing around the temple site. Clips of the attack and a person offering \u2018azan\u2019 went viral on social media.\n\nMufti Zia-ud-Din of the Lahore chapter of\n\nJamia Ashrafia, a leading cleric in Pakistan, has issued a fatwa against the construction of the temple\n\nby calling it \u201cun-Islamic.\u201d The fatwa, issued initially when the federal grant was approved, also states that according to Sharia laws, it is not permitted for non-Muslims to build their new worship places or rebuild those, which were in ruins as \u201cthis is a sin in an Islamic state.\u201d\n\nMinorities in Pakistan\n\nThe issue reflects the inner contradictions in Pakistan, an Islamic Republic. Of the estimated 221 million Pakistani citizens, over 96 percent are Muslim and around 1.85 percent are Hindus \u2013 although the Pakistan Hindu Council claims the latter number to be much higher.\n\nPakistan has only pre-partition shrines for Hindu, Christian and Sikhs; some of these are historic and serve the country\u2019s dwindling minorities. According to the Evacuee Trust Property Board of the Government of Pakistan, there are approximately 1,300 temples in the country with only 30 considered currently functional.\n\nAccording to a recent report in The Express Tribune, \u201cover the years, temples have vanished from Pakistan\u2019s largest city (Karachi), their remnants both a reminder of the past and a foretelling of a bleaker future for the port city\u2019s Hindus\u201d.\n\nThe federal cabinet under Prime Minister Imran Khan cleared Rs. 100 million (\u00a3500,000 or $630,685) worth of state funding on June 27. Following this, the Minister for Religious Affairs, Noorul Haq Qadri, told the\n\nNational Assembly that there was \u201cno question\u201d about the temple, but about the ability of the government funding\n\n. The minister had himself sought the grant from the cabinet after meeting a delegation of Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) belonging to Hindu and Christian minorities, including Lal Chand Malhi, Dr. Ramesh Vankwani, Jai Prakash Ukrani, Shunila Ruth, and James Thomas.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court on July 8 rejected a bunch of petitions questioning the government\u2019s move from political, constitutional, religious, civic and administrative standpoints. The Ulema Council of Pakistan, a body of the Islamic clergy has approved of the government\u2019s decision.\n\nThe government told the court that the issue had been referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on whether Muslim taxpayer\u2019s money can be used, for construction of the temple. CII Chairman Qibla Ayaz has acknowledged the receipt of the ministry\u2019s letter and he forwarded it to the council\u2019s research department to formulate an opinion. CII is a statutory body and the construction of the temple can only begin if the CII gives a favorable decision.\n\nClearly, the government\u2019s decision has been praised by some while some radical religious groups spoke against it. Some even threatened to kill the Hindus. Those in support point out that the taxpayers\u2019 money would be used and they include members of religious minorities as well.\n\nPakistan\u2019s political right and the Islamists say a\n\nshrine for a religious minority in the Islamic Republic is against Islam\n\n. The Holy Quran and the Hadith is being quoted in support.\n\nImran Khan \u2013 a liberal?\n\nPrime Minister Khan is considered personally a liberal, but his politics have been deeply conservative. He had supported the Taliban while in the opposition. However, projecting Pakistan as \u201ca symbol of hope and tolerance, away from its violent sectarian past\u201d has been part of the election promise that he made in the 2018 elections.\u00a0 He had also promised to improve conditions for Pakistan\u2019s religious minorities.\n\nWhile conditions in the ground have remained largely unchanged, Pakistan under Khan has played to the Western gallery by curbing militants like Hafiz Saeed, who heads the proscribed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and ensured freedom for Asia Bibi, a Christian woman convicted and jailed for long years on the charge of blasphemy.\n\nThe government\u2019s move on the temple, some media commentators suggest, is to show Pakistan in a better light in comparison with India, which is seen as being driven by Hindutva forces that are against India\u2019s religious minorities. In The Express Tribune (July 13, 2020), columnist Umair Zafar Malik states: \u201cThe very foundations of Pakistan lay in the desire of a religious minority to escape persecution and create a homeland where they would not face social, political or economic discrimination.\u201d\n\nOpposition Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) of the three-time premier Nawaz Sharif has supported the government\u2019s temple move. However, the political right has echoed criticisms like that of the religious right. The Speaker of the Punjab Assembly along with other political leaders has voiced strong contestations against the construction stating that it is against Islam and an insult to the Islamic kingdom.\n\nIn Dawn (July 10, 2020), political worker, writer, and teacher,\n\nAasim Sajjad Akhtar, criticized those who are opposing the temple project.\n\n\u201cThe temple may eventually be built, but the hateful and threatening polemic which comes to the fore around such issues is endemic. Hateful polemic is, in fact, just the tip of the iceberg; in both the past and present, churches have been burned down, Hindu and Christian girls and women forcibly converted and married off, unnamed and unseen thousands suffered lynching and targeted killings\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026the temple episode is also instructive because it provides both insight into the deep penetration of state ideology into society, segments of which now propagate religious supremacy as a matter of course, as well as the distinct material interests associated with places of religious worship.\u201d\n\nThe New Arab (July 10, 2020) quoted the Amnesty International: \u201cHalting the construction of a Hindu temple in Islamabad is an unconscionable act of bigotry that must be reversed immediately. Everyone has a right to freedom of religion or belief, a right that is guaranteed in Pakistan\u2019s constitution and its international obligations.\u201d \u2013\n\nSouth Asia Monitor\n\nComments\n\ncomments\n\nRelated Articles\n\nScroll Back To Top\n\nCaste, a racial slur against Hindus\n\n0\n\nPolitical versus faith-based colonizers\n\n0\n\nCAIR, ISNA affecting Hindu American rights in US\n\n0\n\nPolls\n\nWill the Moderna vaccine get US approval by year end?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nView Results\n\nLoading ...\n\nPolls Archive\n\nE-paper Latest Edition\n\nADVERTISEMENT \u2013 ASIABET 2020\n\n50 SPIRITUAL APPETIZERS \u2013 VINOD DHAWAN\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely book.

A long term Chinese commitment i.e., the Sino-Iranian deal, would help Tehran demand greater economic cooperation with Beijing.\n\nIran, which has a vision of non-alignment with the slogan of neither East nor West since the 1979 revolution toppling its pro-American monarch, is steadily turning towards Asia as part of its Look-East strategy. As in 2019, Iran, China, and Russia conducted a joint military exercise in the Gulf of Oman. Moreover, Iran requires both China and Russia, with veto power in UN Security Council, to neutralize U.S. hegemony, and to prevent any kind of sanctions by the United Nations-backed by the U.S.Furthermore, insatiable oil demand and military and civilian technology pushes Iran toward an alliance with the rising superpower.\n\nAn end to Iran\u2019s non-alignment strategy\n\nThe Sino-Iranian deal, if enforced as planned, would more effectively end Iran\u2019s non-alignment and incorporate Iran into the framework of Eurasia. This strategic shift and incorporation into the area of Eurasia region indicate Iran has the capacity to find economic partners and energy consumers among major economies of the continent to quench its economic progress thirst.\n\nThe failure of Iran\u2019s repeated attempts to improve economic links with the West as a prelude to improved political ties has been a major reason for Iran\u2019s move towards China and other Asian countries, regarded locally as the \u201cpivot to the east\u201d.\n\nIran welcomed American and European companies into the country including many energy companies after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015 and offered to buy oil and gas. However, the response to Iranian offers by Western states under pressure from the U.S. was inhospitable. Washington was not interested in improving relations, but instead wanted regime change in Tehran and Iranian leadership soon smelled a rat.\n\nRead More:\n\nThe China-Iran deal: Not about business but strategic communication\n\nRecipe for ailing Iran economic burden?\n\nThe\u00a0infusion\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0significant\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0cash\u00a0into\u00a0its\u00a0economy,\u00a0especially\u00a0its\n\nenergy\u00a0sector\n\n($280bn) and manufacturing and transport infrastructure ($120bn) would be a recipe for Iran\u2019s ailing economy and ease its economic burden. No doubt it will create more jobs in the Islamic Republic of Iran and more industrial growth. Iran\u2019s deal with China is expected to relieve domestic opposition too. Economic and political progress would boost the regional status of Iran and perhaps allow opponents to reduce tensions with Tehran. Arab states might rush to make their own special deal with China.\n\nIran, which has much of the world\u2019s oil reserves and is one of the top five producers of natural gas, had to face an economic shrinkage of around 10 percent, largely due to the reintroduction of US sanctions. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Iran\u2019s economy was hit hard with the lowest oil and gas output. Oil output and revenues have plummeted \u2014 falling from nearly 4 million bpd in 2018 to just 2 million bpd nowadays, as per New York Times.\n\nThe supreme leader, a staunch advocate of making alliance with non-Western powers, sees this deal more reliable than Western power, i.e. the US or Europe. President Trump\u2019s decision to scrap the Iran nuclear deal (2015) further intensified public emotions. President Hassan Rouhani, who once wanted to open avenues with the West, also advocated greater cooperation with Asian economies like China, Japan, and South Korea. Following the futile effort to reopen Iran\u2019s economy to the West after the nuclear agreement, he now tries to negotiate a fair agreement with the only major world power whose economic weight can match that of the US or Europe.\n\nRead More:\n\nIran shuns Indian investment, turns to China\n\nStrategic alignment with an Asian superpower\n\nIran is in dire need of civil and military cooperation and voice on a global scale, which can only be achieved by aligning itself with a superpower with enormous investment potential in multidimensional sectors in the form of this Sino-Iranian deal.\n\nIn addition, Iran wishes to expand its sphere of influence in the Eurasian region by acquiring full membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. To this end, China, the founding member of the organization, is required to support it.\n\nSimilarly, the Sino-Iranian deal will help provide Iran with a bargaining chip with Europe and the US over easing sanction in the future as the West will divert its attention towards this holistic agreement. China\u2019s more pronounced interest in Iran should alert the US to review its past approach towards Tehran. It would also serve as a balancing factor in the normalization of relations between the West and Beijing, which due to Corona and trade war between them is at the lowest stage.\n\nBenefits for China from the Sino-Iranian deal\n\nBeijing, on the other hand, is a big winner and plays a longer game. At Iranian ports, it could enjoy preferential treatment and develop free trade zones around the country. It will also include discounts for Iranian oil. Iran is to provide regular and discounted supply of oil to China for 25 years. \u201dChina would also develop free-trade zones in Maku, in Northwestern Iran; in Abadan, where the Shatt al-Arab river flows into the Persian Gulf, and on the gulf island Qeshm,\u201d according to a NYT report.\n\nThis agreement promises to greatly enhance China\u2019s position not only in the Middle East, but also in Central Asia, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean sea. Through this route, Beijing would have a land route to Europe.\n\nProbably, China will have a large security footprint at two new ports expected to be established adjacent to the Strait of Hormuz, through which oil trade passes by 30 to 40 per cent. Oil supply to its market would be assured.\n\nIn addition, China\u2019s regional position would be strengthened by having a presence on Iranian land, ultimately undermining US strategic supremacy in the Gulf. This could also strengthen China\u2019s international position. Deepening ties with Iran is an outcome to safeguard its interests.\n\nThe very reason why the U.S. geopolitical supremacy over the world is preserved is the control of world\u2019s maritime routes in the world. Among nine key maritime channels, the Gulf of Hormuz significantly controls the major global outflow of fossil fuels. The Chinese presence would give stronghold on these waters through which much of the world\u2019s oil transits.\n\nThe US assistance to ASEAN countries to limit Beijing\u2019s scope and legitimacy on the South China Sea would be of no benefit but to give China more options to use. Similarly \u00a0it would be no use for the US to condemn the Hong Kong issue. Providing military and economic assistance to the South-Eastern partners to contain China and labeling violation of the navigation freedom provided under UNCLOS (Convention on the Law of Sea) would not weaken China\u2019s efforts for its territorial claims. China will certainly consider alternatives.\n\nRead More:\n\nIran says no reason to hide deal with China\n\nMore provisions of the Sino-Iranian Deal\n\nThe deal has a provision of China building infrastructure for 5G telecommunications network in Iran. It would provide an opportunity to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, a company that is facing US sanctions, to enter the Iranian market.\n\nIt\u00a0would\u00a0also\u00a0bolster\n\nChina\u2019s new digital currency e-RMB\n\nas a way to bypass American financial systems, and reduce the power of the dollar. It would benefit China, the world\u2019s most energy consumer. Furthermore, Iran could find a mechanism to sell its oil while evading US sanctions.\n\nIran having million barrels of oil and gas, now a burden on Iran\u2019s economy to finance oil storage, would ultimately benefit from this deal. If the Sino-Iranian deal was implemented, it would revive Iran\u2019s economy and consequently stabilise its politics. On the other hand, over the decades, China would have continual energy supply to materialize its vision of connecting the Eurasian region and challenge the world\u2019s US Unipolarity.\n\nYet in global affairs, nothing is everlasting. The US returning to the Iran\u2019s nuclear deal and lifting sanctions against Iran, and allowing European and American companies to deal with Tehran, may avert Iran\u2019s strategic partnership with China.\n\nMuhammad Irfan is a civil\n\nservant in Pakistan.\n\nHe has also been teaching international relations to CSS and PMS candidates.

iranian deal and its implications", "phrased_article": "\" the sino - iranian deal will help provide iran with a bargaining_chip with europe and the us over easing sanction in the future as the west will divert its attention_towards this holistic agreement . \"   post us 's economic_downturn and global isolation triggered by the coronavirus , beijing sensed american vulnerability and initiated the sino - iranian deal .   finding the perfect moment to forge a strategic agreement with iran   the comprehensive_strategic_partnership between the islamic_republic_of_iran and the people 's_republic_of_china , consisting of 20 articles and chinese investment in iran of $_400_billion over 25 years , with $_280 billion for the development of iran 's petrochemical sectors and another $_120_billion for the country 's transportation and manufacturing infrastructure , covers banking , commerce and services , transportation and railway , ports , energy , industry , and dozens of other projects .   to benefit from chinese investment and infrastructure_projects and confront u.s. domination in the world , iran has rightly capitalized on china 's growing_influence across south_east_asia , central_asia , the middle_east and gulf_cooperation_council countries . a long_term chinese commitment i.e. , the sino - iranian deal , would help tehran demand greater economic_cooperation with beijing .   iran , which has a vision of non - alignment with the slogan of neither east nor west since the 1979 revolution toppling its pro - american monarch , is steadily turning towards asia as part of its look - east strategy . as in 2019 , iran , china , and russia conducted a joint_military_exercise in the gulf_of_oman . moreover , iran requires both china and russia , with veto_power in un_security_council , to neutralize u.s. hegemony , and to prevent any_kind of sanctions by the united_nations - backed by the u.s.furthermore , insatiable oil_demand and military_and_civilian technology pushes iran toward an alliance with the rising superpower .   an end to iran 's non - alignment strategy   the sino - iranian deal , if enforced as planned , would more effectively end iran 's non - alignment and incorporate iran into the framework of eurasia . this strategic_shift and incorporation into the area of eurasia region indicate iran has the capacity to find economic partners and energy consumers among major_economies of the continent to quench its economic progress thirst .   the failure of iran 's repeated_attempts to improve economic links with the west as a prelude to improved political ties has been a major_reason for iran 's move towards china and other asian_countries , regarded locally as the \" pivot to the east \" .   iran welcomed american and european companies into the country including many energy companies after the nuclear_deal was signed in 2015 and offered to buy oil_and_gas . however , the response to iranian offers by western states under pressure from the u.s. was inhospitable . washington was not interested in improving_relations , but instead wanted regime_change in tehran and iranian leadership soon smelled a rat .   recipe for ailing iran economic burden ?   Theinfusionofasignificantamountofcashintoitseconomy , especiallyits   ( $ 280bn ) and manufacturing and transport infrastructure ( $ 120bn ) would be a recipe for iran 's ailing_economy and ease its economic burden . no_doubt it will create_more_jobs in the islamic_republic_of_iran and more industrial_growth . iran 's deal with china is expected to relieve domestic opposition too . economic and political progress would boost the regional status of iran and perhaps allow opponents to reduce_tensions with tehran . arab_states might rush to make their_own special deal with china .   iran , which has much of the world 's oil_reserves and is one of the top five producers of natural_gas , had to face an economic shrinkage of around 10 percent , largely due to the reintroduction of us sanctions . because of the covid-19 outbreak , iran 's economy was hit_hard with the lowest oil_and_gas output . oil_output and revenues have plummeted   falling from nearly_4_million bpd in 2018 to just 2 million_bpd nowadays , as per new_york_times .   the supreme_leader , a staunch advocate of making alliance with non - western_powers , sees this deal more reliable than western power , i.e. the us or europe . president_trump 's decision_to_scrap the iran_nuclear_deal ( 2015 ) further intensified public emotions . president_hassan_rouhani , who once wanted to open avenues with the west , also advocated greater cooperation with asian_economies like china , japan , and south_korea . following the futile effort to reopen iran 's economy to the west after the nuclear agreement , he now tries to negotiate a fair agreement with the only major world power whose economic weight can match that of the us or europe .   strategic alignment with an asian superpower   iran is in dire_need of civil and military cooperation and voice on a global_scale , which can_only_be_achieved by aligning itself with a superpower with enormous investment potential in multidimensional sectors in the form of this sino - iranian deal .   in addition , iran wishes to expand its sphere_of_influence in the eurasian region by acquiring full membership of the shanghai_cooperation_organization . to this end , china , the founding_member of the organization , is required to support it .   similarly , the sino - iranian deal will help provide iran with a bargaining_chip with europe and the us over easing sanction in the future as the west will divert its attention_towards this holistic agreement . china 's more pronounced interest in iran should alert the us to review its past approach_towards tehran . it would also serve as a balancing factor in the normalization_of_relations_between the west and beijing , which due to corona and trade war between them is at the lowest stage .   benefits for china from the sino - iranian deal   beijing , on_the_other_hand , is a big winner and plays a longer game . at iranian_ports , it could enjoy preferential_treatment and develop free_trade_zones around the country . it will also include discounts for iranian_oil . iran is to provide regular and discounted supply of oil to china for 25 years . \" china would also develop free - trade_zones in Maku , in northwestern iran ;
