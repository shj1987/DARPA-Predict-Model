A federal investigation into Hunter is ongoing, and Republicans vow to continue to probe how Hunter profited off his father\u2019s name, and what President-elect Biden knew about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to turn a blind eye on this,\u201d Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.)\n\nsaid last week\n\n. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep digging.\u201d\n\nBased on information from the laptop and interviews, here\u2019s what we know about the Chinese deal:\n\nJune 2009\n\nAs the Obama-Biden administration hit the halfway point of its inaugural year, Hunter Biden co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners, an investment fund, along with Christopher Heinz \u2014 the stepson of Obama\u2019s future Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 and Devon Archer, a former Kerry adviser.\n\nApril 7-9, 2010\n\nHunter Biden visited China as a Rosemont Seneca rep during the second year of his father\u2019s vice presidency. There he gained audiences with top officials of influential state-linked enterprises including the Postal Savings Bank, China Investment Corp., and Founder Group. He was joined on the trip by James Bulger, the politically connected co-founder of the Thornton Group, an Asia-oriented financial services firm.\n\n2012\n\nAs Joe Biden ran for his second term as vice president, Hunter Biden and Devon Archer made contact with Chinese financier Jonathan Li, who ran the private-equity fund Bohai Capital. The trio discussed a plan to become partners in a new operation that would invest Chinese cash in ventures outside the country. Eighty percent of the resulting company, Bohai Harvest, was controlled by Chinese state-owned interests.\n\nDecember 2013\n\nWhen Chinese president Xi Jinping\n\nalarmed the rest of Asia\n\nwith an aggressive expansion of his military claims over the East China Sea, Vice President Biden was\n\ndispatched to Beijing\n\nto try to de-escalate tensions. The second son tagged along on Air Force Two. While a somber and subdued Joe Biden held a marathon five-hour meeting with Xi, Hunter got together with Jonathan Li in what handlers at the time described as a social visit. The son even arranged for a handshake between Li and his father at the hotel of the American delegation \u2014 troubling some of the vice president\u2019s advisors,\n\naccording to the New Yorker.\n\nTen days later, the\u00a0Chinese business license for Bohai Harvest \u2014 the company that Hunter Biden and Devon Archer had been trying to launch for more than a year \u2014 was approved.\n\nYe Jianming\n\n2015\n\nAround this time Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship to Chinese tycoon Ye Jianming \u201cbegan to ramp up,\u201d\n\naccording to a Senate report\n\nreleased in September. Ye, the founder of Chinese energy giant CEFC, served as the nation\u2019s unofficial energy liaison to Russia.\n\nFeb. 23 and March 1, 2017\n\nA month after Biden left office, a total of $6 million in wire transfers were made from State Energy HK Ltd., a company controlled by Ye, to Robinson Walker LLC. That company was controlled by Rob Walker, a longtime business partner of Hunter\u2019s who had collaborated with him in at least three other companies. Walker\n\nserved in both\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s administrations \u2014 and his wife, Betsy Massey Walker, is\n\nreportedly\n\na former member of future First Lady\u2019s Jill Biden\u2019s personal staff. The Senate\u2019s joint Finance Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report said it was \u201cunclear what the true purpose is behind these transactions and who the ultimate beneficiary is.\u201d\n\nMay 2-3, 2017\n\nVenture capitalist Tony Bobulinski was\n\nrecruited by the Bidens\n\naround this time to serve as CEO of Sinohawk Holdings, which he describes as a partnership between Ye\u2019s CEFC and the Biden family. Bobulinski\n\nmet  twice with Joe Biden\n\nat the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, where the former veep was set to give a speech. Hunter, Bobulinski told The Post, \u201cbrings Joe over and introduces me, saying [Joe\u2019s] the one who\u2019s helping us with the business we\u2019re doing with the Chinese.\u201d  Biden responded, \u201cI trust you. Good luck and work hard\u201d \u2014 and added a second instruction the next morning: \u201cKeep an eye on my son and [brother Jim Biden] and look out for my family.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden has repeatedly denied any knowledge of his son\u2019s business operation. In September 2020 he\n\ntold reporters emphatically\n\n, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\nTony Bobulinski\n\nREUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nMay 11, 2017\n\nJames Gilliar, another Hunter Biden business associate, talked with Bobulinski about\n\nhow to \u201cget Joe involved\u201d\n\nin a joint venture with CEFC. The two discussed ways to make the effort look like a \u201ctruly family business\u201d in a series of text messages seen by The Post. \u201cLet\u2019s get the company set up, then tell H and family the high stakes and get Joe involved,\u201d Gilliar wrote. The texts were contained in a tranche of emails and documents released by Bobulinski.\n\nMay 13, 2017\n\nGilliar\n\nemailed Hunter Biden\n\nto outline remuneration packages for Hunter and five other people in an unspecified business venture. The email \u2014 found on the Hunter Biden laptop and exposed in a bombshell report by The Post \u2014 suggested equity shares were being assigned to Biden family members, with a note indicating that 10% would be held by Hunter \u201cfor the big guy\u201d \u2014 who Bobulinski later definitively identified as Joe Biden. Three days later, Bobulinski says, the plans changed: Joe Biden\u2019s 10% share would be held in the name of his brother Jim instead.\n\nBobulinski voiced his doubts about the wisdom of Joe Biden\u2019s involvement to Jim Biden, in light of his brother\u2019s political stature.\n\n\u201cI remember saying, \u2018How are you guys getting away with this? Aren\u2019t you concerned?\u2019\u201d Bobulinski\n\nsaid in an interview\n\nwith The Post\u2019s Michael Goodwin.\n\n\u201c\u2018Plausible deniability,'\u201d Jim Biden responded with a chuckle, Bobulinski recalled.\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention Joe being involved, it\u2019s only when u are face to face, I know u know that but they are paranoid,\u201d Gilliar\n\ninstructed Bobulinksi\n\nin an encrypted WhatsApp message thread. In response, Bobulinksi wrote, \u201cOK they should be paranoid about things.\u201d Later, Bobulinski added what seemed to be a warning about Joe Biden\u2019s future political plans: \u201cYou need to stress to H, does he want to be the reason or factor that blows up his dad\u2019s campaign.\u201d The former veep was still two years away from announcing his third White House bid.\n\nJune 18, 2017\n\nHunter Biden\n\nmade an urgent request\n\nto Ye Jianming to wire him $10 million as seed money for a new venture, SinoHawk Holdings, according to an email obtained by The Post. In the missive he said he was extending \u201cbest wishes from the entire Biden family\u201d and that \u201cWe are all hoping to see you here again soon, or in Shanghai.\u201d\n\nThe diamond sent to Hunter Biden by Ye Jianming.\n\nSummer 2017\n\nHunter met with Ye in Miami to solicit donations for World Food Program USA, according to the Senate report. Over dinner, they discussed details of helping the Chinese magnate find investments for CEFC in the United States. Afterward, Ye sent him a 2.8-carat diamond as a thank-you gift. \u201cI just felt like it was weird,\u201d Hunter later\n\ntold The New Yorker\n\n\u2014 but he accepted the gem. The rock later become a bone of contention in\n\ndivorce proceedings\n\nbetween Hunter Biden and first wife Kathleen Buhle.\n\nAug 1, 2017\n\nA hand-drawn flow chart included in the Senate report\n\nshows an ownership breakdown\n\nof an entity called \u201cHudson West\u201d with a 50/50 split between Biden and someone identified only as \u201cchairman.\u201d An email sent the next day strongly suggests the \u201cchairman\u201d in question was Ye Jianming \u2014 and notes that while Hunter was to have earned $10 million a year \u201cfor introductions alone,\u201d those earlier terms had been changed \u201cTO A MUCH MORE LASTING AND LUCRATIVE ARRANGEMENT.\u201d\n\nAug. 8, 2017\n\nYe\u2019s CEFC wired $5 million to Hudson West. That same day, the company began a year-long series of payments to Owasco, Hunter Biden\u2019s law firm, that would total $4.79 million, the Senate report found. Owasco subsequently sent $1.4 million \u2014 parceled out in 20  different wire transfers \u2014 to the Lion Hall Group, a consulting firm controlled by James Biden and his wife, Sara Biden.\n\nSept. 21, 2017\n\nHunter Biden emailed the Washington office building House of Sweden to\n\nrequest a set of keys\n\nfor Rosemont Seneca offices be produced for Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden and Gongwen Dong \u2014 all of whom were described as \u201coffice mates,\u201d according to another email. Hunter Biden also noted that Gongwen Dong was an \u201cemissary\u201d for CEFC and Ye.\n\nThe House of Sweden building.\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nChi Ping Patrick Ho, a Ye lieutenant,\n\nagreed to pay Hunter Biden\n\na $1 million retainer for \u201cCounsel to matters related to US law and advice pertaining to the hiring and legal analysis of any US Law Firm or Lawyer,\u201d according to an attorney engagement letter obtained by The Post.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nA Manhattan federal jury convicted Ho for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by trying to bribe government officials in Africa. He was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\n2018\n\nThe Department of Justice opens a probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s tax affairs, business ties in China and the Ukraine and documents covering his involvement in more than two dozen entities, according to a\n\nDec. 13, 2020 report by the Associated Press.\n\nAt least one 2017 email notes Hunter Biden failed to disclose $400,000 in income he earned while on the board of the Ukrainian Energy company Burisma.\n\n2018\n\nYe Jianming vanishes in China amid suspicions of \u201ceconomic crimes.\u201d\n\nApril 12, 2019\n\nHunter Biden\n\nleft a waterlogged laptop\n\nat a Delaware computer repair store owned by John Paul Mac Isaac seeking repairs. The computer bore a sticker for the Beau Biden Foundation, named for his deceased brother.

But it will take you more than that to take it from Djibouti to Addis Ababa. It will now take us one day or more,\" he said.\n\nAt the opening ceremony on Wednesday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said that the rail line would be a boost to the economy.\n\n\"It will provide huge benefits to the industrial parks and modern farms that will be built in the future,\" he said.\n\nimage caption\n\nIn a test run on Wednesday, invited guests were taken on a short ride of one of the trains\n\nA businessman at the opening told the BBC that the railway \"would transform\" his trade in transporting livestock.\n\n\"It will be easier, more efficient,\" he said.\n\nThe railway was 70% financed by China's Exim Bank and built by China Railway Group and China Civil Engineering Construction.\n\nChinese controllers, technicians and station masters are among those staffing the services for the next five year after which Ethiopians will be employed.\n\nMr Getachew told the AFP news agency that their local counterparts are in training.\n\nimage copyright\n\nAFP\n\nimage caption\n\nChinese staff are contracted to manage the trains for five years\n\nimage copyright\n\nAFP\n\nimage caption\n\nLocal counterparts will be trained during that time\n\nDjibouti is important to landlocked Ethiopia which currently imports and exports nearly 90% of its goods through its port.\n\nBefore construction was completed freight services transported food to areas affected by drought last year.\n\nimage copyright\n\nAFP\n\nimage caption\n\nThe rail line starts off with freight services\n\nThe railway is the first step in a vast 5,000km-long network of rail which Ethiopia hopes to build by 2020, connecting it to Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nThe dream is that one day\n\nthe railway will extend from Djibouti's coast all the way across Africa to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nimage copyright\n\nReuters\n\nimage caption\n\nThe trains go through Adama train station in the Oromia region of Ethiopia\n\nRelated Topics\n\nDjibouti\n\nRail travel\n\nEngineering\n\nInfrastructure\n\nEthiopia\n\nMore on this story\n\nCan Ethiopia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s railway bring peace to Somalia?\n\nPublished\n\n23 November 2015\n\nIs Ethiopia's building boom masking poverty?\n\nPublished\n\n16 April 2015\n\nEthiopia country profile\n\nPublished\n\n5 November 2020\n\nDjibouti profile\n\nPublished\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAround the BBC\n\nAfrica Today podcasts\n\nTop Stories\n\nDozens killed as train crashes in Taiwan tunnel\n\nAt least 48 people are dead and scores more injured in the island's worst rail disaster in decades.\n\nPublished\n\n18 minutes ago\n\nFloyd 'had no pulse' when paramedics arrived\n\nPublished\n\n12 hours ago\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy' Video\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy'\n\nPublished\n\n13 hours ago\n\nFeatures\n\nCelebrity rush exposes Australian 'double standard'\n\nThen and now: Rising temperatures threaten corals\n\nWeekly quiz: TV bust-ups and 'Satan Shoes'\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy' Video\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy'\n\nWorld's deepest-known shipwreck finally seen\n\n'The China media war that pushed me out\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nRiz Ahmed: 'Listening is not just with your ears'\n\nFive takeaways from Biden's White House cabinet\n\nThe pain of being alone behind bars\u00c2\n\nElsewhere on the BBC\n\nFootball phrases\n\n15 sayings from around the world\n\nMost Read\n\nMan beaten up by 'furious octopus' in Australia\n\n1\n\nCelebrity rush exposes Australian 'double standard'\n\n2\n\nYouTuber admits to messaging with 16-year-olds\n\n3\n\nDozens killed as train crashes in Taiwan tunnel\n\n4\n\nSub dives to deepest-known shipwreck\n\n5\n\nTrump sanctions on Italian restaurant were mistake\n\n6\n\nNike wins lawsuit to halt sale of 'Satan Shoes'\n\n7\n\nMore countries added to England's travel ban list\n\n8\n\nStock markets hit new records on Biden spending plan\n\n9\n\nCricket legend Tendulkar in hospital with Covid-19\n\n10\n\nBBC News Services\n\nOn your mobile\n\nOn smart speakers\n\nGet news alerts\n\nContact BBC News\n\nHome\n\nNews\n\nSport\n\nReel\n\nWorklife\n\nTravel\n\nFuture\n\nCulture\n\nMusic\n\nTV\n\nWeather\n\nSounds\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout the BBC\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies\n\nAccessibility Help\n\nParental Guidance\n\nContact the BBC\n\nGet Personalised Newsletters\n\nWhy you can trust the BBC\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 BBC.

Image: Getty\n\nStacked Farm, an Australian automated vertical indoor farm, has received international interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about the continuity of food supplies.\n\nThe farm produces salad greens and has the capacity for tomatoes and strawberries.\n\nCEO Conrad Smith told Business Insider Australia Stack Farm received significant interest from the Middle East.\n\nVisit Business Insider Australia\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nAussie company Stacked Farm, a fully automated vertical indoor farm, has been gaining international interest amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStacked Farm, founded in 2017, produces salad greens and herbs like lettuce and rocket, and has the capacity tp produce tomatoes and strawberries. It\u2019s even looking at testing out a type of blueberry next year.\n\nThe company has been receiving a lot of interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about virus clusters breaking out in the food supply chain. Back in May, a coronavirus cluster broke out at Melbourne\u2019s Cedar Meats abattoir, which was linked to 62 cases,\n\naccording to the ABC\n\n.\n\n\u201cPeople are more concerned than ever about who is handling their food, where it\u2019s coming from and how many stops it made before arriving on supermarket shelves,\u201d Stacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith said in a statement.\n\nThe company is headquartered in Burleigh Heads, Queensland and has plans to open up farms across Australia as well. \u201cA scaled-up farm in Victoria will be our first major commercial farm,\u201d Smith told Business Insider Australia. Its farm is fully automated, with the produce packed and sealed once its harvested by robotic farming.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pass through the usual supply chains either \u2013 greens and herbs can go directly to wholesalers, retails, hotels and restaurants, unlike traditional produce which passes through a number of hands before reaching our shelves,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\nStacked Farm has a partnership with fresh produce supplier Morco Fresh and counts Dnata as one of its clients as well, which provides aircraft services like flight catering.\n\n\u201cWe are not too dissimilar to a normal farm where we go through markets and we go through wholesalers and food service distributors,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAnd while it mainly supplies to the food service industry, Stacked Farm is looking at a move into retail so people can grab its produce from supermarket shelves as well. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the capacity to do that at the moment,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut when we scale up to our Victorian farm, we will certainly have the capacity to do that and we\u2019ll be looking for retail partners to jump on the journey that we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nThe farms are temperature controlled and automated\n\nStacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith. Image: Troy Archer\n\nStacked Farm grows its produce 12 months a year, without relying on different seasons. Its products are grown in a temperature-controlled environment that is fully automated from seeding to harvesting. The company is looking at post-harvest automation as part of its next business phase.\n\nStacked Farm also makes barley-based livestock feed. \u201cIn a drought-vulnerable country like Australia, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there because while we all think about human consumption, animals are a massive part of the food chain that needs to be considered,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe company\u2019s employees are mainly in the science and tech field rather than traditional farm labourers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not like traditional farms where we require pickers, packers and harvesters,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe employ more labour leaning towards engineering, software engineering, mechanical engineering, CAD designers [and] horticultural scientists.\u201d\n\nThe company has been receiving interest from the Middle East\n\nStacked Farm has received international interest in its farm during the coronavirus pandemic, mainly thanks to concerns over food safety, quality and security.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of food chains that have been broken throughout this COVID-19 pandemic, and we\u2019ve had interest from the Middle East to set up farms there,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cWe have been very enthused by the interest from particularly a couple of states in the Middle East that have governments that really support local industry and local farming.\u201d Smith gave the example of Dubai which relies predominantly on imports.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\n\n, the United Arab Emirates imports up to 90% of its food.\n\nSmith explained that in Dubai, \u201ca lot of produce can\u2019t travel by sea\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve immediately recognised that there\u2019s a problem in their food chain and they need to bring tech businesses to their country to support feeding their people.\u201d And, in the case of Stacked Farm, can help feed livestock too.\n\nSmith added that Stacked Farm can support the future of food production, particularly in extremely hot and dry or extremely cold climates. He explained that\n\none in nine people go hungry\n\naround the world.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations\n\n, by 2050 world food demand is expected to rise by 70%.\n\n\u201cHaving urban indoor vertical farms is definitely [an] exciting prospect for the future,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe can literally shave days off out of the logistics process, we can extend the shelf life of products so there\u2019s less wastage and that in turn will benefit the community.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on\n\nFacebook\n\n,\n\nTwitter\n\n,\n\nLinkedIn\n\n, and\n\nInstagram\n\n.\n\nTagged In\n\naustralian stories\n\ncoronavirus\n\nfood chain\n\nqueensland\n\nstacked farm\n\nBusiness Insider Research\n\nI adopted a dog in 2020, and this handheld vacuum cleaner helped me keep fur off every surface in my house\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nBusiness Insider Australia\n\nContact Editor\n\nGot A Story Tip?\n\nReport Issue\n\nBusiness Insider Video\n\nA company in Uganda is turning the waste from bananas into rugs, place mats, and baskets\n\nHow metalworkers in India are keeping the 600-year-old craft of Bidri art alive\n\nPopular on Facebook\n\nDoing these 24 uncomfortable things will pay off forever\n\nYes, Apple just killed iTunes \u2014 here's what that means for your library of music, movies, and TV shows\n\nWe took a 4-hour flight on the new Delta Airbus jet that Boeing tried to keep out of the US.

Frances Greger arrived in a wheelchair. \u201cMrs. Greger had heart disease, angina, and claudication; her condition was so bad she could no longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs. \u00a0Within three weeks, though she was not only out of her wheelchair but was walking ten miles a day.\u201d\n\nThis is my grandma at her grandson\u2019s wedding 15 years after she was given her medical death sentence, and thanks to a healthy diet, she was able to live\u00a0another 31 years on this earth\u2014until 96\u2014to enjoy her six grandkids, including me.\n\nThat is why I went into medicine.\n\nWhen Dr. Ornish published his Lifestyle Heart Trial years later, proving with quantitative angiography that coronary artery\u00a0disease could indeed be reversed in the majority of patients without drugs or surgery\u2014just a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle changes, I assumed that it was going to be a game-changer. My family had seen it with their own eyes, but finally here it was in black and white, published in one of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals on the planet. But, nothing happened\u2014 leaving me to wonder if, effectively, the cure to our #1\u00a0killer could get lost down some rabbit hole and ignored, then, what else might be in the medical literature that can help my patients? I made it my life\u2019s mission to find out.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with my work, every year I read through every issue of every English-language nutrition journal in the world\u2014so busy folks like you don\u2019t have to.\n\nI then compile all the most interesting, the most groundbreaking, the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day to\u00a0my nonprofit site, NutritionFacts.org.\n\nEverything on the website is free. There are no ads, no corporate sponsorships. It\u2019s strictly noncommercial, not selling anything. I just put it up as a public service, as a labor of love.\n\nNew videos and articles\n\nevery day\n\n, on the latest in\n\nevidence-based\n\nnutrition. What a concept!\n\nWhere did Pritikin get his evidence from? A network of missionary hospitals set up by Western doctors throughout sub-Saharan Africa uncovered what may be one of the most important advances in health, according to one of our\u00a0most famous medical figures of the 20th century, Dr. Denis Burkitt: the fact that many of the most common and major diseases \u201cin modern Western culture are universally rare in third world communities.\u201d\n\nLike, heart disease. This landmark article from the 50s started out with a shocking statement: \u201cIn the African population of Uganda, coronary heart disease is almost non-existent.\u201d Wait a second, our #1 cause of death, almost nonexistent? What were they eating?\n\nThey were eating a lot of starchy vegetables, starchy grains, and greens, and their protein almost exclusively\u00a0from plant sources, and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it. Actually, very similar to those eating modern-day, plant-based diets.\n\nMaybe the Africans were just dying early from some\u00a0other kind of diseases\u2014and so, never lived long enough to have a heart attack? No, here are\n\nage-matched\n\nheart attack rates in Uganda versus St. Louis. Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda, only one myocardial infarction. Out of 632 age- and gender-matched autopsies in Missouri, 136 myocardial infarctions: more than 100 times the rate of our #1 killer.\n\nIn fact, they were so blown away they went back and did another 800 autopsies in Uganda, and still, just that one small healed infarct (meaning it wasn\u2019t even the cause of death) out of 1,427 patients\u2014less than one in a thousand; whereas here, heart disease is an epidemic.\n\nThis is a list of diseases commonly found in the U.S. (and in populations that eat and live like the U.S.), but are rare or even nonexistent in populations centering their diets around\n\nwhole plant foods\n\n.\n\nThese are among our most\n\ncommon\n\ndiseases, like obesity, for example, or hiatal hernia, one of the most common stomach problems. Varicose veins and hemorrhoids\u2014two of the most common venous problems; colorectal cancer\u2014a leading cause of cancer-related death; diverticulitis\u2014the #1 disease of the intestines; appendicitis\u2014the #1 cause of\u00a0emergency abdominal surgery; gallbladder disease\u2014the #1 cause of\n\nnonemergency\n\nabdominal surgery; as well as\u00a0ischemic heart disease\u2014the\n\ncommonest cause of death\n\nhere, but a rarity among plant-based populations.\n\nThis suggests heart disease may be a\n\nchoice\n\n. Like cavities. If you look at the teeth of people who lived over 10,000 years before the invention of the toothbrush, they pretty much had no cavities. Didn\u2019t brush a day in their lives; no flossing; yet, no cavities. That\u2019s because candy bars hadn\u2019t been invented yet.\n\nWhy do people continue to get cavities when we know they\u2019re preventable through diet? Simple. Because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist\u2019s chair for many people. And, that\u2019s fine!\n\nLook, as long as people understand the consequences of their actions, as a physician, what more can I do? If you\u2019re an adult, and decide the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family, then, go for it\u2014I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence (I\u2019ve got a good dental plan).\n\nBut, what if instead of the plaque on our teeth, we\u2019re talking about the plaque building up inside of our arteries? This is another disease that can be prevented by changing our diet.\n\nNow, what are the consequences for you and your family? Now, we\u2019re not talking about scraping tartar anymore. Now, we\u2019re talking life and death. The most likely reason that most of our loved ones will die is because of heart disease. It\u2019s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live\u2014but we should make these\u00a0choices consciously, educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions.\n\nCoronary heart disease; atherosclerosis; hardening of the arteries, begins in\n\nchildhood\n\n.\n\nBy age 10, the arteries of nearly all kids raised on the standard American diet already have fatty streaks\u2014the first stage of the disease.\n\nThen, these plaques start forming in our 20s, get worse in our 30s, and then, can start killing us off. In our hearts, it\u2019s called a heart attack; in our brains, the same disease is\u00a0called a stroke.\n\nIf there is\n\nanyone\n\nin this audience older than age 10, then the question\u00a0isn\u2019t whether or not to eat healthy to\n\nprevent\n\nheart disease; it\u2019s whether you want to\n\nreverse\n\nthe heart disease that you already have.\n\nIs that even possible? When researchers took people with heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by those populations that didn\u2019t suffer from heart disease, their hope was to slow the disease process down\u2014maybe even stop it. But instead, something miraculous happened.\n\nThe disease started to reverse, to get better. As soon as patients stopped eating an artery-clogging diet, their arteries started opening up. \u00a0Their bodies were able to start dissolving some of the plaque away. Even in some cases of severe triple vessel heart disease, arteries opened up without drugs, without surgery\u2014suggesting their bodies wanted to heal all along, but were just never given the chance. This improvement in blood flow to the heart is after just three weeks of eating healthy.\n\nLet me share with you the best-kept secret in medicine. The best-kept secret in medicine is that sometimes, given the right conditions, our\u00a0body can heal itself.\n\nIf you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get all red, hot, swollen, and inflamed, but will heal naturally if we just stand back and let our body work its magic. But what if we\n\nkept\n\nwhacking it in the same place three times a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) every day? It\u2019d never heal.\n\nYou\u2019d go to your doctor and say, \u201cMy shin hurts.\u201d And the doctor would be like, no problem, whip out their pad, and write you a prescription for painkillers. You\u2019re still whacking your shin three times a day, but it feels so much better with the pain pills on board. Thank heavens for modern medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s like when taking\u00a0nitroglycerine for crushing chest pain. Tremendous relief, but you\u2019re not actually treating the underlying cause of the disease.\n\nOur body wants to come back to health, if we let it. But if we keep re-injuring it three times a day, we may never heal.\n\nIt\u2019s like smoking. One of the most\n\namazing\n\nthings I learned in medical school was that within about 15 years of stopping smoking, our lung cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Our lungs can clear out all that tar, and eventually, it\u2019s almost as if\u00a0we never started smoking at all.\n\nEvery morning of our smoking life, that healing process started until, wham, our first cigarette of the day, re-injuring our lungs with every puff. Just like we can re-injure our arteries with every bite, when all we had to do all along\u2014the miracle cure, was to just stand back, get out of the way, stop re-damaging ourselves, and let our bodies\u2019 natural healing processes bring us back towards health.\n\nSure, you could choose moderation, and hit yourself with a smaller hammer. But why beat yourself up at all?\n\nThe human body is a self-healing machine.\n\nWe\u2019ve known about this for decades.\n\nAmerican Heart Journal\n\n, 1977: cases like Mr. F.W. here; such severe angina he couldn\u2019t even make it to the mailbox, but then started eating healthier, and a few months later, he was climbing mountains, no pain.\n\nThere are some fancy new anti-angina drugs on the market now that cost thousands of dollars a year. But at the highest dose, they can successfully prolong exercise duration, extending the time someone can walk on a treadmill as long as 33\u00a01/2\u00a0seconds.\n\nIt does not look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.\n\nYou see, plant-based diets aren\u2019t just safer and cheaper, but they\u00a0can work\n\nbetter\n\n.\n\nKiller #2\u00a0is cancer. What happens if we put cancer on a plant-based diet? Dean Ornish and colleagues found that the progression of prostate cancer could be reversed with a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle behaviors\u2014and no wonder.\n\nIf you drip the blood of those eating the standard American diet onto cancer cells growing in a petri dish, cancer growth is cut down by about 9%. But put people on a plant-based diet for a year, though, and their blood can do this. The blood circulating within the bodies of those eating\u00a0plant-based diets has nearly eight\u00a0times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth.\n\nNow, this was for prostate cancer\u2014the leading cancer killer specific to men. In women, it\u2019s breast cancer. So, researchers tried duplicating the study with women, using breast cancer cells instead. They didn\u2019t want to wait a whole year to get the results, though. So, they figured they\u2019d see what a healthy diet could do in just two weeks, against three different types of human breast cancer cells.\n\nThis was the before: cancer growth powering away at 100%. And then, after eating a plant-based diet for 14 days.\n\nHere\u2019s the before picture: a layer of breast cancer cells is laid down in a petri dish, and then blood from women eating the standard American diet is dripped on them. And as you can see, even people eating crappy diets have some ability to break down cancer. But after just two\u00a0weeks eating healthy, blood was drawn from those same women\u2014so, they acted as their own controls\u2014dripped on another carpet of breast cancer cells, and this is what they were left with; just a few individual cancer cells left. Their bodies just cleaned up.\n\nBefore, and after; just two weeks eating healthy. Their blood became that much more hostile to cancer.\n\nSlowing down the growth of cancer cells is nice, but getting rid of them is even better. This is what\u2019s called apoptosis, programmed cell death. After eating healthy, their own bodies were able to reprogram the cancer cells, forcing them into early retirement.\n\nThis is what\u2019s called TUNEL imaging, measuring\u00a0DNA fragmentation or cell death. Dying cells show up as white spots. So, again, this is the before\u2014what the blood of the average woman eating a standard American diet can do to breast cancer cells. Her blood may be able to kill off a few. But then, after 14 days of healthy plant-based living, her blood can do this. It\u2019s like she\u2019s an entirely different person inside.\n\nThe same blood that was now coursing through these women\u2019s bodies gained the power to significantly slow down and stop breast cancer cell growth, within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\nof eating a plant-based diet.\n\nWhat kind of blood do we want in our body; what kind of immune system? Do we want blood that just kind of rolls over when new cancer cells pop up, or do we want blood circulating to every nook and cranny of our body with the power to slow down and stop them?\n\nNow, this dramatic strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plant-based diet\n\nand\n\nexercise; they had these women\u00a0out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day. Well, wait a second, if you do two things, how do you know what role the diet played? So, the researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\nThis is measuring cancer cell clearance. This is what we saw before; the effect of blood taken from those who ate a plant-based diet\u2014in this case for an average of 14 years\u2014along with mild exercise, like just walking every day. Plant-based diet and walking\u2014that\u2019s the kind of cancer cell clearance you get. Compare that to the cancer-stopping power of your average sedentary meat-eater, which is basically nonexistent.\n\nThis middle group is interesting, though. Instead of 14 years on a plant-based diet, ate 14 years of a standard American diet\u2014\n\nbut\n\n, had 14 years of daily, strenuous, hour-long exercise, like calisthenics.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if you exercise long enough, if you exercise hard enough, can you rival some strolling plant-eaters?\n\nAnd the answer is, exercise helped\u2014no question, but literally 5,000 hours in the gym was no match for a plant-based diet.\n\nSame thing as before. Even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes, your body\u2019s not totally defenseless. Your bloodstream can kill off a few cancer cells. But here\u2019s the hard core strenuous exercise group, killing off cancer cells left and right.\n\nBut nothing appears to kick more cancer tush than a plant-based diet.\n\nWe think it\u2019s because of the animal proteins\u2014meat, egg white, and dairy proteins\u2014increasing the level of IGF-1 in our bodies. Insulin-like growth factor-1, a cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in the acquisition and progression of malignant tumors.\n\nBut if we lower animal protein intake, if you put people on a plant-based diet, their IGF-1 levels go down, and if you put people\u00a0on a plant-based diet for years, their levels drop even further.\n\nAnd their IGF-1\n\nbinding protein\n\nlevels go up. That\u2019s one way our body tries to protect itself from cancer\u2014from excessive growth\u2014by releasing a binding protein into our bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF-1. It\u2019s like our body\u2019s emergency brake. Yes, in as little as two\u00a0weeks, a plant-based diet can bring down your liver\u2019s production of IGF-1 . But what about all the IGF-1 circulating in your bloodstream from the bacon and eggs you had three weeks before? So, your liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to take it out of circulation. And, as you can see, it just gets better and better, the longer you eat healthy.\n\nHere\u2019s the experiment that nailed IGF-1 as the villain; same as last time. Go on a plant-based diet, cancer cell growth drops, and cancer cell death shoots up. But then, here\u2019s the kicker: what if you added back to the cancer the exact same amount of IGF-1 banished from your system just\u00a0because you were eating healthy for two weeks? It erases the diet and exercise effect. It\u2019s like you never started eating healthy at all.\n\nSo, the reason the largest prospective study on diet and cancer ever found that the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meat-eaters may be because they eat less animal protein. So, they end up with less IGF-1, which can mean less cancer growth.\n\nHow much less cancer are we talking about? Middle-aged men and women with high protein intakes had a 75% increase in total\u00a0mortality, and a four\n\n\u2013\n\nfold\u00a0increase in the risk of dying from cancer. But not all proteins; specifically animal protein, which makes sense, of course, given the higher IGF-1 levels.\n\nThe academic institution sent out a press release with a memorable opening line: \u201cThat chicken wing you\u2019re eating could be as deadly as a cigarette,\u201d explaining that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer\u2014\u201da mortality risk factor comparable to smoking.\u201d\n\nWhat was the response to the revelation that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking? One nutrition scientist replied that it was potentially dangerous to compare the effects of smoking with the effect of meat and cheese. Why? Because a smoker might think, \u201cWhy bother quitting smoking if my ham\u00a0and cheese\u00a0sandwich is just as bad for me?\u201d So, better not to tell anyone about the whole meat and dairy thing.\n\nThat reminds me of a famous Philip Morris cigarette ad that tried to downplay the risks by saying, \u201cYou think secondhand smoke is bad, increasing the risk of lung cancer 19%? Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of milk every day may be three times as bad\u201462% increased\u00a0risk of lung cancer.\u201d Or doubling the risk by frequently cooking with oil, or tripling your risk of heart disease by eating non-vegetarian, or multiplying your risk six-fold by eating lots of meat and dairy. So, they conclude, \u201cLet\u2019s keep a sense of\n\nperspective\n\nhere.\u201d The risk of lung cancer from secondhand smoke may be \u201cwell below the risk reported for other everyday activities.\u201d So, breathe deep.\n\nThat\u2019s like saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about getting stabbed, because getting shot is so much worse.\u201d\n\nUh, how about neither? Two risks don\u2019t make a right.\n\nYou\u2019ll note Philip Morris stopped throwing dairy under the bus when they purchased Kraft Foods.\n\nOkay, what about the other\u00a013 leading causes of death?\n\nThe top three killers used to be heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Oh, that is\n\nso\n\n2007. Now, it\u2019s heart disease, cancer, and COPD\u2014chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, like emphysema. Thankfully, COPD can be prevented with the help of a plant-based diet, and even treated with plants; improving lung function over time.\n\nOf course, the tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently. Instead of adding plants to one\u2019s\n\ndiet\n\nto help one\u2019s lung function, wouldn\u2019t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes? And indeed, the addition of a\u00e7a\u00ed berries to cigarettes evidently has a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice. Who would have thunk it?\n\nNext, they\u2019re going to be putting berries in meat. And indeed, I couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. The addition of\u00a0fruit extracts to burgers was not without its glitches, though. The blackberries \u201cliterally dyed burger patties with a distinct purplish colour\u201d\u2014though, evidently, infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in does evidently improve tenderness. And, it\u2019s even possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurters with powdered grape seeds, though, there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product. And if there\u2019s one thing we know about hot dog-eaters, it\u2019s that they\u2019re picky about what goes in their food.\n\nPig anus? Okay, but grape seeds? Eww!\n\nStrokes are killer #4. Preventing strokes may be all about eating potassium-rich foods, yet most Americans don\u2019t even reach the recommended\n\nminimum\n\ndaily intake. And by most, I mean more than 98%. 98% of us eat potassium-deficient diets, because 98% of us don\u2019t eat enough plants.\n\nPotassium comes from the words pot ash. You take any plant, put it in a pot, and reduce it to ash, and you\u2019re left with pot-ash-ium, so-called vegetable alkali. True story, but can anyone name me a plant food particularly high in potassium?\n\nBananas, right? I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s like the one thing everyone knows about nutrition. Chiquita must have had a great PR firm or something. But it turns out that bananas don\u2019t even make the top 50 sources, coming in at number 86, right behind fast food vanilla milk shakes. It goes fast food vanilla milk shakes,\n\nthen\n\nbananas.\n\nIn fact, when I was researching for my new book, I found out that the USDA expanded their list, and now bananas don\u2019t even make the top\n\nthousand\n\nsources\n\n;\n\ncoming in at number 1,611, right after Reese\u2019s Pieces. I kid you not. The most concentrated whole food sources of potassium in the diet are: beans, and greens, and dates.\n\nBananas don\u2019t make it to a thousand\u2014in fact, if you look at the next leading cause of death (unintentional injuries), bananas could be downright dangerous.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is now our sixth leading killer, now striking\u00a0a staggering four\u00a0million Americans affected. Twenty\u00a0years ago, it wasn\u2019t even in the top ten. According to the latest dietary guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s, the two most important things we can do: cut down our consumption of meat, dairy, and junk; and replace those\u00a0with vegetables, beans, fruits, and whole grains.\n\nThis is based, in part, on data going back over 20\u00a0years now. Those who eat meat\u2014red meat or white meat, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014appear between two\u00a0to three\u00a0times more likely to become demented later in life, compared to those that don\u2019t eat meat. And the longer one eats meat-free, the lower the risk of dementia drops.\n\nNext on the list: type 2 diabetes, which we can prevent, arrest, and reverse with a plant-based diet\u2014something we\u2019ve known since back in the 1930s. Within five\u00a0years, about a quarter of the diabetics were able to get off insulin.\n\nBut plant-based diets are low-calorie diets. Maybe their diabetes just got better because they lost so much weight? To tease that out, what we would need is a study where researchers switch people to a healthy diet, but force them to eat so much food that they wouldn\u2019t\u00a0lose any weight, despite eating healthier. Then, we could see if plant-based diet had unique benefits beyond all the weight loss. We\u2019d have to wait 44 years, but here it is: subjects were weighed every day, and if they started losing weight, they were made to eat more food. In fact, so much food, some of the participants had problems\u00a0eating it all\u2014like \u201cnot another tostada, not another salad.\u201d But they eventually adapted; so, there was no significant alteration in body weight, despite restricting meat, dairy, eggs, and junk.\n\nSo, with zero weight loss, did a plant-based diet still help? Overall, insulin requirements were cut about 60%, and half were able to get off insulin altogether despite no change in weight. How many years did this\u00a0take? No, 16\n\ndays\n\n.\n\nSo, we\u2019re talking diabetics who\u2019ve had diabetes for as long as 20\u00a0years, injecting 20 units of insulin a day. And then, as few as 13 days later, they\u2019re off of all insulin altogether, thanks to less than two weeks on a plant-based diet\u2014even with zero weight loss. Diabetes for 20 years, then off all insulin in two\u00a0weeks. Diabetes for 20 years, because no one had told them about a plant-based diet. Here\u2019s patient 15; 32 units of insulin on the control diet, and then, 18 days later, on none. Lower blood sugars on 32 units\n\nless\n\ninsulin. That\u2019s the power of plants. This was without weight loss; his body just started working that much better.\n\nAnd as a bonus, their cholesterol dropped like a rock to under 150, in just 16 days. Just like moderate changes in diet usually result in only modest reductions in cholesterol, how moderate do you want your diabetes?\n\nEverything in moderation may be a truer statement than many people realize. Moderate changes in diet can leave diabetics with moderate vision loss, moderate kidney failure, and moderate amputations\u2014maybe just a few\u00a0toes or something? Moderation in all things is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nThat study that purported to show that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking supposedly suggested that people who eat lots of animal protein are four times as likely to die from cancer or diabetes. But if you look at the actual study, you\u2019ll see that\u2019s not true. Those eating lots of animal protein didn\u2019t have just four\u00a0times more risk of dying from diabetes;\n\nthey had 73 times higher risk of dying from diabetes.\n\nThose who chose moderation\u2014eating a moderate amount of animal protein\u2014only had 23 times the risk of death from diabetes.\n\nKiller #8 is kidney failure, which may be both prevented and treated with a plant-based diet. And no surprise; kidneys are highly vascular organs. Harvard researchers found three dietary risk factors for declining kidney function: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. Animal fat can alter the actual structure of our kidneys, based on studies like this, showing plugs of fat literally clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys.\n\nAnd the animal\n\nprotein\n\ncan have a profound effect on normal kidney function, inducing what\u2019s called hyperfiltration; increasing the workload on the kidney, but not plant protein. Eat some\u00a0tuna fish, and you can see increased pressure on the kidneys one, two, and three\u00a0hours after the meal; shoots right up. If, instead of having a tuna salad sandwich, though, you\u00a0had a\n\ntofu\n\nsalad sandwich with the same amount of protein, no effect. Kidneys can deal with plant protein\u00a0without even batting an eyelash.\n\nWhy does\n\nanimal\n\nprotein cause the overload reaction, but not plant protein? It appears to be due to inflammation triggered by the animal protein. We know this because if you give a powerful anti-inflammatory drug along with the tuna fish, you can actually abolish that hyperfiltration effect, that protein leakage effect in response to meat ingestion.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the acid load. Animal protein induces the formation of acid within the kidney, which may lead to tubular toxicity: damage to the delicate urine-making tubes within the kidney. Animal foods tend to be acid-forming, whereas plant foods tend to either be relatively neutral or actually alkaline,\n\nbase\n\n-forming, to counteract some of that acid. So, the solution to halting the progression of chronic kidney disease might lie\u00a0in the produce aisle\u00a0rather than the pharmacy aisle.\n\nNo wonder plant-based diets have been used to\n\ntreat\n\nkidney disease for decades. Here\u2019s protein leakage on the low-sodium diet that physicians would conventionally put these patients on; switched to a supplemented vegan diet; conventional; plant-based; conventional; plant-based\u2014turning kidney dysfunction on and off like a light switch, based on what\u2019s going into their mouths.\n\nKiller #9 is respiratory infections. What possible role could diet play? You obviously haven\u2019t seen my video\n\nKale and the Immune System\n\n, talking about the immunostimulatory effects of kale. Is there anything kale cannot do?\n\nBoosting antibody production seven-fold; but that\u2019s in a petri dish. What about in people? Older men and women were split into two groups right before they were going to get their Pneumovax vaccination (their pneumonia vaccination). Half continued to eat as they always had. The other half added just a few servings of fruits and vegetables to their daily diet, and after getting their injection, you can see a significant improvement in the protective antibody immune response from that one simple change. That wasn\u2019t cutting out meat; just adding fruits and vegetables can significantly improve immune function.\n\nKiller #10 is suicide. We\u2019ve known those eating healthier have healthier mood states\u2014in fact, only about half the depression, anxiety, and stress scores compared to those that eat meat. Researchers suspect it\u2019s the arachidonic acid, this\u00a0inflammatory long chain omega-6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs. That\u2019s where it\u2019s predominantly found in the American diet. But you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s cause and effect, until you put it to the test.\n\nThey took people eating the standard American diet, and removed meat, fish, poultry, and eggs from their diets, and got a significant improvement in mood scores within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\n. Thanks, perhaps, to the removal of arachidonic acid from their bodies, which they thought may be adversely impacting mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation; brain inflammation, but we\u00a0could bring that down\u00a0within a matter of weeks after cutting eggs, chicken, and other meat.\n\nNow, am I just cherry picking, though? What about all the randomized controlled trials like that, showing that\n\nother\n\ndiets have improved mood?\n\nThere aren\u2019t any.\n\nA recent review concluded that\n\nonly\n\nthe plant-based study fit the bill. It\u2019s hard to cherry pick when there\u2019s only one cherry.\n\nWorks in a workplace setting too: significant increases in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health\u2014not surprisingly, translating into improved work productivity. The biggest such study, across 15 corporate sites at Geico, found that plant-based diets resulted in significant reported improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and emotional well-being. So, lifestyle interventions, such as exercise, can help\n\nmental\n\nas well as physical health. And among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets.\n\nKiller #11 is blood infections. Sure, foodborne bacteria can kind of burrow through the bloodstream and directly invade through the intestinal wall\u2014but in women, may creep up into their bladder.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for decades that it\u2019s bacteria creeping up from the rectum that cause bladder infections. But only recently did we figure out where that rectal reservoir of bladder-infecting\n\nE. coli\n\nwas coming from: chicken. We now have DNA fingerprinting proof of a direct link between farm animals, meat, and bladder infections\u2014solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis, bladder infections as an animal-to-human disease.\n\nWait a second. Can\u2019t I\u00a0just use a meat thermometer and cook the meat through? No, because of cross-contamination. We\u2019ve known for decades that if you give someone a frozen chicken to prepare and cook in their own kitchen as they normally would, a multitude of antibiotic-resistant\n\nE. coli\n\njump from the chicken into the gut of the volunteer \u2014before they even eat it! So, you could incinerate it to ash; you don\u2019t even have to eat any of it. And it still wouldn\u2019t matter, because you already infected yourself just handling it.\n\nWithin days, the drug-resistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person\u2019s gut flora. The chicken bacteria were like taking over their intestines.\n\nEven if you follow all the safe handling guidelines, rinsing everything with bleach\u2014even spraying bleach on for good measure, there still may be pathogenic fecal bacteria left behind. No one actually does this, but what if you did this, and then came in later and swabbed kitchen surfaces? Researchers found pathogenic fecal bacteria: salmonella, campylobacter\u2014both serious human pathogens, still left behind in the kitchen. The reason that most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen sink than on their toilet seat is because most people rinse chickens in the sink, not the toilet. So, unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab, the only way to guarantee we\u2019re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into our homes in the first place.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s not like you eat chicken once, and you\u2019re colonized for life. In this study, the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about ten\u00a0days before our good bacteria were able to muscle them out of the way. The problem is that most families eat chicken more than once every ten days; so, they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems.\n\nBut wait a second. You can\u2019t sell unsafe cars; you can\u2019t sell unsafe toys; how is it legal to sell unsafe meat?\n\nThey do it by blaming the consumer. As one USDA poultry microbiologist said: \u201cRaw meats are not idiot-proof. They can be mishandled and when they are, it\u2019s like handling a hand grenade. If you pull the pin, somebody\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d See, if we get sick, it\u2019s our fault.\n\nWhile some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in supermarkets, the USDA poultry expert disagrees. \u201cI think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it.\u201d That\u2019s like a car company saying yeah, we installed faulty brakes, but it\u2019s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt.\n\nThe head of the CDC\u2019s food poisoning division responded famously to this kind of blame-the-victim attitude coming from the meat industry. \u201cIs it reasonable that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger, their three-year-old dies?\u201d Is that reasonable?\n\nNot to worry, though: the meat industry is on it. They got the FDA approval for a bacteria-eating virus to spray on the meat. Now, the industry is concerned that consumer acceptance of bacteria-eating viruses may present something of a challenge to the food industry. But if they think that\u2019s going to be a challenge, check out their other bright idea.\n\nThe \u201cEffect of Extracted Housefly Pupae Peptide Mixture on Chilled Pork Preservation\u201d\u2014this is a science-y way of saying they want to smear a maggot mixture on meat.\n\nNow wait\u2014it\u2019s a low-cost and simple method. Think about it; maggots thrive on rotting meat. However, there have been no reports that maggots have any serious diseases; so, they must be packed with some sort of antibacterial something. Have you ever seen a maggot sneeze? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\nSo, they took maggots at three\u00a0days old, washed them, toweled them off, a little Vitamix action, and voil\u00e0! Safer meat.\n\nWe did kidney failure; what about liver failure? We\u2019ve known for decades that a plant-based diet could be used to treat liver failure, significantly reducing the toxins that would otherwise build up eating meat, without a fully functional liver to detoxify your blood.\n\nI do have to admit, though, that some people on plant-based diets have\n\nworsening\n\nliver function. They\u2019re called alcoholics.\u00a0Living on potatoes, corn, grapes, and barley\u2014in fact,\n\nstrictly\n\nplant-based, yet still not doing so hot.\n\nHigh blood pressure is next, affecting nearly 78 million Americans. That\u2019s one in three of us. And as we age, our pressures get higher and higher, such that by age 60, it strikes more than half.\n\nWait a second. If it affects most of us when we get older, maybe it\u2019s less a disease, and more just an inevitable consequence of aging? No. We\u2019ve known since the 1920s that high blood pressure need not occur.\n\nResearchers measured the blood pressures of a thousand people in rural Kenya who ate a diet centered around whole plant foods. Starchy vegetables, whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafies. Our pressures go up as we age; their pressures actually go down.\n\nAnd, the lower the better. The whole 140 over 90 cut-off is arbitrary. \u00a0Even people who start out with blood pressure under 120 over 80 appear to benefit from blood pressure reduction. So, the ideal blood pressure, the no-benefit-from-reducing-it-further blood pressure, is actually 110 over 70. But is it even possible to get blood pressures down to 110 over 70? It\u2019s not just possible; it\u2019s normal\u2014for those eating healthy enough diets.\n\nOver two years at a rural Kenyan hospital, 1,800 patients were admitted. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. Wow! So, they must have had low rates of heart disease. No, they had no rates of heart disease. Not a single case of arteriosclerosis, our #1 killer, was found.\n\nRural China too; about 110 over 70 their entire lives. 70-year-olds had the same average blood pressure as 16-year-olds. Now, of course, Africa and China have vastly different diets, but they share this common theme, that they are plant-based day-to-day, with meat only eaten on special occasions.\n\nWhy do we think it\u2019s the plant-based nature of their diets that was so protective? Because in the Western world, as the American Heart Association has pointed out, the only folks really getting down that low are those eating\u00a0strictly plant-based diets, coming in at an average of\u00a0110 over 65.\n\nBased on the largest study of those eating plant-based diets to date\u201489,000 Californians\u2014there appears to be a stepwise drop in blood pressure\u00a0rates as people eat more and more plant-based.\n\nSame thing with diabetes and obesity. The more and more healthy we eat, the better. Yes, you can wipe out most of your risk eating strictly plant-based, but it\u2019s not black and white, all or nothing. Any movement along the spectrum towards healthier eating can accrue significant benefits.\n\nYou can show this experimentally. You take vegetarians and give them meat, pay them enough to eat it, and their blood pressures go up. Or, you remove meat from their diet, and their blood pressures go down\u2014in just seven\u00a0days! And this is after the vast majority reduced or stopped their blood pressure medications completely. They had to reduce their medications because their pressures were getting so low that if they were on drugs, they could fall over and crack their heads open! \u00a0Lower pressures on fewer drugs; that\u2019s the power of plants.\n\nSo, does the American Heart Association recommend a no-meat diet? No, they recommend a low-meat diet, the so-called DASH diet. Why not vegetarian? When the DASH diet was created, were they just not aware of this landmark research, done by Harvard\u2019s Frank Sacks? No, they were aware of the landmark research. The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Frank Sacks.\n\nSee, the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the #1 goal of capturing the blood pressure-lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet, yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public. They didn\u2019t think the public could handle the truth.\n\nIn their defense, you can see what they were thinking. Just like drugs\n\nnever work\n\nunless you actually take them, diets never work unless you actually eat them. So, you can\u2019t tell people to eat plant-based\u2014they won\u2019t do it. So, they figured they might help more on a population scale if they just soft-pedaled the truth\u00a0to make it more acceptable. Alright,\u00a0tell that to the thousand families\n\na day\n\nthat lose a loved one to high blood pressure. Maybe it\u2019s time to tell the American public the truth.\n\nKiller #14 is Parkinson\u2019s disease. Does a plant-based diet reduce risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease? Well, most studies to date do suggest a link between dairy products and Parkinson\u2019s\u2014but why?\n\nWell, there\u2019s evidence that milk is contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals. High levels of pesticide residues are found in the milk supply, and in the brains of people who die from Parkinson\u2019s disease. And there are other pollutants, like tetrahydroisoquiniline, which is actually what scientists use to try to induce Parkinson\u2019s in primates\u2014and which is found mostly in cheese. So, maybe the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of the milk supply. Good luck with that.\n\nYou could always just not drink it, but then, what would happen to your bones? That\u2019s a marketing ploy; if you look at the actual science, milk does\n\nnot\n\nappear to protect against hip fracture risk, whether drinking during your adult years, or drinking milk during your teen years. If anything, milk consumption was associated with an\n\nincrease\n\nin fracture risk. \u00a0Maybe this is why hip fracture rates are\n\nhighest\n\nin populations with the greatest milk consumption, where they drink the most milk. Swedish researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\n100,000\u00a0men and women followed for up to 20 years, and milk-drinking women had higher rates of death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer, for each daily glass of milk. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of premature death.\n\nAnd they had significantly more bone and hip fractures, too. More milk, more fractures. Milk-drinking men also had higher rates of death. But for some reason, you never see milk ads like this [image of milk carton among gravestones].\n\nFinally, aspiration pneumonia, which is caused by swallowing problems due to Parkinson\u2019s, or Alzheimer\u2019s, or a stroke\u2014all of which we\u2019ve already covered.\n\nSo, where does this leave us? These are the top fifteen reasons that Americans die, and a plant-based diet can help prevent nearly all of them; can help treat more than half of them; and, even, in some cases, even reverse the progression of disease, including our top three killers.\n\nThere are drugs that, in some circumstances, can help, too. You can take one drug to treat cholesterol every day for the rest of your life; another drug for blood sugars; a couple different pills for high blood pressure.\n\nThe\n\nsame\n\ndiet, though, does it all! It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a liver-healthy diet, and a\u00a0heart-healthy diet and a different brain-healthy diet. No, a liver-healthy diet is a heart-healthy diet, is a brain-healthy diet. One diet to rule them all.\n\nAnd what about drug side effects? I\u2019m not talking a little rash or something. Prescription drugs kill more than 100,000\u00a0Americans every year.\n\nWait a second\u2014106,000 deaths a year? That means that the sixth leading cause of death is actually doctors!\n\nThe sixth leading cause of death\u2026 is me! Thankfully, I can be prevented with a plant-based diet.\n\nSeriously, though, compared to 15,000 American vegetarians, meat-eaters had about twice the odds of being on aspirin, sleeping pills, tranquilizers, antacids, painkillers, blood pressure medications, laxatives (of course), and insulin. So, plant-based diets are great for those that don\u2019t like taking drugs, those that don\u2019t like paying for drugs, and for people\u00a0that don\u2019t like risking drug\u00a0side effects.\n\nWant to solve the healthcare crisis? I\u2019ve got a suggestion.\n\nThere is only one diet that\u2019s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients\u2014a plant-based diet. Anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet, ask them one simple question: \u201cHas it been proven to reverse heart disease? You know, the most likely reason you and everyone you love will die?\u201d If the answer is no, why would you even consider it?\n\nIf that\u2019s all a plant-based diet could do\u2014reverse our #1 killer, then shouldn\u2019t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing, treating, and reversing\u00a0other leading killers would seem to make the case for plant-based eating overwhelming.\n\nMost deaths in the United States are preventable, and related to nutrition. According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published, the #1 cause of death in the United States and the #1 cause of disability is our diet, which has since bumped tobacco smoking to killer #2. Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year\u2014whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more.\n\nSo, let me end with a thought experiment. Imagine yourself a smoker, back in the 1950s. The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4,000 cigarettes a year. Think about that. In the 1950s, the\n\naverage\n\nAmerican smoked a half a pack a day.\n\nThe media was telling you to smoke, and famous athletes agreed. Even Santa Claus. I mean, you want to keep fit and stay slender. So, you make sure to smoke and eat hot dogs to keep trim. And eat lots of sugar to stay slim\n\nand trim\n\n. Sugar is a lot better than that apple there, right? \u00a0I mean, sheesh.\n\nAlthough apples do \u201cconnote goodness and freshness,\u201d reads one internal tobacco industry memo, \u201cwhich brings up many possibilities for making youth-oriented cigarettes.\u201d They want to make apple-flavored cigarettes for children. Shameless!\n\n\u201cFor digestion\u2019s sake, you smoke.\u201d I mean, no curative power is claimed for Philip Morris\u2014but, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, better safe than sorry, and smoke.\n\n\u201cBlow in her face and she\u2019ll follow you anywhere.\u201d \u00a0\u201cNo woman ever says no.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cso round, so firm, so fully packed!\u201d\n\nAfter all, John Wayne smoked them, until he got lung cancer and died.\n\nBack then, even the paleo folks were smoking, and so were the doctors.\n\nThis is not to say there wasn\u2019t controversy within the medical profession. Yes, some doctors smoked Camels, but other doctors\u00a0preferred Luckies. So, there was a little conflict there.\n\nThe leader of the U.S. Senate agreed. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to give their throat a vacation? How could there be a single case of throat irritation, when \u201ccigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink?\u201d (Perhaps in Flint, Michigan!)\n\nAnd if you do get irritated? No problem; your doctor can always write you a prescription for cigarettes. This is an ad in\u00a0the\n\nJournal of the American Medical Association\n\n. So, when mainstream medicine is saying that smoking, on balance, is\u00a0good for you, when the American Medical Association is saying that, where could you turn back then if you just wanted the facts? What\u2019s the new data advanced by science? She was \u201ctoo tired for fun\u2026and then she smoked a Camel.\u201d\n\nBabe Ruth spoke of proof positive medical science\u2014that is, when he still could speak, before he died of throat cancer.\n\nNow if, by some miracle, there was a SmokingFacts.org website back then that could deliver the science directly, bypassing commercially corruptible institutional filters, you would have become aware of studies like this. An Adventist study in California published in 1958, that showed that nonsmokers may have at least 90% lower\u00a0lung cancer risk compared to smokers. But this wasn\u2019t the first.\n\nWhen famed surgeon Michael DeBakey was asked why his studies published back in the 30s linking smoking and lung cancer were simply ignored, he had to remind people about what it was like back then. We were a smoking society. It was in the movies; it was everywhere. Medical meetings were one heavy haze of smoke. Smoking was, in a word, normal.\n\nSo, back to our thought experiment: if you\u2019re a smoker in the 50s in the know, what do you do? \u00a0Do you change, or do you wait? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your smoking habit is probably not good for you. So, do you change your smoking habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between puffs, to quit, you could have cancer by then. If you wait until the powers that be officially recognize it, like the Surgeon General did in the subsequent decade, you could be dead by then.\n\nIt took 25 years for the Surgeon General\u2019s report to come out. It took more than 7,000 studies, and the deaths of countless smokers before the first Surgeon General\u2019s report against smoking was finally released in the 1960s. You\u2019d think, maybe, after the first 6,000 studies, they could have given people a little heads up or something? No, it was a powerful industry.\n\nSo, one wonders how many people are currently suffering needlessly from dietary diseases. Maybe we should have stopped smoking after the\n\n700th\n\nstudy like this came out.\n\nAs a smoker in the 50s, on one hand, you had all of society, the government, the medical profession itself telling you to smoke. And, on the other hand, all you had was the science\u2014if you were even lucky enough to be aware\u00a0of studies like this.\n\nNow fast forward, 55\u00a0years. There\u2019s a new Adventist study out of California, warning America about the risks of something else they may be putting in their mouths. And it\u2019s not just one study. According to the latest review, the total sum of evidence suggests that mortality from all causes put together, and many of our dreaded diseases\u2014heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes\u2014is significantly lower in those eating plant-based.\n\nSo, instead of someone going along with America\u2019s smoking habits in the 50s, imagine you, or someone you know, going along with America\u2019s\n\neating\n\nhabits today. What do you do? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your eating habits are probably not so good for you. So, do you change your eating habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between bites, to change your diet, it may be too late.\n\nIn fact, even after the Surgeon General\u2019s report was released, the medical community still dragged their feet. The AMA actually went on record refusing to endorse the Surgeon General\u2019s report. Why? Could that have been because they had just been handed $10 million from the tobacco industry? Maybe not;\u00a0maybe it\u2019s coincidence.\n\nSo, we know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry\u2014but why weren\u2019t individual doctors speaking out? Well, there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time, writing in, as there are today, standing up against industries killing millions. But why not more? Maybe it\u2019s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes, just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemic of dietary diseases. What was the AMA\u2019s rallying cry back then? Everything in moderation. \u201cExtensive scientific studies have proved that smoking in moderation\u201d is okay. Sound familiar?\n\nToday, the food industry uses the same tobacco industry tactics\u2014supplying misinformation, twisting the science.\n\nThe same scientists-for-hire paid to downplay the risks of secondhand smoke and toxic chemicals are the same paid\u00a0by the National Confectioners Association to downplay the risks of candy, and the same hired by the meat industry to downplay the risks of meat.\n\nConsumption of animal products and processed foods causes at least 14 million deaths around the world every\u00a0year. 14 million people dead every year. Plant-based diets can\u00a0now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking.\n\nHow many more people have to die, though, before the CDC encourages people not to wait for open-heart surgery to start eating healthy as well?\n\nUntil the system changes, we need\u00a0to take personal responsibility for our own health, and for our family\u2019s health. We can\u2019t wait until society catches up to the science, because it\u2019s a matter of life and death.\n\nLast year, Dr. Kim Williams became President of the American College of Cardiology. He was asked why he follows his own advice that he gives to patients, to eat a plant-based diet. \u201cI don\u2019t mind dying,\u201d Dr. Williams replied. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be my own fault.\u201d\n\nThank you very much.\n\nTo see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr.\u00a0Greger may be referring, watch the above video.

This is a picture of me, right around the time that my grandma was diagnosed with end-stage heart disease and sent home to die. She had already had so many bypass operations, basically ran out of plumbing at some point, confined to a wheelchair, and there was nothing more they could do. \u00a0Her life was over at age 65. But then, she heard about this guy, Nathan Pritikin, one of our early lifestyle medicine pioneers.\n\nAnd what happened next is chronicled in Pritikin\u2019s biography. My grandma was one of the \u201cdeath\u2019s door\u201d people. Frances Greger arrived in a wheelchair. \u201cMrs. Greger had heart disease, angina, and claudication; her condition was so bad she could no longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs. \u00a0Within three weeks, though she was not only out of her wheelchair but was walking ten miles a day.\u201d\n\nThis is my grandma at her grandson\u2019s wedding 15 years after she was given her medical death sentence, and thanks to a healthy diet, she was able to live\u00a0another 31 years on this earth\u2014until 96\u2014to enjoy her six grandkids, including me.\n\nThat is why I went into medicine.\n\nWhen Dr. Ornish published his Lifestyle Heart Trial years later, proving with quantitative angiography that coronary artery\u00a0disease could indeed be reversed in the majority of patients without drugs or surgery\u2014just a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle changes, I assumed that it was going to be a game-changer. My family had seen it with their own eyes, but finally here it was in black and white, published in one of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals on the planet. But, nothing happened\u2014 leaving me to wonder if, effectively, the cure to our #1\u00a0killer could get lost down some rabbit hole and ignored, then, what else might be in the medical literature that can help my patients? I made it my life\u2019s mission to find out.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with my work, every year I read through every issue of every English-language nutrition journal in the world\u2014so busy folks like you don\u2019t have to.\n\nI then compile all the most interesting, the most groundbreaking, the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day to\u00a0my nonprofit site, NutritionFacts.org.\n\nEverything on the website is free. There are no ads, no corporate sponsorships. It\u2019s strictly noncommercial, not selling anything. I just put it up as a public service, as a labor of love.\n\nNew videos and articles\n\nevery day\n\n, on the latest in\n\nevidence-based\n\nnutrition. What a concept!\n\nWhere did Pritikin get his evidence from? A network of missionary hospitals set up by Western doctors throughout sub-Saharan Africa uncovered what may be one of the most important advances in health, according to one of our\u00a0most famous medical figures of the 20th century, Dr. Denis Burkitt: the fact that many of the most common and major diseases \u201cin modern Western culture are universally rare in third world communities.\u201d\n\nLike, heart disease. This landmark article from the 50s started out with a shocking statement: \u201cIn the African population of Uganda, coronary heart disease is almost non-existent.\u201d Wait a second, our #1 cause of death, almost nonexistent? What were they eating?\n\nThey were eating a lot of starchy vegetables, starchy grains, and greens, and their protein almost exclusively\u00a0from plant sources, and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it. Actually, very similar to those eating modern-day, plant-based diets.\n\nMaybe the Africans were just dying early from some\u00a0other kind of diseases\u2014and so, never lived long enough to have a heart attack? No, here are\n\nage-matched\n\nheart attack rates in Uganda versus St. Louis. Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda, only one myocardial infarction. Out of 632 age- and gender-matched autopsies in Missouri, 136 myocardial infarctions: more than 100 times the rate of our #1 killer.\n\nIn fact, they were so blown away they went back and did another 800 autopsies in Uganda, and still, just that one small healed infarct (meaning it wasn\u2019t even the cause of death) out of 1,427 patients\u2014less than one in a thousand; whereas here, heart disease is an epidemic.\n\nThis is a list of diseases commonly found in the U.S. (and in populations that eat and live like the U.S.), but are rare or even nonexistent in populations centering their diets around\n\nwhole plant foods\n\n.\n\nThese are among our most\n\ncommon\n\ndiseases, like obesity, for example, or hiatal hernia, one of the most common stomach problems. Varicose veins and hemorrhoids\u2014two of the most common venous problems; colorectal cancer\u2014a leading cause of cancer-related death; diverticulitis\u2014the #1 disease of the intestines; appendicitis\u2014the #1 cause of\u00a0emergency abdominal surgery; gallbladder disease\u2014the #1 cause of\n\nnonemergency\n\nabdominal surgery; as well as\u00a0ischemic heart disease\u2014the\n\ncommonest cause of death\n\nhere, but a rarity among plant-based populations.\n\nThis suggests heart disease may be a\n\nchoice\n\n. Like cavities. If you look at the teeth of people who lived over 10,000 years before the invention of the toothbrush, they pretty much had no cavities. Didn\u2019t brush a day in their lives; no flossing; yet, no cavities. That\u2019s because candy bars hadn\u2019t been invented yet.\n\nWhy do people continue to get cavities when we know they\u2019re preventable through diet? Simple. Because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist\u2019s chair for many people. And, that\u2019s fine!\n\nLook, as long as people understand the consequences of their actions, as a physician, what more can I do? If you\u2019re an adult, and decide the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family, then, go for it\u2014I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence (I\u2019ve got a good dental plan).\n\nBut, what if instead of the plaque on our teeth, we\u2019re talking about the plaque building up inside of our arteries? This is another disease that can be prevented by changing our diet.\n\nNow, what are the consequences for you and your family? Now, we\u2019re not talking about scraping tartar anymore. Now, we\u2019re talking life and death. The most likely reason that most of our loved ones will die is because of heart disease. It\u2019s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live\u2014but we should make these\u00a0choices consciously, educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions.\n\nCoronary heart disease; atherosclerosis; hardening of the arteries, begins in\n\nchildhood\n\n.\n\nBy age 10, the arteries of nearly all kids raised on the standard American diet already have fatty streaks\u2014the first stage of the disease.\n\nThen, these plaques start forming in our 20s, get worse in our 30s, and then, can start killing us off. In our hearts, it\u2019s called a heart attack; in our brains, the same disease is\u00a0called a stroke.\n\nIf there is\n\nanyone\n\nin this audience older than age 10, then the question\u00a0isn\u2019t whether or not to eat healthy to\n\nprevent\n\nheart disease; it\u2019s whether you want to\n\nreverse\n\nthe heart disease that you already have.\n\nIs that even possible? When researchers took people with heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by those populations that didn\u2019t suffer from heart disease, their hope was to slow the disease process down\u2014maybe even stop it. But instead, something miraculous happened.\n\nThe disease started to reverse, to get better. As soon as patients stopped eating an artery-clogging diet, their arteries started opening up. \u00a0Their bodies were able to start dissolving some of the plaque away. Even in some cases of severe triple vessel heart disease, arteries opened up without drugs, without surgery\u2014suggesting their bodies wanted to heal all along, but were just never given the chance. This improvement in blood flow to the heart is after just three weeks of eating healthy.\n\nLet me share with you the best-kept secret in medicine. The best-kept secret in medicine is that sometimes, given the right conditions, our\u00a0body can heal itself.\n\nIf you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get all red, hot, swollen, and inflamed, but will heal naturally if we just stand back and let our body work its magic. But what if we\n\nkept\n\nwhacking it in the same place three times a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) every day? It\u2019d never heal.\n\nYou\u2019d go to your doctor and say, \u201cMy shin hurts.\u201d And the doctor would be like, no problem, whip out their pad, and write you a prescription for painkillers. You\u2019re still whacking your shin three times a day, but it feels so much better with the pain pills on board. Thank heavens for modern medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s like when taking\u00a0nitroglycerine for crushing chest pain. Tremendous relief, but you\u2019re not actually treating the underlying cause of the disease.\n\nOur body wants to come back to health, if we let it. But if we keep re-injuring it three times a day, we may never heal.\n\nIt\u2019s like smoking. One of the most\n\namazing\n\nthings I learned in medical school was that within about 15 years of stopping smoking, our lung cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Our lungs can clear out all that tar, and eventually, it\u2019s almost as if\u00a0we never started smoking at all.\n\nEvery morning of our smoking life, that healing process started until, wham, our first cigarette of the day, re-injuring our lungs with every puff. Just like we can re-injure our arteries with every bite, when all we had to do all along\u2014the miracle cure, was to just stand back, get out of the way, stop re-damaging ourselves, and let our bodies\u2019 natural healing processes bring us back towards health.\n\nSure, you could choose moderation, and hit yourself with a smaller hammer. But why beat yourself up at all?\n\nThe human body is a self-healing machine.\n\nWe\u2019ve known about this for decades.\n\nAmerican Heart Journal\n\n, 1977: cases like Mr. F.W. here; such severe angina he couldn\u2019t even make it to the mailbox, but then started eating healthier, and a few months later, he was climbing mountains, no pain.\n\nThere are some fancy new anti-angina drugs on the market now that cost thousands of dollars a year. But at the highest dose, they can successfully prolong exercise duration, extending the time someone can walk on a treadmill as long as 33\u00a01/2\u00a0seconds.\n\nIt does not look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.\n\nYou see, plant-based diets aren\u2019t just safer and cheaper, but they\u00a0can work\n\nbetter\n\n.\n\nKiller #2\u00a0is cancer. What happens if we put cancer on a plant-based diet? Dean Ornish and colleagues found that the progression of prostate cancer could be reversed with a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle behaviors\u2014and no wonder.\n\nIf you drip the blood of those eating the standard American diet onto cancer cells growing in a petri dish, cancer growth is cut down by about 9%. But put people on a plant-based diet for a year, though, and their blood can do this. The blood circulating within the bodies of those eating\u00a0plant-based diets has nearly eight\u00a0times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth.\n\nNow, this was for prostate cancer\u2014the leading cancer killer specific to men. In women, it\u2019s breast cancer. So, researchers tried duplicating the study with women, using breast cancer cells instead. They didn\u2019t want to wait a whole year to get the results, though. So, they figured they\u2019d see what a healthy diet could do in just two weeks, against three different types of human breast cancer cells.\n\nThis was the before: cancer growth powering away at 100%. And then, after eating a plant-based diet for 14 days.\n\nHere\u2019s the before picture: a layer of breast cancer cells is laid down in a petri dish, and then blood from women eating the standard American diet is dripped on them. And as you can see, even people eating crappy diets have some ability to break down cancer. But after just two\u00a0weeks eating healthy, blood was drawn from those same women\u2014so, they acted as their own controls\u2014dripped on another carpet of breast cancer cells, and this is what they were left with; just a few individual cancer cells left. Their bodies just cleaned up.\n\nBefore, and after; just two weeks eating healthy. Their blood became that much more hostile to cancer.\n\nSlowing down the growth of cancer cells is nice, but getting rid of them is even better. This is what\u2019s called apoptosis, programmed cell death. After eating healthy, their own bodies were able to reprogram the cancer cells, forcing them into early retirement.\n\nThis is what\u2019s called TUNEL imaging, measuring\u00a0DNA fragmentation or cell death. Dying cells show up as white spots. So, again, this is the before\u2014what the blood of the average woman eating a standard American diet can do to breast cancer cells. Her blood may be able to kill off a few. But then, after 14 days of healthy plant-based living, her blood can do this. It\u2019s like she\u2019s an entirely different person inside.\n\nThe same blood that was now coursing through these women\u2019s bodies gained the power to significantly slow down and stop breast cancer cell growth, within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\nof eating a plant-based diet.\n\nWhat kind of blood do we want in our body; what kind of immune system? Do we want blood that just kind of rolls over when new cancer cells pop up, or do we want blood circulating to every nook and cranny of our body with the power to slow down and stop them?\n\nNow, this dramatic strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plant-based diet\n\nand\n\nexercise; they had these women\u00a0out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day. Well, wait a second, if you do two things, how do you know what role the diet played? So, the researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\nThis is measuring cancer cell clearance. This is what we saw before; the effect of blood taken from those who ate a plant-based diet\u2014in this case for an average of 14 years\u2014along with mild exercise, like just walking every day. Plant-based diet and walking\u2014that\u2019s the kind of cancer cell clearance you get. Compare that to the cancer-stopping power of your average sedentary meat-eater, which is basically nonexistent.\n\nThis middle group is interesting, though. Instead of 14 years on a plant-based diet, ate 14 years of a standard American diet\u2014\n\nbut\n\n, had 14 years of daily, strenuous, hour-long exercise, like calisthenics.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if you exercise long enough, if you exercise hard enough, can you rival some strolling plant-eaters?\n\nAnd the answer is, exercise helped\u2014no question, but literally 5,000 hours in the gym was no match for a plant-based diet.\n\nSame thing as before. Even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes, your body\u2019s not totally defenseless. Your bloodstream can kill off a few cancer cells. But here\u2019s the hard core strenuous exercise group, killing off cancer cells left and right.\n\nBut nothing appears to kick more cancer tush than a plant-based diet.\n\nWe think it\u2019s because of the animal proteins\u2014meat, egg white, and dairy proteins\u2014increasing the level of IGF-1 in our bodies. Insulin-like growth factor-1, a cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in the acquisition and progression of malignant tumors.\n\nBut if we lower animal protein intake, if you put people on a plant-based diet, their IGF-1 levels go down, and if you put people\u00a0on a plant-based diet for years, their levels drop even further.\n\nAnd their IGF-1\n\nbinding protein\n\nlevels go up. That\u2019s one way our body tries to protect itself from cancer\u2014from excessive growth\u2014by releasing a binding protein into our bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF-1. It\u2019s like our body\u2019s emergency brake. Yes, in as little as two\u00a0weeks, a plant-based diet can bring down your liver\u2019s production of IGF-1 . But what about all the IGF-1 circulating in your bloodstream from the bacon and eggs you had three weeks before? So, your liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to take it out of circulation. And, as you can see, it just gets better and better, the longer you eat healthy.\n\nHere\u2019s the experiment that nailed IGF-1 as the villain; same as last time. Go on a plant-based diet, cancer cell growth drops, and cancer cell death shoots up. But then, here\u2019s the kicker: what if you added back to the cancer the exact same amount of IGF-1 banished from your system just\u00a0because you were eating healthy for two weeks? It erases the diet and exercise effect. It\u2019s like you never started eating healthy at all.\n\nSo, the reason the largest prospective study on diet and cancer ever found that the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meat-eaters may be because they eat less animal protein. So, they end up with less IGF-1, which can mean less cancer growth.\n\nHow much less cancer are we talking about? Middle-aged men and women with high protein intakes had a 75% increase in total\u00a0mortality, and a four\n\n\u2013\n\nfold\u00a0increase in the risk of dying from cancer. But not all proteins; specifically animal protein, which makes sense, of course, given the higher IGF-1 levels.\n\nThe academic institution sent out a press release with a memorable opening line: \u201cThat chicken wing you\u2019re eating could be as deadly as a cigarette,\u201d explaining that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer\u2014\u201da mortality risk factor comparable to smoking.\u201d\n\nWhat was the response to the revelation that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking? One nutrition scientist replied that it was potentially dangerous to compare the effects of smoking with the effect of meat and cheese. Why? Because a smoker might think, \u201cWhy bother quitting smoking if my ham\u00a0and cheese\u00a0sandwich is just as bad for me?\u201d So, better not to tell anyone about the whole meat and dairy thing.\n\nThat reminds me of a famous Philip Morris cigarette ad that tried to downplay the risks by saying, \u201cYou think secondhand smoke is bad, increasing the risk of lung cancer 19%? Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of milk every day may be three times as bad\u201462% increased\u00a0risk of lung cancer.\u201d Or doubling the risk by frequently cooking with oil, or tripling your risk of heart disease by eating non-vegetarian, or multiplying your risk six-fold by eating lots of meat and dairy. So, they conclude, \u201cLet\u2019s keep a sense of\n\nperspective\n\nhere.\u201d The risk of lung cancer from secondhand smoke may be \u201cwell below the risk reported for other everyday activities.\u201d So, breathe deep.\n\nThat\u2019s like saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about getting stabbed, because getting shot is so much worse.\u201d\n\nUh, how about neither? Two risks don\u2019t make a right.\n\nYou\u2019ll note Philip Morris stopped throwing dairy under the bus when they purchased Kraft Foods.\n\nOkay, what about the other\u00a013 leading causes of death?\n\nThe top three killers used to be heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Oh, that is\n\nso\n\n2007. Now, it\u2019s heart disease, cancer, and COPD\u2014chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, like emphysema. Thankfully, COPD can be prevented with the help of a plant-based diet, and even treated with plants; improving lung function over time.\n\nOf course, the tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently. Instead of adding plants to one\u2019s\n\ndiet\n\nto help one\u2019s lung function, wouldn\u2019t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes? And indeed, the addition of a\u00e7a\u00ed berries to cigarettes evidently has a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice. Who would have thunk it?\n\nNext, they\u2019re going to be putting berries in meat. And indeed, I couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. The addition of\u00a0fruit extracts to burgers was not without its glitches, though. The blackberries \u201cliterally dyed burger patties with a distinct purplish colour\u201d\u2014though, evidently, infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in does evidently improve tenderness. And, it\u2019s even possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurters with powdered grape seeds, though, there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product. And if there\u2019s one thing we know about hot dog-eaters, it\u2019s that they\u2019re picky about what goes in their food.\n\nPig anus? Okay, but grape seeds? Eww!\n\nStrokes are killer #4. Preventing strokes may be all about eating potassium-rich foods, yet most Americans don\u2019t even reach the recommended\n\nminimum\n\ndaily intake. And by most, I mean more than 98%. 98% of us eat potassium-deficient diets, because 98% of us don\u2019t eat enough plants.\n\nPotassium comes from the words pot ash. You take any plant, put it in a pot, and reduce it to ash, and you\u2019re left with pot-ash-ium, so-called vegetable alkali. True story, but can anyone name me a plant food particularly high in potassium?\n\nBananas, right? I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s like the one thing everyone knows about nutrition. Chiquita must have had a great PR firm or something. But it turns out that bananas don\u2019t even make the top 50 sources, coming in at number 86, right behind fast food vanilla milk shakes. It goes fast food vanilla milk shakes,\n\nthen\n\nbananas.\n\nIn fact, when I was researching for my new book, I found out that the USDA expanded their list, and now bananas don\u2019t even make the top\n\nthousand\n\nsources\n\n;\n\ncoming in at number 1,611, right after Reese\u2019s Pieces. I kid you not. The most concentrated whole food sources of potassium in the diet are: beans, and greens, and dates.\n\nBananas don\u2019t make it to a thousand\u2014in fact, if you look at the next leading cause of death (unintentional injuries), bananas could be downright dangerous.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is now our sixth leading killer, now striking\u00a0a staggering four\u00a0million Americans affected. Twenty\u00a0years ago, it wasn\u2019t even in the top ten. According to the latest dietary guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s, the two most important things we can do: cut down our consumption of meat, dairy, and junk; and replace those\u00a0with vegetables, beans, fruits, and whole grains.\n\nThis is based, in part, on data going back over 20\u00a0years now. Those who eat meat\u2014red meat or white meat, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014appear between two\u00a0to three\u00a0times more likely to become demented later in life, compared to those that don\u2019t eat meat. And the longer one eats meat-free, the lower the risk of dementia drops.\n\nNext on the list: type 2 diabetes, which we can prevent, arrest, and reverse with a plant-based diet\u2014something we\u2019ve known since back in the 1930s. Within five\u00a0years, about a quarter of the diabetics were able to get off insulin.\n\nBut plant-based diets are low-calorie diets. Maybe their diabetes just got better because they lost so much weight? To tease that out, what we would need is a study where researchers switch people to a healthy diet, but force them to eat so much food that they wouldn\u2019t\u00a0lose any weight, despite eating healthier. Then, we could see if plant-based diet had unique benefits beyond all the weight loss. We\u2019d have to wait 44 years, but here it is: subjects were weighed every day, and if they started losing weight, they were made to eat more food. In fact, so much food, some of the participants had problems\u00a0eating it all\u2014like \u201cnot another tostada, not another salad.\u201d But they eventually adapted; so, there was no significant alteration in body weight, despite restricting meat, dairy, eggs, and junk.\n\nSo, with zero weight loss, did a plant-based diet still help? Overall, insulin requirements were cut about 60%, and half were able to get off insulin altogether despite no change in weight. How many years did this\u00a0take? No, 16\n\ndays\n\n.\n\nSo, we\u2019re talking diabetics who\u2019ve had diabetes for as long as 20\u00a0years, injecting 20 units of insulin a day. And then, as few as 13 days later, they\u2019re off of all insulin altogether, thanks to less than two weeks on a plant-based diet\u2014even with zero weight loss. Diabetes for 20 years, then off all insulin in two\u00a0weeks. Diabetes for 20 years, because no one had told them about a plant-based diet. Here\u2019s patient 15; 32 units of insulin on the control diet, and then, 18 days later, on none. Lower blood sugars on 32 units\n\nless\n\ninsulin. That\u2019s the power of plants. This was without weight loss; his body just started working that much better.\n\nAnd as a bonus, their cholesterol dropped like a rock to under 150, in just 16 days. Just like moderate changes in diet usually result in only modest reductions in cholesterol, how moderate do you want your diabetes?\n\nEverything in moderation may be a truer statement than many people realize. Moderate changes in diet can leave diabetics with moderate vision loss, moderate kidney failure, and moderate amputations\u2014maybe just a few\u00a0toes or something? Moderation in all things is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nThat study that purported to show that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking supposedly suggested that people who eat lots of animal protein are four times as likely to die from cancer or diabetes. But if you look at the actual study, you\u2019ll see that\u2019s not true. Those eating lots of animal protein didn\u2019t have just four\u00a0times more risk of dying from diabetes;\n\nthey had 73 times higher risk of dying from diabetes.\n\nThose who chose moderation\u2014eating a moderate amount of animal protein\u2014only had 23 times the risk of death from diabetes.\n\nKiller #8 is kidney failure, which may be both prevented and treated with a plant-based diet. And no surprise; kidneys are highly vascular organs. Harvard researchers found three dietary risk factors for declining kidney function: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. Animal fat can alter the actual structure of our kidneys, based on studies like this, showing plugs of fat literally clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys.\n\nAnd the animal\n\nprotein\n\ncan have a profound effect on normal kidney function, inducing what\u2019s called hyperfiltration; increasing the workload on the kidney, but not plant protein. Eat some\u00a0tuna fish, and you can see increased pressure on the kidneys one, two, and three\u00a0hours after the meal; shoots right up. If, instead of having a tuna salad sandwich, though, you\u00a0had a\n\ntofu\n\nsalad sandwich with the same amount of protein, no effect. Kidneys can deal with plant protein\u00a0without even batting an eyelash.\n\nWhy does\n\nanimal\n\nprotein cause the overload reaction, but not plant protein? It appears to be due to inflammation triggered by the animal protein. We know this because if you give a powerful anti-inflammatory drug along with the tuna fish, you can actually abolish that hyperfiltration effect, that protein leakage effect in response to meat ingestion.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the acid load. Animal protein induces the formation of acid within the kidney, which may lead to tubular toxicity: damage to the delicate urine-making tubes within the kidney. Animal foods tend to be acid-forming, whereas plant foods tend to either be relatively neutral or actually alkaline,\n\nbase\n\n-forming, to counteract some of that acid. So, the solution to halting the progression of chronic kidney disease might lie\u00a0in the produce aisle\u00a0rather than the pharmacy aisle.\n\nNo wonder plant-based diets have been used to\n\ntreat\n\nkidney disease for decades. Here\u2019s protein leakage on the low-sodium diet that physicians would conventionally put these patients on; switched to a supplemented vegan diet; conventional; plant-based; conventional; plant-based\u2014turning kidney dysfunction on and off like a light switch, based on what\u2019s going into their mouths.\n\nKiller #9 is respiratory infections. What possible role could diet play? You obviously haven\u2019t seen my video\n\nKale and the Immune System\n\n, talking about the immunostimulatory effects of kale. Is there anything kale cannot do?\n\nBoosting antibody production seven-fold; but that\u2019s in a petri dish. What about in people? Older men and women were split into two groups right before they were going to get their Pneumovax vaccination (their pneumonia vaccination). Half continued to eat as they always had. The other half added just a few servings of fruits and vegetables to their daily diet, and after getting their injection, you can see a significant improvement in the protective antibody immune response from that one simple change. That wasn\u2019t cutting out meat; just adding fruits and vegetables can significantly improve immune function.\n\nKiller #10 is suicide. We\u2019ve known those eating healthier have healthier mood states\u2014in fact, only about half the depression, anxiety, and stress scores compared to those that eat meat. Researchers suspect it\u2019s the arachidonic acid, this\u00a0inflammatory long chain omega-6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs. That\u2019s where it\u2019s predominantly found in the American diet. But you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s cause and effect, until you put it to the test.\n\nThey took people eating the standard American diet, and removed meat, fish, poultry, and eggs from their diets, and got a significant improvement in mood scores within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\n. Thanks, perhaps, to the removal of arachidonic acid from their bodies, which they thought may be adversely impacting mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation; brain inflammation, but we\u00a0could bring that down\u00a0within a matter of weeks after cutting eggs, chicken, and other meat.\n\nNow, am I just cherry picking, though? What about all the randomized controlled trials like that, showing that\n\nother\n\ndiets have improved mood?\n\nThere aren\u2019t any.\n\nA recent review concluded that\n\nonly\n\nthe plant-based study fit the bill. It\u2019s hard to cherry pick when there\u2019s only one cherry.\n\nWorks in a workplace setting too: significant increases in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health\u2014not surprisingly, translating into improved work productivity. The biggest such study, across 15 corporate sites at Geico, found that plant-based diets resulted in significant reported improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and emotional well-being. So, lifestyle interventions, such as exercise, can help\n\nmental\n\nas well as physical health. And among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets.\n\nKiller #11 is blood infections. Sure, foodborne bacteria can kind of burrow through the bloodstream and directly invade through the intestinal wall\u2014but in women, may creep up into their bladder.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for decades that it\u2019s bacteria creeping up from the rectum that cause bladder infections. But only recently did we figure out where that rectal reservoir of bladder-infecting\n\nE. coli\n\nwas coming from: chicken. We now have DNA fingerprinting proof of a direct link between farm animals, meat, and bladder infections\u2014solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis, bladder infections as an animal-to-human disease.\n\nWait a second. Can\u2019t I\u00a0just use a meat thermometer and cook the meat through? No, because of cross-contamination. We\u2019ve known for decades that if you give someone a frozen chicken to prepare and cook in their own kitchen as they normally would, a multitude of antibiotic-resistant\n\nE. coli\n\njump from the chicken into the gut of the volunteer \u2014before they even eat it! So, you could incinerate it to ash; you don\u2019t even have to eat any of it. And it still wouldn\u2019t matter, because you already infected yourself just handling it.\n\nWithin days, the drug-resistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person\u2019s gut flora. The chicken bacteria were like taking over their intestines.\n\nEven if you follow all the safe handling guidelines, rinsing everything with bleach\u2014even spraying bleach on for good measure, there still may be pathogenic fecal bacteria left behind. No one actually does this, but what if you did this, and then came in later and swabbed kitchen surfaces? Researchers found pathogenic fecal bacteria: salmonella, campylobacter\u2014both serious human pathogens, still left behind in the kitchen. The reason that most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen sink than on their toilet seat is because most people rinse chickens in the sink, not the toilet. So, unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab, the only way to guarantee we\u2019re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into our homes in the first place.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s not like you eat chicken once, and you\u2019re colonized for life. In this study, the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about ten\u00a0days before our good bacteria were able to muscle them out of the way. The problem is that most families eat chicken more than once every ten days; so, they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems.\n\nBut wait a second. You can\u2019t sell unsafe cars; you can\u2019t sell unsafe toys; how is it legal to sell unsafe meat?\n\nThey do it by blaming the consumer. As one USDA poultry microbiologist said: \u201cRaw meats are not idiot-proof. They can be mishandled and when they are, it\u2019s like handling a hand grenade. If you pull the pin, somebody\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d See, if we get sick, it\u2019s our fault.\n\nWhile some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in supermarkets, the USDA poultry expert disagrees. \u201cI think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it.\u201d That\u2019s like a car company saying yeah, we installed faulty brakes, but it\u2019s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt.\n\nThe head of the CDC\u2019s food poisoning division responded famously to this kind of blame-the-victim attitude coming from the meat industry. \u201cIs it reasonable that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger, their three-year-old dies?\u201d Is that reasonable?\n\nNot to worry, though: the meat industry is on it. They got the FDA approval for a bacteria-eating virus to spray on the meat. Now, the industry is concerned that consumer acceptance of bacteria-eating viruses may present something of a challenge to the food industry. But if they think that\u2019s going to be a challenge, check out their other bright idea.\n\nThe \u201cEffect of Extracted Housefly Pupae Peptide Mixture on Chilled Pork Preservation\u201d\u2014this is a science-y way of saying they want to smear a maggot mixture on meat.\n\nNow wait\u2014it\u2019s a low-cost and simple method. Think about it; maggots thrive on rotting meat. However, there have been no reports that maggots have any serious diseases; so, they must be packed with some sort of antibacterial something. Have you ever seen a maggot sneeze? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\nSo, they took maggots at three\u00a0days old, washed them, toweled them off, a little Vitamix action, and voil\u00e0! Safer meat.\n\nWe did kidney failure; what about liver failure? We\u2019ve known for decades that a plant-based diet could be used to treat liver failure, significantly reducing the toxins that would otherwise build up eating meat, without a fully functional liver to detoxify your blood.\n\nI do have to admit, though, that some people on plant-based diets have\n\nworsening\n\nliver function. They\u2019re called alcoholics.\u00a0Living on potatoes, corn, grapes, and barley\u2014in fact,\n\nstrictly\n\nplant-based, yet still not doing so hot.\n\nHigh blood pressure is next, affecting nearly 78 million Americans. That\u2019s one in three of us. And as we age, our pressures get higher and higher, such that by age 60, it strikes more than half.\n\nWait a second. If it affects most of us when we get older, maybe it\u2019s less a disease, and more just an inevitable consequence of aging? No. We\u2019ve known since the 1920s that high blood pressure need not occur.\n\nResearchers measured the blood pressures of a thousand people in rural Kenya who ate a diet centered around whole plant foods. Starchy vegetables, whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafies. Our pressures go up as we age; their pressures actually go down.\n\nAnd, the lower the better. The whole 140 over 90 cut-off is arbitrary. \u00a0Even people who start out with blood pressure under 120 over 80 appear to benefit from blood pressure reduction. So, the ideal blood pressure, the no-benefit-from-reducing-it-further blood pressure, is actually 110 over 70. But is it even possible to get blood pressures down to 110 over 70? It\u2019s not just possible; it\u2019s normal\u2014for those eating healthy enough diets.\n\nOver two years at a rural Kenyan hospital, 1,800 patients were admitted. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. Wow! So, they must have had low rates of heart disease. No, they had no rates of heart disease. Not a single case of arteriosclerosis, our #1 killer, was found.\n\nRural China too; about 110 over 70 their entire lives. 70-year-olds had the same average blood pressure as 16-year-olds. Now, of course, Africa and China have vastly different diets, but they share this common theme, that they are plant-based day-to-day, with meat only eaten on special occasions.\n\nWhy do we think it\u2019s the plant-based nature of their diets that was so protective? Because in the Western world, as the American Heart Association has pointed out, the only folks really getting down that low are those eating\u00a0strictly plant-based diets, coming in at an average of\u00a0110 over 65.\n\nBased on the largest study of those eating plant-based diets to date\u201489,000 Californians\u2014there appears to be a stepwise drop in blood pressure\u00a0rates as people eat more and more plant-based.\n\nSame thing with diabetes and obesity. The more and more healthy we eat, the better. Yes, you can wipe out most of your risk eating strictly plant-based, but it\u2019s not black and white, all or nothing. Any movement along the spectrum towards healthier eating can accrue significant benefits.\n\nYou can show this experimentally. You take vegetarians and give them meat, pay them enough to eat it, and their blood pressures go up. Or, you remove meat from their diet, and their blood pressures go down\u2014in just seven\u00a0days! And this is after the vast majority reduced or stopped their blood pressure medications completely. They had to reduce their medications because their pressures were getting so low that if they were on drugs, they could fall over and crack their heads open! \u00a0Lower pressures on fewer drugs; that\u2019s the power of plants.\n\nSo, does the American Heart Association recommend a no-meat diet? No, they recommend a low-meat diet, the so-called DASH diet. Why not vegetarian? When the DASH diet was created, were they just not aware of this landmark research, done by Harvard\u2019s Frank Sacks? No, they were aware of the landmark research. The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Frank Sacks.\n\nSee, the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the #1 goal of capturing the blood pressure-lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet, yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public. They didn\u2019t think the public could handle the truth.\n\nIn their defense, you can see what they were thinking. Just like drugs\n\nnever work\n\nunless you actually take them, diets never work unless you actually eat them. So, you can\u2019t tell people to eat plant-based\u2014they won\u2019t do it. So, they figured they might help more on a population scale if they just soft-pedaled the truth\u00a0to make it more acceptable. Alright,\u00a0tell that to the thousand families\n\na day\n\nthat lose a loved one to high blood pressure. Maybe it\u2019s time to tell the American public the truth.\n\nKiller #14 is Parkinson\u2019s disease. Does a plant-based diet reduce risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease? Well, most studies to date do suggest a link between dairy products and Parkinson\u2019s\u2014but why?\n\nWell, there\u2019s evidence that milk is contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals. High levels of pesticide residues are found in the milk supply, and in the brains of people who die from Parkinson\u2019s disease. And there are other pollutants, like tetrahydroisoquiniline, which is actually what scientists use to try to induce Parkinson\u2019s in primates\u2014and which is found mostly in cheese. So, maybe the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of the milk supply. Good luck with that.\n\nYou could always just not drink it, but then, what would happen to your bones? That\u2019s a marketing ploy; if you look at the actual science, milk does\n\nnot\n\nappear to protect against hip fracture risk, whether drinking during your adult years, or drinking milk during your teen years. If anything, milk consumption was associated with an\n\nincrease\n\nin fracture risk. \u00a0Maybe this is why hip fracture rates are\n\nhighest\n\nin populations with the greatest milk consumption, where they drink the most milk. Swedish researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\n100,000\u00a0men and women followed for up to 20 years, and milk-drinking women had higher rates of death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer, for each daily glass of milk. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of premature death.\n\nAnd they had significantly more bone and hip fractures, too. More milk, more fractures. Milk-drinking men also had higher rates of death. But for some reason, you never see milk ads like this [image of milk carton among gravestones].\n\nFinally, aspiration pneumonia, which is caused by swallowing problems due to Parkinson\u2019s, or Alzheimer\u2019s, or a stroke\u2014all of which we\u2019ve already covered.\n\nSo, where does this leave us? These are the top fifteen reasons that Americans die, and a plant-based diet can help prevent nearly all of them; can help treat more than half of them; and, even, in some cases, even reverse the progression of disease, including our top three killers.\n\nThere are drugs that, in some circumstances, can help, too. You can take one drug to treat cholesterol every day for the rest of your life; another drug for blood sugars; a couple different pills for high blood pressure.\n\nThe\n\nsame\n\ndiet, though, does it all! It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a liver-healthy diet, and a\u00a0heart-healthy diet and a different brain-healthy diet. No, a liver-healthy diet is a heart-healthy diet, is a brain-healthy diet. One diet to rule them all.\n\nAnd what about drug side effects? I\u2019m not talking a little rash or something. Prescription drugs kill more than 100,000\u00a0Americans every year.\n\nWait a second\u2014106,000 deaths a year? That means that the sixth leading cause of death is actually doctors!\n\nThe sixth leading cause of death\u2026 is me! Thankfully, I can be prevented with a plant-based diet.\n\nSeriously, though, compared to 15,000 American vegetarians, meat-eaters had about twice the odds of being on aspirin, sleeping pills, tranquilizers, antacids, painkillers, blood pressure medications, laxatives (of course), and insulin. So, plant-based diets are great for those that don\u2019t like taking drugs, those that don\u2019t like paying for drugs, and for people\u00a0that don\u2019t like risking drug\u00a0side effects.\n\nWant to solve the healthcare crisis? I\u2019ve got a suggestion.\n\nThere is only one diet that\u2019s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients\u2014a plant-based diet. Anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet, ask them one simple question: \u201cHas it been proven to reverse heart disease? You know, the most likely reason you and everyone you love will die?\u201d If the answer is no, why would you even consider it?\n\nIf that\u2019s all a plant-based diet could do\u2014reverse our #1 killer, then shouldn\u2019t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing, treating, and reversing\u00a0other leading killers would seem to make the case for plant-based eating overwhelming.\n\nMost deaths in the United States are preventable, and related to nutrition. According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published, the #1 cause of death in the United States and the #1 cause of disability is our diet, which has since bumped tobacco smoking to killer #2. Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year\u2014whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more.\n\nSo, let me end with a thought experiment. Imagine yourself a smoker, back in the 1950s. The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4,000 cigarettes a year. Think about that. In the 1950s, the\n\naverage\n\nAmerican smoked a half a pack a day.\n\nThe media was telling you to smoke, and famous athletes agreed. Even Santa Claus. I mean, you want to keep fit and stay slender. So, you make sure to smoke and eat hot dogs to keep trim. And eat lots of sugar to stay slim\n\nand trim\n\n. Sugar is a lot better than that apple there, right? \u00a0I mean, sheesh.\n\nAlthough apples do \u201cconnote goodness and freshness,\u201d reads one internal tobacco industry memo, \u201cwhich brings up many possibilities for making youth-oriented cigarettes.\u201d They want to make apple-flavored cigarettes for children. Shameless!\n\n\u201cFor digestion\u2019s sake, you smoke.\u201d I mean, no curative power is claimed for Philip Morris\u2014but, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, better safe than sorry, and smoke.\n\n\u201cBlow in her face and she\u2019ll follow you anywhere.\u201d \u00a0\u201cNo woman ever says no.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cso round, so firm, so fully packed!\u201d\n\nAfter all, John Wayne smoked them, until he got lung cancer and died.\n\nBack then, even the paleo folks were smoking, and so were the doctors.\n\nThis is not to say there wasn\u2019t controversy within the medical profession. Yes, some doctors smoked Camels, but other doctors\u00a0preferred Luckies. So, there was a little conflict there.\n\nThe leader of the U.S. Senate agreed. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to give their throat a vacation? How could there be a single case of throat irritation, when \u201ccigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink?\u201d (Perhaps in Flint, Michigan!)\n\nAnd if you do get irritated? No problem; your doctor can always write you a prescription for cigarettes. This is an ad in\u00a0the\n\nJournal of the American Medical Association\n\n. So, when mainstream medicine is saying that smoking, on balance, is\u00a0good for you, when the American Medical Association is saying that, where could you turn back then if you just wanted the facts? What\u2019s the new data advanced by science? She was \u201ctoo tired for fun\u2026and then she smoked a Camel.\u201d\n\nBabe Ruth spoke of proof positive medical science\u2014that is, when he still could speak, before he died of throat cancer.\n\nNow if, by some miracle, there was a SmokingFacts.org website back then that could deliver the science directly, bypassing commercially corruptible institutional filters, you would have become aware of studies like this. An Adventist study in California published in 1958, that showed that nonsmokers may have at least 90% lower\u00a0lung cancer risk compared to smokers. But this wasn\u2019t the first.\n\nWhen famed surgeon Michael DeBakey was asked why his studies published back in the 30s linking smoking and lung cancer were simply ignored, he had to remind people about what it was like back then. We were a smoking society. It was in the movies; it was everywhere. Medical meetings were one heavy haze of smoke. Smoking was, in a word, normal.\n\nSo, back to our thought experiment: if you\u2019re a smoker in the 50s in the know, what do you do? \u00a0Do you change, or do you wait? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your smoking habit is probably not good for you. So, do you change your smoking habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between puffs, to quit, you could have cancer by then. If you wait until the powers that be officially recognize it, like the Surgeon General did in the subsequent decade, you could be dead by then.\n\nIt took 25 years for the Surgeon General\u2019s report to come out. It took more than 7,000 studies, and the deaths of countless smokers before the first Surgeon General\u2019s report against smoking was finally released in the 1960s. You\u2019d think, maybe, after the first 6,000 studies, they could have given people a little heads up or something? No, it was a powerful industry.\n\nSo, one wonders how many people are currently suffering needlessly from dietary diseases. Maybe we should have stopped smoking after the\n\n700th\n\nstudy like this came out.\n\nAs a smoker in the 50s, on one hand, you had all of society, the government, the medical profession itself telling you to smoke. And, on the other hand, all you had was the science\u2014if you were even lucky enough to be aware\u00a0of studies like this.\n\nNow fast forward, 55\u00a0years. There\u2019s a new Adventist study out of California, warning America about the risks of something else they may be putting in their mouths. And it\u2019s not just one study. According to the latest review, the total sum of evidence suggests that mortality from all causes put together, and many of our dreaded diseases\u2014heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes\u2014is significantly lower in those eating plant-based.\n\nSo, instead of someone going along with America\u2019s smoking habits in the 50s, imagine you, or someone you know, going along with America\u2019s\n\neating\n\nhabits today. What do you do? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your eating habits are probably not so good for you. So, do you change your eating habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between bites, to change your diet, it may be too late.\n\nIn fact, even after the Surgeon General\u2019s report was released, the medical community still dragged their feet. The AMA actually went on record refusing to endorse the Surgeon General\u2019s report. Why? Could that have been because they had just been handed $10 million from the tobacco industry? Maybe not;\u00a0maybe it\u2019s coincidence.\n\nSo, we know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry\u2014but why weren\u2019t individual doctors speaking out? Well, there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time, writing in, as there are today, standing up against industries killing millions. But why not more? Maybe it\u2019s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes, just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemic of dietary diseases. What was the AMA\u2019s rallying cry back then? Everything in moderation. \u201cExtensive scientific studies have proved that smoking in moderation\u201d is okay. Sound familiar?\n\nToday, the food industry uses the same tobacco industry tactics\u2014supplying misinformation, twisting the science.\n\nThe same scientists-for-hire paid to downplay the risks of secondhand smoke and toxic chemicals are the same paid\u00a0by the National Confectioners Association to downplay the risks of candy, and the same hired by the meat industry to downplay the risks of meat.\n\nConsumption of animal products and processed foods causes at least 14 million deaths around the world every\u00a0year. 14 million people dead every year. Plant-based diets can\u00a0now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking.\n\nHow many more people have to die, though, before the CDC encourages people not to wait for open-heart surgery to start eating healthy as well?\n\nUntil the system changes, we need\u00a0to take personal responsibility for our own health, and for our family\u2019s health. We can\u2019t wait until society catches up to the science, because it\u2019s a matter of life and death.\n\nLast year, Dr. Kim Williams became President of the American College of Cardiology. He was asked why he follows his own advice that he gives to patients, to eat a plant-based diet. \u201cI don\u2019t mind dying,\u201d Dr. Williams replied. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be my own fault.\u201d\n\nThank you very much.\n\nTo see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr.\u00a0Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
