As\n\nBoer\n\nfarms were destroyed by the British under their \"\n\nScorched Earth\n\n\" policy, many tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly moved into the concentration camps. Over 26,000 Boer women and children were to perish in these concentration camps.\n\n[2]\n\n1899\u20131902 Philippine\u2013American War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nSee also:\n\nUnited States Senate Committee on the Philippines \u00a7\u00a0Investigation\n\n, and\n\nAmerican war crimes\n\nIn November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the\n\nPhiladelphia Ledger\n\nwrote: \"The present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog...\"\n\n[3]\n\nIn response to the\n\nBalangiga massacre\n\n, which wiped out a U.S. company garrisoning\n\nSamar\n\ntown, U.S. Brigadier General\n\nJacob H.

Before, the\n\nSecond Boer War\n\ntook place after the\n\nHague Convention of 1899\n\n. The Second Boer War (1899 until 1902) is known for the first concentration camps (1900 until 1902) for civilians in the 20th century.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|

The massacre was reported to a newspaper by American citizens who were also on board the Nicosian .[21]   Another attack occurred on 24 September a month later when Baralong  destroyed U-41 , which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship Urbino .

The lands were to be expropriated, and the owners deported to Siberia. The land was to be given to Russian war veterans once the war was over. In July 1915, without prior warning, 150,000 German settlers from Volhynia were arrested and shipped to internal exile in Siberia and Central Asia. (Some sources indicate that the number of deportees reached 200,000). Ukrainian peasants took over their lands.

Contributing factors included\n\nNazi\n\nrace theory, a desire for \"living space\" that justified the eradication of native populations, and militaristic indoctrination that encouraged the terrorization of conquered peoples and\n\nprisoners of war\n\n. The\n\nHolocaust\n\n, the German attack on the Soviet Union and occupation of much of Europe, the Japanese occupation of\n\nManchuria\n\nand the Philippines and attack on China all contributed to well over half of the civilian deaths in World War II and the conflicts that led up to the war. Even before post-war revelations of atrocities, Axis militaries were notorious for their brutal treatment of captured combatants.\n\nCrimes perpetrated by Germany\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nFurther information:\n\nNazi Germany\n\n,\n\nGerman war crimes \u00a7\u00a0World War II\n\n, and\n\nConsequences of Nazism\n\nAccording to the\n\nNuremberg Trials\n\n, there were four major war crimes that were alleged against German military (and Waffen-SS and NSDAP) men and officers, each with individual events that made up the major charges.\n\n1. Participation in a common plan of\n\nconspiracy\n\nfor the accomplishment of\n\ncrimes against peace\n\n2. Planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace\n\nPlanning and executing a campaign of invasion of its European neighbors, as well as the conspiracy to violate the\n\nTreaty of Versailles\n\nand the\n\nTreaty of Saint-Germain\n\nthrough the\n\nremilitarization of the Rhineland\n\n, and the annexations of\n\nAustria\n\nand\n\nCzechoslovakia\n\n.\n\n3. War Crimes\n\nAtrocities against enemy combatants or conventional crimes committed by military units (see\n\nWar crimes of the Wehrmacht\n\n), and include:\n\nInvasion of Poland\n\n: During the period of 1 September \u2013 25 October 1939 German forces in their military actions engaged in executions of Polish POWs, bombing hospitals, murdering civilians, shooting refugees, and executing wounded soldiers. The cautious estimates give a number of at least 16,000 murdered victims.\n\n[43]\n\nPacification Operations in German occupied Poland\n\n: During the occupation of Poland by German Reich, Wehrmacht forces took part in several pacification actions in rural areas, that resulted in murder of at least 20,000 Polish villagers.\n\nLe Paradis massacre\n\n: In May 1940, British soldiers of the\n\nRoyal Norfolk Regiment\n\nwere captured by the SS and subsequently murdered.\n\nFritz Knoechlein\n\nwas tried found guilty and hanged.\n\nWormhoudt massacre\n\n: In May 1940, British and French soldiers were captured by the SS and subsequently murdered. No one found guilty of the crime.\n\nd'Ardenne Massacres\n\n: In June 1944 Canadian soldiers were captured by the SS and murdered by the\n\n12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend\n\n. SS General\n\nKurt Meyer (Panzermeyer)\n\nwas sentenced to be shot 1946. His sentence was commuted and he was released in 1954.\n\nMalmedy massacre\n\n: In December 1944, United States POWs captured by\n\nKampfgruppe Peiper\n\nwere murdered outside\n\nMalmedy\n\n, Belgium.\n\nAnnouncement of execution of 150 Polish hostages as revenge for assassination of 6 Germans, Warsaw,\n\nNazi-occupied Poland\n\n, May 1944\n\nGardelegen (war crime)\n\n: The German SS forced 1,016 slave laborers who were part of transports evacuated from several sub-camps of\n\nMittelbau-Dora\n\nConcentration Camp and from the sub-camp Hannover-St\u00f6cken of\n\nNeuengamme\n\nConcentration Camp into a large barn which was then lit on fire. Most of the prisoners were burned alive; some were shot trying to escape.\n\nMarzabotto massacre\n\n: The German SS killing of at least 770 civilians of Marzabotto as a collective punishment for their support of Italian partisans and the\n\nItalian resistance movement\n\nSant'Anna di Stazzema massacre\n\n: A massacre was committed in the hill village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema in Tuscany, Italy, in the course of an operation against the Italian resistance movement during the Italian Campaign of World War II.  560 local villagers and refugees were murdered and their bodies burnt in a scorched earth policy action by the Nazis.\n\nCefalonia Massacre\n\n: The mass execution of the men of the Italian 33rd Acqui Infantry Division by the Germans on the island of Cephalonia, Greece was committed after the\n\nItalian armistice\n\n.\n\nOradour-sur-Glane massacre\n\n: On 10 June 1944, the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in Haute-Vienne in then Nazi occupied France was destroyed.  642 of its inhabitants, including women and children, were massacred by a Waffen-SS company.\n\nThe annihilation of the Czech city of\n\nLidice\n\nwas committed as an act of vengeance for the assassination of\n\nReinhard Heydrich\n\n.\n\nMassacre of Kalavryta\n\n: The extermination of the male population and the total destruction of the town of Kalavryta, in Greece, by German occupying forces during World War II, was committed on 13 December 1943.\n\nDistomo massacre\n\n: This attack was perpetrated by members of the Waffen-SS in the village of Distomo, Greece, during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II.\n\nKragujevac massacre\n\n:  This was a\n\nnazi war crime\n\nin which\n\nSerbs\n\n,\n\nJews\n\nand\n\nRoma\n\nmen and boys in\n\nKragujevac\n\n,\n\nSerbia\n\n, were murdered by\n\nGerman\n\nWehrmacht\n\nsoldiers on 20 and 21 October 1941.\n\nThe suppression of the 1944\n\nWarsaw Uprising\n\nand\n\nsubsequent leveling of the whole city\n\nwas a war crime.\n\nNaked\n\nSoviet prisoners of war\n\nin Mauthausen concentration camp. Unknown date\n\nThe treatment of Soviet POWs throughout the war, who were not given the protections and guarantees of the\n\nGeneva Convention\n\nunlike other Allied prisoners was a war crime.\n\nNazi crimes against Soviet POWs\n\n, resulted in some 3.3 million to 3.5 million deaths.  This accounts for about 60% of all Soviet\n\nPOWs.\n\n[44]\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare\n\nagainst merchant shipping was another war crime.\n\nCommando Order\n\nwhich stated that Allied combatants encountered during\n\ncommando\n\noperations were to be executed immediately upon capture and without trial, even if they were properly uniformed, unarmed, or intending to surrender was a war crime.\n\nCommissar Order\n\n:  An order stating that\n\nSoviet\n\npolitical commissars found among captured troops were to be executed immediately was a war crime.\n\nVinkt Massacre\n\n: In May 1940 at least 86 civilians in Vinkt were killed by the German\n\nWehrmacht\n\n.\n\nHeusden\n\n: A town hall was massacred in November 1944.\n\nGerman war crimes during the Battle of Moscow\n\nare another example.\n\n4. Crimes against Humanity\n\nCrimes committed well away from the lines of battle and unconnected in any way to military activity, distinct from war crimes\n\nThe major crime was the\n\nHolocaust\n\n, including:\n\nThe construction and use of\n\nVernichtungslagern\n\n(extermination camps) to commit genocide, most prominently at\n\nAuschwitz\n\n,\n\nTreblinka\n\n,\n\nMajdanek\n\n,\n\nBe\u0142\u017cec\n\n,\n\nSobib\u00f3r\n\n, and\n\nChe\u0142mno\n\nThe employment of other concentration camps across Europe, including\n\nDachau\n\n,\n\nSachsenhausen\n\n,\n\nMauthausen\n\nand\n\nBergen-Belsen\n\n, which held Soviet POWs and political prisoners in inhuman conditions, and transported Jews and Roma to extermination camps\n\nDeath marches\n\nof prisoners, particularly in the last months of the war when the aforementioned camps were being overrun by the\n\nAllies\n\nThe widespread use of\n\nslave labor\n\nand forced/unfree labor by the Nazi regime, including the use of\n\nconcentration camp\n\nand\n\nextermination camp\n\nprisoners as slaves, often with the intent of\n\nextermination through labor\n\nGerman police shooting women and children from the\n\nMizocz Ghetto\n\n, 14 October 1942\n\nThe establishment of Jewish\n\nGhettos\n\nin Eastern Europe intended to isolate Jewish communities for deportation and subsequent extermination\n\nThe use of\n\nSS\n\nEinsatzgruppen\n\n, mobile extermination squads, to exterminate Jews and anti-nazi \"partisans\"\n\nBabi Yar\n\na series of massacres in Kiev, the most notorious and the best documented of these massacres took place on 29\u201330 September 1941, wherein 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation. The decision to kill all the Jews in Kiev was made by the military governor, Major-General Kurt Eberhard, the Police Commander for Army Group South, SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Friedrich Jeckeln, and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by Sonderkommando 4a soldiers, along with the aid of the SD and SS Police Battalions backed by the local police.\n\nRumbula\n\na collective term for incidents on two non-consecutive days (November 30 and December 8, 1941) in which about 25,000 Jews were killed in or on the way to Rumbula forest near Riga, Latvia, during the Holocaust\n\nNinth Fort\n\nBy the order of SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer Karl J\u00e4ger and SS-Rottenf\u00fchrer\n\nHelmut Rauca\n\n, the Sonderkommando under the leadership of SS-Obersturmf\u00fchrer Joachim Hamann, and 8 to 10 men from Einsatzkommando 3, in collaboration with Lithuanian partisans, murdered 2,007 Jewish men, 2,920 women, and 4,273 children in a single day at the Ninth Fort, Kaunas, Lithuania.\n\nSimferopol\n\nGermans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol, killing in total over 22,000 locals\u2014mostly\n\nJews\n\n,\n\nRussians\n\n,\n\nKrymchaks\n\n, and\n\nGypsies\n\n.\n\n[45]\n\nOn one occasion, starting December 9, 1941, the\n\nEinsatzgruppen D\n\nunder\n\nOtto Ohlendorf\n\n's command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents, most of them being Jews.\n\n[46]\n\nThe massacre of 100,000 Jews and Poles at\n\nPaneriai\n\nThe suppression of the 1943\n\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising\n\nwhich erupted when the SS came to clear the Jewish ghetto and send all of the occupants to extermination camps\n\nAleksandras Lileikis\n\n, a Nazi\n\nSaugumas\n\nunit commander who oversaw the murder of 60,000 Jews in\n\nLithuania\n\n. He later worked for the\n\nCIA\n\n.\n\n[47]\n\nIzieu Massacre\n\nIzieu was the site of a Jewish orphanage during the Second World War. On 6 April 1944, three vehicles pulled up in front of the orphanage. The Gestapo, under the direction of the 'Butcher of Lyon'\n\nKlaus Barbie\n\n, entered the orphanage and forcibly removed the forty-four children and their seven supervisors, throwing the crying and terrified children on to the trucks. Following the raid on their home in Izieu, the children were shipped directly to the \"collection center\" in Drancy, then put on the first available train towards the concentration camps in the East.\n\nOther crimes against humanity included:\n\nThe\n\nPorajmos\n\n, the mass killings of the\n\nRomany\n\npeoples of Europe by the Nazis\n\nThe\n\n\u0141apanka\n\nor \"Catching Game\", \u2013 Nazi roundups of Poles in the major cities for slave labor\n\nNikolaev Massacre\n\n, which resulted in the deaths of 35,782 Soviet citizens, most of whom were Jews.\n\nOperation Tannenberg\n\n, the\n\nAB Action\n\nand the\n\nMassacre of Lw\u00f3w professors\n\n, all Nazi actions in Poland meant to mass murder the Polish intelligentsia and other potential leaders of resistance.\n\n[48]\n\n[49]\n\nThe Nazi\n\nT-4 Euthanasia Program\n\n, an aborted eugenics program meant to kill German children who were mentally or physically handicapped. 200,000 people were murdered due to this program.\n\nAt least 10 million, and perhaps over 20 million perished directly and indirectly due to the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes by the Nazi regime, of which the Holocaust lives on in particular infamy, for its particularly cruel nature and scope, and the industrialised nature of the genocide of Jewish citizens of states invaded or controlled by the Nazi regime. At least 5.9 million\n\nJews\n\nwere murdered by the Nazis, or 66 to 78% of Europe's Jewish population, although a complete count may never be known. Though much of Continental Europe suffered under the Nazi occupation, Poland, in particular, was the state most devastated by these crimes, with 90% of its Jews as well as many ethnic Poles slaughtered by the Nazis and their affiliates. After the war, from 1945\u201349, the Nazi regime was put on trial in two\n\ntribunals\n\nin\n\nNuremberg\n\n, Germany by the victorious\n\nAllied powers\n\n.\n\nThe\n\nfirst tribunal\n\nindicted\n\n24 major Nazi war criminals, and resulted in 19\n\nconvictions\n\n(of which 12 led to\n\ndeath sentences\n\n) and 3\n\nacquittals\n\n, 2 of the accused died before a verdict was rendered, at least one of which by killing himself with cyanide.\n\n[50]\n\nThe\n\nsecond tribunal\n\nindicted 185 members of the military, economic, and political leadership of Nazi Germany, of which 142 were convicted and 35 were acquitted. In subsequent decades, approximately 20 additional war criminals who escaped capture in the immediate aftermath of World War II were tried in\n\nWest Germany\n\nand Israel.

In 1958, all charges were dropped and sentences were reduced. |                                                                                                                  Following the US invasion of Luzon in 1944, the Japanese high command ordered that all POWs remaining in the island are to be exterminated at all cost. As a result, on December 14, 1944, units from the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army  stationed in the Puerto Princesa POW camp in Palawan rounded up 150 remaining POWs still garrisoned in the camp, herded them into air raid shelters, before dousing the shelters with gasoline and setting it on fire. Of the handful of POWs that were able to escape the flames were hunted before being gunned down, bayonetted, or burned alive. Only 11 POWs survived the ordeal and were able to escape to Allied lines to report the incident.[75] | \n|                     Alexandra Hospital massacre , Battle of Singapore , 1942 |                                                                                                                                                                          War crimes |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                no prosecutions |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   At about 1pm on February 14, Japanese approached Alexandra Barracks Hospital.

A directive dated 20 December 1941, addressed to newly appointed commanders in Montenegro, Major \u0110or\u0111ije La\u0161i\u0107 and Captain Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, outlined, among other things, the cleansing of all non-Serb elements in order to create a Greater Serbia:\n\n[91]\n\nThe struggle for the liberty of our whole nation under the scepter of His Majesty King Peter II;\n\nthe creation of a Great Yugoslavia and within it of a\n\nGreat Serbia\n\nwhich is to be ethnically pure and is to include Serbia,\n\nMontenegro\n\n,\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\n,\n\nSrijem\n\n, the\n\nBanat\n\n, and\n\nBa\u010dka\n\n;\n\nthe struggle for the inclusion into Yugoslavia of all still unliberated Slovene territories under the Italians and Germans (\n\nTrieste\n\n,\n\nGorizia\n\n,\n\nIstria\n\n, and\n\nCarinthia\n\n) as well as Bulgaria, and northern\n\nAlbania\n\nwith\n\nSkadar\n\n;\n\nthe cleansing of the state territory of all national minorities and a-national elements;\n\nthe creation of contiguous frontiers between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and\n\nSlovenia\n\nby cleansing the Muslim population from\n\nSand\u017eak\n\nand the Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\u2014\n\nDirective of 20 December 1941\n\n[91]\n\nChetniks in\n\n\u0160umadija\n\nkill a Partisan through heart extraction\n\nThe Chetniks systemically massacred Muslims in villages that they captured.\n\n[92]\n\nIn late autumn of 1941 the Italians handed over the towns of Vi\u0161egrad, Gora\u017ede, Fo\u010da and the surrounding areas, in south-east Bosnia to the Chetniks to run as a puppet administration and NDH forces were compelled by the Italians to withdraw from there. After the Chetniks gained control of\n\nGora\u017ede\n\non 29 November 1941, they began a massacre of Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials that became a systematic massacre of the local Muslim civilian population.\n\n[93]\n\nSeveral hundred Muslims were murdered and their bodies were left hanging in the town or thrown into the Drina river.\n\n[93]\n\nOn 5 December 1941, the Chetniks received the town of\n\nFo\u010da\n\nfrom the Italians and proceeded to massacre around 500 Muslims.\n\n[93]\n\nAdditional massacres against the Muslims in the area of Fo\u010da took place in August 1942. In total, more than 2000 people were killed in Fo\u010da.\n\n[94]\n\nIn early January, Chetniks entered\n\nSrebrenica\n\nand killed around 1000 Muslim civilians there and in nearby villages. Around the same time the Chetniks made their way to\n\nVi\u0161egrad\n\nwhere deaths were reportedly in the thousands.\n\n[95]\n\nMassacres continued in the following months in the region.\n\n[96]\n\nIn the village of\n\n\u017depa\n\nalone about three hundred were killed in late 1941.\n\n[96]\n\nIn early January, Chetniks massacred fifty-four Muslims in\n\n\u010celebi\u0107\n\nand burned down the village. On 3 March, Chetniks burned forty-two Muslim villagers to death in Drakan.\n\n[95]\n\nIn early January 1943 and again in early February, Montenegrin Chetnik units were ordered to carry out \"cleansing actions\" against Muslims, first in the\n\nBijelo Polje\n\ncounty in Sand\u017eak and then in February in the\n\n\u010cajni\u010de\n\ncounty and part of Fo\u010da county in southeastern Bosnia, and in part of the\n\nPljevlja\n\ncounty in Sand\u017eak.\n\n[97]\n\nPavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107\n\n, the officer in charge of these operations, reported to Mihailovi\u0107, Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command, that on 10 January 1943: \"thirty-three Muslim villages had been burned down, and 400 Muslim fighters (members of the Muslim self-protection militia supported by the Italians) and about 1,000 women and children had been killed, as against 14 Chetnik dead and 26 wounded\".\n\n[97]\n\nIn another report sent by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 dated 13 February 1943, he reported that: \"Chetniks killed about 1,200 Muslim fighters and about 8,000 old people, women, and children; Chetnik losses in the action were 22 killed and 32 wounded\".\n\n[97]\n\nHe added that \"during the operation the total destruction of the Muslim inhabitants was carried out regardless of sex and age\".\n\n[98]\n\nThe total number of deaths caused by the anti-Muslim operations between January and February 1943 is estimated at 10,000.\n\n[97]\n\nThe casualty rate would have been higher had a great number of Muslims not already fled the area, most to\n\nSarajevo\n\n, when the February action began.\n\n[97]\n\nAccording to a statement from the Chetnik Supreme Command from 24 February 1943, these were countermeasures taken against Muslim aggressive activities; however, all circumstances show that these massacres were committed in accordance with implementing the directive of 20 December 1941.\n\n[94]\n\nActions against the Croats were of a smaller scale but comparable in action.\n\n[99]\n\nIn early October 1942 in the village of\n\nGata\n\n, where an estimated 100 people were killed and many homes burnt in reprisal taken for the destruction of roads in the area carried out on the Italians' account.\n\n[94]\n\nThat same month, formations under the command of Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 and Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107, who were participating in the Italian\n\nOperation Alfa\n\nin the area of\n\nProzor\n\n, massacred over 500 Croats and Muslims and burnt numerous villages.\n\n[94]\n\nBa\u0107ovi\u0107 noted that \"Our Chetniks killed all men 15 years of age or older.\u00a0... Seventeen villages were burned to the ground.\"\n\n[100]\n\nMario Roatta\n\n, commander of the\n\nItalian Second Army\n\n, objected to these \"massive slaughters\" of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end.\n\n[100]\n\nCrimes perpetrated by the Ustashas\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe\n\nUsta\u0161a\n\nintended to create an ethnically \"pure\"\n\nGreater Croatia\n\n, and they viewed those\n\nSerbs\n\nthen living in Croatia,\n\nBosnia\n\nand\n\nHerzegovina\n\nas the biggest obstacle to this goal. Ustasha ministers\n\nMile Budak\n\n, Mirko Puk and Milovan \u017dani\u0107 declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustasha policy was an ethnically pure Croatia. The strategy to achieve their goal was:\n\n[101]\n\n[102]\n\nOne-third of the Serbs were to be killed\n\nOne-third of the Serbs were to be expelled\n\nOne-third of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to\n\nCatholicism\n\nThe\n\nIndependent State of Croatia\n\ngovernment cooperated with Nazi Germany in\n\nthe Holocaust\n\nand exercised their own version of the\n\ngenocide\n\nagainst Serbs, as well as\n\nJews\n\nand\n\nGypsies\n\n(Roma) (aka \"gypsies\") inside its borders. State policy towards Serbs had first been declared in the words of Milovan \u017dani\u0107, a minister of the NDH Legislative council, on 2 May 1941:\n\nUsta\u0161a soldiers sawing off the head of Branko Jungi\u0107, an ethnic Serb, near\n\nBosanska Gradi\u0161ka\n\n.\n\nThis country can only be a Croatian country, and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given the opportunity.\n\n[103]\n\nAccording to the\n\nSimon Wiesenthal Center\n\n(citing the\n\nEncyclopedia of the Holocaust\n\n), \"Ustasa terrorists killed 500,000 Serbs, expelled 250,000 and forced 250,000 to convert to Roman Catholicism. They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies.\"\n\n[104]\n\nThe execution methods used by the Ustasha were particularly brutal and sadistic and often included torture, dismemberment or decapitation.\n\n[105]\n\nA Gestapo report to Heinrich Himmler from 1942 stated, \"The Usta\u0161e committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age but especially against helpless old people, women and children.\"\n\n[106]\n\nNumerous concentration camps were built in the NDH, most notably\n\nJasenovac\n\n, the largest, where around 100,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma, as well as a number of Croatian political dissidents, died, mostly from torture and starvation.\n\n[107]\n\nIt was established in August 1941 and not dismantled until April 1945, shortly before the end of the war. Jasenovac was a complex of five subcamps and three smaller camps spread out over 240 square kilometers (93\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), in relatively close proximity to each other, on the bank of the Sava river.\n\n[108]\n\nMost of the camp was at\n\nJasenovac\n\n, about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southeast of\n\nZagreb\n\n. The complex also included large grounds at Donja Gradina directly across the\n\nSava River\n\n, the\n\nJastrebarsko children's camp\n\nto the northwest, and the\n\nStara Gradi\u0161ka camp\n\n(Jasenovac V) for women and children to the southeast.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nUnlike Nazi camps, most murders at Jasenovac were done manually using hammers, axes, knives and other implements.\n\n[109]\n\nAccording to testimony, on the night of August 29, 1942, guards at the camp organized a competition to see who could slaughter the most inmates, with guard and former\n\nFranciscan\n\npriest\n\nPetar Brzica\n\nwinning by cutting the throats of 1,360 inmates.\n\n[109]\n\nA special knife called a \"Srbosjek\" (Serb-cutter) was designed for the slaughtering of prisoners.\n\n[110]\n\nPrisoners were sometimes tied with barbed wire, then taken to a ramp near to the\n\nSava River\n\nwhere weights were placed on the wires, their throats and stomachs slashed before their bodies were dumped into the river.\n\n[109]\n\nAfter unsuccessful experiments with gas vans, camp commander\n\nVjekoslav Luburi\u0107\n\nhad a gas chamber built at Jasenovac V, where a considerable number of inmates were killed during a three-month experiment with sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B, but this method was abandoned due to poor construction.\n\n[111]\n\nThe Ustashe cremated living inmates as well as corpses.\n\n[112]\n\n[113]\n\nOther methods of torture and killing done included: inserting hot nails under finger nails, mutilating parts of the body including plucking out eyeballs, tightening chains around ones head until the skull fractured and the eyes popped and also, placing salt in open wounds.\n\n[114]\n\nWomen were subjected to rape and torture,\n\n[115]\n\nincluding breast mutilation.\n\n[116]\n\nPregnant women had their wombs cut out.\n\n[117]\n\nAn escape attempt on 22 April 1945 by 600 male inmates failed and only 84 male prisoners escaped successfully.\n\n[118]\n\nThe remainder and about 400 other prisoners were then murdered by Ustasha guards, despite the fact that they knew the war was ending with Germany's capitulation.\n\n[119]\n\nAll the female inmates from the women's camp (more than 700) had been massacred by the guards the previous day.\n\n[119]\n\nThe guards then destroyed the camp and everything associated with it was burned to the ground.\n\n[119]\n\nOther concentration camps were the\n\n\u0110akovo camp\n\n,\n\nGospi\u0107 camp\n\n,\n\nJadovno camp\n\n,\n\nKru\u0161\u010dica camp\n\nand the\n\nLepoglava camp\n\n.\n\nUstasha militias and death squads also burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian Serbs in the country-side in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools. Men, women, children were hacked to death, thrown alive into pits and down ravines, or set on fire in churches.\n\n[120]\n\nSome Serb villages near\n\nSrebrenica\n\nand\n\nOzren\n\nwere wholly massacred, while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between\n\nVlasenica\n\nand\n\nKladanj\n\n.\n\n[121]\n\nThe\n\nGlina massacres\n\n, where thousands of Serbs were killed, are among the more notable instances of Ustasha cruelty.\n\nAnte Paveli\u0107\n\n, leader of the Ustasha, fled to Argentina and Spain which gave him protection, and was never extradited to stand trial for his war crimes. Paveli\u0107 died on 28 December 1959 at the Hospital Alem\u00e1n in\n\nMadrid\n\n, where the Roman Catholic church had helped him to gain asylum, at the age of 70 from gunshot wounds sustained in an earlier assassination attempt by Montenegrin\n\nBlagoje Jovovi\u0107\n\n.\n\n[122]\n\nSome other prominent Ustashe figures and their respective fates:\n\nAndrija Artukovi\u0107\n\n, Croatian Minister of Interior. Died in Croatian custody.\n\nMile Budak, Croatian politician and chief Ustashe ideologist. Tried and executed by Yugoslav authorities.\n\nPetar Brzica, Franciscan friar who won a throat-cutting contest at Jasenovac. Post-war fate unknown.\n\nMiroslav Filipovi\u0107\n\n, camp commander and Franciscan friar notorious for his cruelty and sadism. Tried and executed by Yugoslav authorities.\n\nSlavko Kvaternik\n\n, Ustashe military commander-in-chief. Tried and executed by Yugoslav authorities.\n\nVjekoslav \"Maks\" Luburi\u0107, commander of the Usta\u0161e Defence Brigades (\n\nUsta\u0161ka Odbrana\n\n) and Jasenovac camp. Murdered in Spain.\n\nDinko \u0160aki\u0107\n\n, Ustashe commander of Jasenovac. Fled to Argentina, extradited to Croatia for trial in 1998. Sentenced to 20 years and died in prison in 2008.\n\nMost Ustashe fled the country following the war, mainly with the help of Father\n\nKrunoslav Draganovi\u0107\n\n, secretary of the\n\nCollege of Sian Girolamo\n\nwho helped Ustasha fugitives immigrate illegally to South America.\n\n[123]\n\nCrimes perpetrated by the Ukrainian nationalists\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe Ukrainian\n\nOUN-B\n\ngroup, along with their military force \u2013\n\nUkrainian Insurgent Army\n\n(UPA) \u2013 are responsible for a\n\ngenocide on the Polish population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia\n\n. Starting in March 1943, with its peak in the summer 1943, as many as 80,000 -100,000. Although the main target were\n\nPoles\n\n, many\n\nJews\n\n,\n\nCzechs\n\nand those\n\nUkrainians\n\nunwilling to participate in the crimes, were massacred as well. Lacking good armament and ammunition, UPA members commonly used tools such as axes and pitchforks for the slaughter. As a result of these massacres, almost the entire non-Ukrainian population of Volhynia was either killed or forced to flee. However, the premix of this ethnic cleansing was the war of Polish partisan Homeland Army against Ukraine, in which Poland wanted to re-occupy Western Ukraine, treacherously captured in 1921. Homeland Army committed a genocide of Ukrainians during this conquest campaign, killed as many as 15000 mostly in near-border villages and practiced unprecedented cruelty against UPA partisans.\n\nUPA commanders responsible for the genocide:\n\nRoman Shukhevych\n\n- general of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. As a leader of the UPA he was to be aware and to approve the project of ethnic cleansing in\n\nVolhynia\n\nand Eastern Galicia.\n\nDmytro Klyachkivsky\n\n- colonel of the UPA. He gave the order \"to wipe out an entire Polish male population between 16 and 60 years old\" (according to the research of the Ukrainian historians, this citation may be falsified by the Soviet intelligence). Klyachkivsky is regarded as the main initiator of the massacres.\n\nMykola Lebed\n\n- one of the OUN leaders, and UPA fighter. By the National Archives, he is described as \"Ukrainian fascist leader and suspected\n\nNazi\n\ncollaborator\"\n\nStepan Bandera\n\n- leader of the OUN-B. His view was to remove all Poles, who were hostile towards the OUN, and assimilate the rest of them. The role of the main architect of the massacres is often assigned to him. However, he was imprisoned in German concentration camp since 1941, so there is a strong suspicion, that he wasn't fully aware of events in Volhynia.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nAllied powers\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nAllied war crimes during World War II\n\nCrimes perpetrated by the Soviet Union\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nSoviet war crimes\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Concurrent with World War II | \n|                                                                                                                                   Incident |                                          type of crime |                                                                 Persons responsible |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Notes | \n|                                                                                                                            Katy\u0144 massacre |           War crimes (Murder of Polish intelligentsia) |                                  Lavrenty Beria , Joseph Stalin [124]  [125]  [126] |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           An NKVD -committed massacre of tens of thousands of Polish officers and intelligentsia throughout the spring of 1940.

It was recaptured by the Germans soon afterwards and the German authorities reported that the Red Army killed civilians there. Nazi  propaganda widely disseminated the description of the event with horrible details, supposedly to boost the determination of German soldiers to resist the general Soviet advance. Because the incident was investigated by the Nazis and reports were disseminated as Nazi propaganda, discerning the facts from the fiction of the incident is difficult. | \n| Invasion of East Prussia Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II Expulsion of Germans after World War II |     War crimesCrimes against humanity (mass expulsion) |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 War crimes committed against German civilian population by the Red Army in occupied Eastern and Central Germany, and against ethnic-German populations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Jugoslavia.

On two occasions, once off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt , and the other off the coast of Crete , the crew attacked and killed dozens of shipwrecked German sailors and troops. None of the shipwrecked survivors posed a major threat to Torbay's  crew. Miers made no attempt to hide his actions, and reported them in his official logs. He received a strongly worded reprimand from his superiors following the first incident. Meir's actions violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.[138]  [139] | \n|                  Sinking of German hospital ship Tubingen |                     War crimes (attacking hospital ships) |                                                                                                                               no prosecutions |         On 18 November 1944, the German hospital ship  Tubingen  was sunk by two British Beaufighter  bombers off Pola , in the Adriatic Sea .

Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer described in January 1950 the convictions of German prisoners of war in Yugoslavia as \"crimes and crimes against humanity\".[152] | In Yugoslavia in particular, with many exceptions, the Danube Swabian minority \"collaborated . . . with the occupation\".[153]   Consequently, on November 21, 1944 the Presidium of the AVNOJ (the Yugoslav parliament) declared the ethnic German minority in Yugoslavia collectively hostile to the Yugoslav state. The AVNOJ Presidium issued a decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property of Nazi Germany and its citizens in Yugoslavia, persons of ethnic German nationality (regardless of citizenship), and collaborators. The decision acquired the force of law on February 6, 1945.[154]   Of a pre-war population of about 350,000 ethnic Germans in the Vojvodina, the 1958 census revealed 32,000 left. Officially, Yugoslavia denied the forcible starvation and killing of their Schwowisch populations, but reconstruction of the labor camps reveals that of the 170,000 Danube Swabians interned from 1944 to 1948, over 50,000 died of mistreatment.[155]    About 55,000 people died in the concentration camps, another 31,000 died serving in the German armed forces, and about 31,000 disappeared, mostly likely dead, with another 37,000 still unaccounted for. Thus the total victims of the war and subsequent ethnic cleansing and killings comprised about 30% of the pre-war German population.[156]   In addition, 35,000\u201340,000 Swabian children under age sixteen were separated from their parents and force into prison camps and re-education orphanages. Many were adopted by Serbian Partisan families.[157] | \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1946\u20131954: Indochina War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe French Union's struggle against the\n\nindependence movement\n\nbacked by the Soviet Union and China claimed 500,000 to 1.5 million Vietnamese lives from 1945 to 1954.\n\n[158]\n\nIn the\n\nHaiphong massacre\n\nof 1946, about 6,000 Vietnamese were killed by naval artillery.\n\n[158]\n\nThe French employed electric shock treatment during interrogations of the Vietnamese, and nearly 10,000 Vietnamese perished in French concentration camps.\n\n[158]\n\n1947\u20131948: Malagasy Uprising\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe French repressed the\n\nindependence movement\n\nwith killings and village burnings.

Commanders feared enemy infiltrators among such refugee columns. Estimates of the dead have ranged from dozens to 500. In 2005, a South Korean government committee certified the names of 163 dead or missing and 55 wounded and added that many other victims' names were not reported.[166]   The South Korean

Throughout the conflict, North Korean and Chinese forces routinely mistreated U.S. and UN prisoners of war. Mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run\n\nPOW camps\n\nduring the winter of 1950\u201351. About 43 percent of all U.S. POWs died during this period. In violation of the\n\nGeneva Conventions\n\nwhich explicitly stated that captor states must\n\nrepatriate\n\nprisoners of war to their homeland as quickly as possible, North Korea detained South Korean POWs for decades after the ceasefire. Over 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the Communists' themselves had claimed they had captured 70,000 South Koreans.\n\n[172]\n\n[173]\n\n:\n\n141\n\nSouth Korean perpetrated crimes\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                                                                  Armed conflict |                                                                          Perpetrator | \n|                                                                                      Korean War |                                                                          South Korea | \n|                       Incident |                                                  Type of crime | Persons responsible |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Notes | \n|                  Jeju uprising | War crimes, Crimes against humanity (mass murder of civilians) |         South Korea |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The island of Jeju was considered a stronghold of the Korean independence movement  and the South Korean Labor Party . .[174]  :166\u2013167  [175]   Syngman Rhee  had proclaimed martial law to quell an insurgency.[176]   Up to 10% of the island's population died (14,000 to 30,000) as a result of the conflict,[174]  :195  [177]  :13   and another 40,000 fled to Japan.[175] | \n|           Bodo League massacre | War crimes, Crimes against humanity (mass murder of civilians) |         South Korea |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Bodo League massacre (Korean :\u00a0\ubcf4\ub3c4\uc5f0\ub9f9 \uc0ac\uac74 ; Hanja :\u00a0\u4fdd\u5c0e\u806f\u76df\u4e8b\u4ef6 ) was a massacre  and war crime  against communists  and suspected sympathisers that occurred in the summer of 1950 during the Korean War .

In response to the rebellion, many Kikuyu were relocated. 320,000\u2013450,000 of them were moved into\n\nconcentration camps\n\n. Most of the remainder \u2013 more than a million \u2013 were held in \"enclosed villages\". Although some were Mau Mau guerillas, many were victims of\n\ncollective punishment\n\nthat colonial authorities imposed on large areas of the country. Thousands suffered beatings and\n\nsexual assaults\n\nduring \"screenings\" intended to extract information about the Mau Mau threat. Later, prisoners suffered even worse mistreatment in an attempt to force them to renounce their allegiance to the insurgency and to obey commands. Significant numbers were murdered; official accounts describe some prisoners being roasted alive. Prisoners were questioned with the help of \"slicing off ears, boring holes in eardrums, flogging until death, pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight, and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes\". British soldiers used a \"metal\n\ncastrating\n\ninstrument\" to cut off testicles and fingers. \"By the time I cut his balls off\", one settler boasted, \"he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.\" According to David Anderson, the British hanged over 1,090 suspected rebels: far more than the French had executed in\n\nAlgeria\n\nduring the\n\nAlgerian War\n\n.\n\n[185]\n\nIt was found out that over half of them executed were not rebels at all. Thousands more were killed by British soldiers, who claimed they had \"failed to halt\" when challenged.\n\n[186]\n\n[187]\n\n[185]\n\nThe\n\nChuka Massacre\n\n, which happened in\n\nChuka, Kenya\n\n, was perpetrated by members of the\n\nKing's African Rifles\n\nB Company in June 1953 with 20 unarmed people killed during the Mau Mau uprising. Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on June 13, 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. It is found out that most of the people executed were actually belonged to the\n\nKikuyu Home Guard\n\n\u2013 a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight an increasingly powerful and audacious guerrilla enemy. In an atmosphere of atrocity and reprisal, the matter was swept under the carpet and nobody ever stood trial for the massacre.\n\nThe\n\nHola massacre\n\nwas an incident during the conflict in\n\nKenya\n\nagainst\n\nBritish colonial rule\n\nat a colonial detention camp in\n\nHola, Kenya\n\n. By January 1959 the camp had a population of 506 detainees of whom 127 were held in a secluded \"closed camp\". This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial \"rehabilitation process\" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action \u2013 as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.\n\n[188]\n\n77 surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nThe British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability.\n\n[189]\n\nThe Lari massacre in the settlement of\n\nLari\n\noccurred on the night of 25\u201326 March 1953, in which Mau Mau militants herded Kikuyu men, women and children into huts and set fire to them, killing anyone who attempted to escape. Official estimates place the death toll from the Lari massacre at 74 dead.\n\n[190]\n\nMau Mau militants also tortured, mutilated and murdered Kikuyu on many occasions.\n\n[191]\n\nMau Mau racked up 1,819 murders of their fellow Africans, though again this number excludes the many additional hundreds who 'disappeared', whose bodies were never found.\n\n[192]\n\n1954\u20131962: Algerian War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe insurgency began in 1945 and was\n\nrevived in 1954\n\n, winning independence in the early 1960s. The French army killed thousands of Algerians in the first round of fighting in 1945.\n\n[158]\n\nAfter the Algerian independence movement formed a National Liberation Front (FLN) in 1954, the French Minister of the Interior joined the Minister of National Defense in 1955 in ordering that every rebel carrying a weapon, suspected of doing so, or suspected of fleeing, must be shot.\n\n[158]\n\nFrench troops executed civilians from nearby villages when rebel attacks occurred, tortured both rebels and civilians, and interned Arabs in camps, where forced labor was required of some of them.\n\n[158]\n\n2,000,000 Algerians were displaced or forcibly resettled during the war.\n\n[193]\n\nOther French crimes included deliberate bombing, torture and mutilation of civilians, imprisonment\n\nwithout food\n\nin small cells, throwing prisoners\n\nout of helicopters to their death\n\nor into the sea with concrete on their feet, and\n\nburying people alive\n\n.\n\n[194]\n\n[195]\n\n[196]\n\n[197]\n\nThe FLN also indulged in a large amount of atrocities, both against French\n\npieds-noirs\n\nand against fellow Algerians whom they deemed as supporting the French or simply as refusing to support the Liberation effort.\n\n[198]\n\nThese crimes included killing unarmed children, women and the elderly, rape and\n\ndisembowelment\n\nor decapitation of women and murdering children by slitting their throats or banging their heads against walls..\n\n[199]\n\nFrench sources estimated that 70,000 Muslim civilians were killed, or abducted and presumed killed, by the FLN during the war. The FLN also killed 30,000 to 150,000 in people in post-war reprisals.\n\n[200]\n\n1955\u20131975: Vietnam War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nVietnam War \u00a7\u00a0War crimes\n\nSee

August 1965 Lcpl McGhee of Company M, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines , walked through Marine lines at Chu Lai Base Area  toward a nearby village. In answer to a Marine sentry's shouted question, he responded that he was going after a VC. Two Marines were dispatched to retrieve McGhee and as they approached the village they heard a shot and a woman's scream and then saw McGhee walking toward them from the village. McGhee said he had just killed a VC and other VC were following him. At trial Vietnamese prosecution witnesses testified that McGhee had kicked through the wall of the hut where their family slept. He seized a 14-year-old girl and pulled her toward the door. When her father interceded, McGhee shot and killed him. Once outside the house the girl escaped McGhee with the help of her grandmother. McGhee was found guilty of unpremeditated murder and sentenced him to confinement at hard labor for ten years. On appeal this was reduced to 7 years and he actually served 6 years and 1 month.[201]  :33\u20134 | \n|                           Xuan Ngoc (2) |                         Murder and rape |                                                                                                                            PFC John D. Potter, Jr.Hospitalman John R. BretagPFC James H. Boyd, Jr.Sergeant Ronald L. Vogel | On 23 September 1966, a nine-man ambush patrol from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines , left Hill 22, northwest of Chu Lai. Private First Class John D. Potter, Jr. took effective command of the patrol. They entered the hamlet of Xuan Ngoc (2) and seized Dao Quang Thinh, whom they accused of being a Viet Cong, and dragged him from his hut. While they beat him, other patrol members forced his wife, Bui Thi Huong, from their hut and four of them raped her. A few minutes later three other patrol members shot Dao Quang Thinh, Bui, their child, Bui's sister-in-law, and her sister in- law's child. Bui Thi Huong survived to testify at the courts-martial. The company commander suspicious of the reported \"enemy contact\" sent Second Lieutenant Stephen J. Talty, to return to the scene with the patrol. Once there, Talty realized what had happened and attempted to cover up the incident. A wounded child was discovered alive and Potter bludgeoned it to death with his rifle. Potter was convicted of premeditated murder and rape, and sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life, but was released in February 1978, having served 12 years and 1 month. Hospitalman John R. Bretag testified against Potter and was sentenced to 6 month's confinement for rape. PFC James H. Boyd, Jr., pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 4 years confinement at hard labor. Sergeant Ronald L. Vogel was convicted for murder of one of the children and rape and was sentenced to 50 years confinement at hard labor, which was reduced on appeal to 10 years, of which he served 9 years. Two patrol members were acquitted of major charges, but were convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and sentenced to 6 months' confinement. Lt Talty was found guilty of making a false report and dismissed from the Marine Corps, but this was overturned on appeal.[201]  :53\u20134  [202] | \n| Charles W. Keenan and Stanley J.

Allen led a 6-man ambush patrol from the 1st Battalion, 27th Marines  near Hu\u1ebf. They stopped and interrogated 2 unarmed Vietnamese men who Allen and Private Martin R. Alvarez then executed. After an attack on their base that night the unit sent out a patrol who brought back 3 Vietnamese men. Allen, Alvarez, Lance Corporals John D. Belknap, James A. Maushart, PFC Robert J. Vickers, and two others then formed a firing squad and executed 2 of the Vietnamese. The third captive was taken into a building where Allen, Belknap, and Anthony Licciardo, Jr., hanged him, when the rope broke Allen cut the man's throat, killing him. Allen pleaded guilty to five counts of unpremeditated murder and was sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life reduced to 20 years in exchange for the guilty plea. Allen's confinement was reduced to 7 years and he was paroled after having served only 2 years and 11 months confinement. Maushart pleaded guilty to one count of unpremeditated murder and was sentenced to 2 years confinement of which he served 1 year and 8 months. Belknap and Licciardo each pleaded guilty to single murders and were sentenced to 2 years confinement. Belknap served 15 months while Licciardo served his full sentence. Alvarez was found to lack mental responsibility and found not guilty. Vickers was found guilty of 2 counts of unpremeditated murder, but his convictions were overturned on review [201]  :111\u20134 | \n|   Ronald J. Reese and Stephen D.

The four shouted their discovery to those being observed by the ambush. Seized by the Marines, the four were bound, gagged, and led away by Corporal Ronald J. Reese and Lance Corporal Stephen D. Crider. Minutes later, the 4 children were seen, apparently dead, in a small bunker. The Marines tossed a fragmentation grenade into the bunker, which then collapsed the damaged structure atop the bodies. Reese and Crider were each convicted of 4 counts of murder and sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life.

With 1\u20133 million people killed in nine months, 'genocide' is the term that is used to describe the event in almost every major publication and newspaper.[243]  [244]   Although the word 'genocide' was and is still used frequently amongst observers and scholars of the events that transpired during the 1971 war, the allegations that a genocide took place during the Bangladesh War of 1971 were never investigated by an international tribunal set up under the auspices of the United Nations, due to complications arising from the Cold War. A process is underway in 2009\u20132010 to begin trials of some local war collaborators. | \n|                Civilian Casualties |                                                                                           War crimes |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      no prosecutions |                                                                      The number of civilians that died in the liberation war of Bangladesh is not known in any reliable accuracy.

This is the figure officially maintained by the Government of Bangladesh.

The exact numbers are not known and are a subject of debate. Bangladeshi sources cite a figure of 200,000 women raped, giving birth to thousands of war-babies. Some other sources, for example Susan Brownmiller , refer to an even higher number of over 400,000. Pakistani sources claim the number is much lower, though having not completely denied rape incidents.[250]  [251]  [252] | \n|           Killing of intellectuals |                                                                                           War crimes |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      no prosecutions |                                                                                                                                 During the war, the Pakistan Army and its local supporters carried out a systematic execution of the leading Bengali intellectuals.

It isn't just in Congo that trade-offs are being made. [...] Skeptics point out that those who have stood trial so far have either been defeated in war or are retired and irrelevant.

In particular:\n\n1 \u00a0 \u00a0does not represent the entire life cycle analysis (LCA) or supply chain of livestock products, notably omitting carbon dioxide production in respiration (on average 4.8 tons CO2 e/year/cow, 2.3 CO2 e/year/pig, etc.), provides no consideration for increased indirect radiative effects of methane on atmospheric aerosols and particulate capture related to smog (Shindell et al. 2009), and manages land use changes (LUC) with admitted \u201cuncertainty\u201d and under-counting/reporting\n\n2 \u00a0 \u00a0ultimately defers to a separate category for reporting of greenhouse gas emissions related to \u201cdeforestation\u201d (20% of global GHG emissions per UN-REDD), of which livestock and feed crops play a significant role, needing to be added to direct emissions (80% of Amazonian rainforest deforestation and degradation, and destruction of Cerrado savanna since 1970 has been due to expansion for cattle, with another 10% loss due to planting crops to feed them and other livestock)\n\n3 \u00a0 \u00a0the global warming potential (GWP) for methane used in this report was from IPCC 2007, which was 21 at 100 years. However, the GWP of methane is actually 86 GWP at 20 years\n\n4 \u00a0 \u00a0the report gave no consideration to carbon sequestration potential lost on land now used for livestock and feed production, which should have been considered as emissions (45% of the land mass on Earth now used by livestock and crops to feed them\u2013International Livestock Research Institute)\n\n5 \u00a0 \u00a0Consideration should be given to the fact that the lead authors have potential bias in this report; Pierre Gerber is the Livestock Policy Officer of the FAO and Henning Steinfeld is Chief,\u00a0Livestock Information of the Livestock Sector Policy Branch of the FAO. There is little doubt why obvious omissions were therefore seen in their conclusions presented: \u201c\n\nThe global livestock sector is faced with a three-fold challenge: increasing production to meet demand, adapting to a changing and increasingly variable economic and natural environment and, lastly, improving its environmental performance.\n\n\u201c\n\nThis FAO report failed to represent urgency in regard to climate change and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, performed no analysis of alternatives, and failed to present risks versus benefits of raising livestock on a global scale.\n\n1 \u00a0 \u00a0there was no consideration of the effects of raising livestock on continued warming, acidification, deoxygenation and therefore diminished climate regulatory mechanisms of our oceans or time lines related to potential detrimental effects on the oxygen-nitrogen-carbon dioxide cycling capacities.\n\n2 \u00a0 \u00a0the report gave no account for anthropogenic greenhouse gases generated by agricultural systems related to extraction or raising and eating fish\u2013fuel, refrigeration, packaging, processing, transportation, etc. for both wild caught operations as well as those pertaining to aquaculture/aquaponics/aeroponics, which would thereby provide a more accurate and complete agricultural portrait related to our food choices making it easier for policy makers and consumers to interpret the data and findings\n\n3 \u00a0 \u00a0there is no discussion, in an overview sense, to provide clarity regarding the component this happens to represent in livestock\u2019s role, or food choice for that matter, in our current state of un-sustainability and the interrelated issues we face\u2013freshwater scarcity, collapse of sea life oceanic ecosystems, unprecedented extinctions and loss of biodiversity, food security and agricultural land use inefficiencies,\n\nimplications in human health and disease\n\n, rising health care costs and loss of productivity, economic risk factors, questions of social justice and implications regarding future generations, etc. (many of these issues are irreversible in our lifetime)\u2013all part of the task of basic but thorough environmental scientific assessment, perhaps beyond the scope of livestock researchers/proponents for this one report, but the critical connection and relevance are vital should have been mentioned, nevertheless.It is quite clear by this report, which presents a filtered and quite limited view of the role of livestock in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and global depletion, that our team should focus our attention on\n\nwhy\n\nthere is suppression of information, lack of clarity, or elucidation of facts by our leaders related to the overarching problem of animal based agriculture as a component of food choice\u2013and then how to swiftly correct this. Global governmental institutions such as the United Nations and its FAO should examine all the facts and present them accordingly as they interrelate. Then, they should be able to call for the frank elimination (or comprehensive \u201creplacement\u201d) of imminent threats to our survival such as food choices and agricultural systems that are disease promoting, ecologically unsustainable, and which condone massive unnecessary slaughtering\u2013rather than calling for their perpetuation.\n\n[.i] Some have challenged that the 18% of GHG emissions from animal ag cannot be compared to the 13% of GHG for transportation emissions because it does not take into consideration the full lifecycle analysis of the transportation industry. We have made it clear in the film that 13% of GHG emissions only accounts for the exhaust from the worlds vehicles.\n\n[ii]\u00a0Although there are Cornell studies citing the water consumption of the US livestock industry at over\n\n66 trillion gallons every year\n\n, we decided to go with a much more conservative figure of 34 trillion gallons based off the 2005 USGS figures putting the US total consumptive water use at\n\n76 trillion gallons annually\n\n(non-consumptive is for thermoelectric and hydroelectric use that is typically returned directly back to its source immediately). The USDA says that agriculture is responsible for\n\n80-90 percent of US water consumption\n\nand growing the feed crops for livestock consumes\n\n56% of that water\n\n, bringing the total water consumption of the livestock industry to 34 trillion gallons.\n\n[iii]\u00a01 burger = 2 months showering: based on taking a 4-minute daily shower with a 2.5 gpm shower head.\n\n[iv]\u00a0\u201cA typical five-acre hog waste lagoon releases 15-30 tons of ammonia into the air annually. Approximately half of the ammonia rises as a gas and generally falls to forests, fields, or open water within 50 miles, either in rain or fog. The rest is transformed into dry particles that travel up to 250 miles.\n\nAmmonia is the most potent form of nitrogen that triggers algae blooms and causes fish kills in coastal waters. The North Carolina Division of Water Quality estimates that hog factories constitute the largest source of airborne ammonia in North Carolina, more than cattle, chickens, and turkeys combined. In 1995, Hans Paerl, a marine ecologist from the University of North Carolina, reported that airborne ammonia had risen 25% each year since 1991 in Morehead City, 90 miles downwind of the hog belt.\u201d\n\n[v]\u00a0-Dairy Cows,\n\n120 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 9.32 million\n\ndairy cows\n\n-Cows,\n\n63 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 83.68 million\n\ncows\n\n-Calves,\n\n30 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 34.3 million\n\ncalves\n\n-Pigs,\n\n14 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 74 million\n\npigs\n\n-Sheep and Goats,\n\n5 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 7.84 million\n\nsheep and goats\n\n-Turkeys,\n\n.87 lbs. of waster per day\n\nx 77 million\n\nturkeys\n\n-Broiler Chickens,\n\n.50 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 1.74 billion\n\nbroiler chickens\n\n-Laying Hens,\n\n.25 lbs. of waster per day\n\nx 350.7 million\n\nlaying hens\n\n*pigs are raised twice per year, (a total of 148.3 million per year) so on any given day in the United States there are about 74 million pigs.\n\n*turkeys are raised three times per year (a total of 233 million per year) so on any given day in the United States there are 77 million turkeys.\n\n*broiler chickens are raised 5 times per year, (a total of 8.69 billion per year) so any given day there are1.74 billion broiler chickens.\n\nDairy Cows produce (120 lbs. x 9.32 m.) = 1.1184 billion lbs.\n\nCows produce (63 lbs. x 83.68 m.) = 5.27184 billion lbs.\n\nCalves produce (30 lbs. x 34.3 m.) = 1.029 billion lbs.\n\nPigs produce (14 lbs. x 74.0 m.) = 1.036 billion lbs.\n\nSheep and Goats produce (5 lbs. x 7.84 m.) = 39.2 million lbs.\n\nTurkeys produce (.87 lbs. x 77.0 m.) = 66.99 million lbs.\n\nBroiler Chickens produce (.5 x 1.74 b.) = 870 million lbs.\n\nLaying Hens produce (.25 x 350.7 m.) = 87.675 million lbs.\n\n*Total manure produced in one day is 9.519105 billion lbs.\n\n*Total manure produced in one year is 3.475 trillion lbs.\n\n*This is the equivalent of over 6.611 million lbs. per minute. (This does not include any animal raised outside of USDA Jurisdiction, backyards or fish raised for aquaculture)\n\n[vi]\u00a0Enough waste to cover, etc: based on 1 pound of waste per 1 square foot of land\n\n\u201cAnimal farms produce as much manure as small and medium sized cities. A farm with 2500 dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of 411,000 people.\u201d\n\nOn a 1000-pound live weight basis, each of these animals produces more waste than a human. A CAFO with 1000 animal units of turkeys produces a waste load comparable to a city of 87,700 people. A dairy CAFO with 1000 animal units is equivalent to a city of 164,500 people. The important difference lies in the fact that human waste is treated before discharge into the environment, but animal waste is either not treated at all or minimally treated by virtue of the storage methods used before disposal.\u201d\n\nhttp://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901V0100.txt\n\n[vii]\u00a0Additionally \u2013 Oppenlander says 1-2 trillion fish extracted (inc. \u201cbycatch,\u201d) from our oceans each year (\u201cby fishing methods such as trawling, purse seine, long lines, explosives, and other techniques that are damaging ecosystems\u201d)\n\nhttp://comfortablyunaware.com/blog/biodiversity-and-food-choice-a-clarification/\n\n[viii]\u00a0The figures for by-kill rates can be as high as 20lbs of untargeted species trapped for every pound of targeted animals killed.\n\n[ix]\u00a0\u201cThe USDA currently forecasts 2013/14 palm oil production\u2026total area devoted to oil palm plantings is estimated at a record 10.8 million hectares.\u201d [26.7 million acres]\n\n[x]\u00a0\u201c[Dorothy Stang\u2019s] death prompted Amazon activists \u2013 more than 1,000 of whom have been murdered in the last 20 years \u2013 to demand Brazil\u2019s government crack down on the illegal seizure and clearance of the rainforest to graze cattle, raise soy crops, and harvest timber.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than 1,100 activists, small farmers, judges, priests and other rural workers have been killed in land disputes in the last two decades.\u201d\n\n[xi]\u00a0A single cow can produce between 66-132 gallons of methane a day. The average US vehicle gas tank can hold about 16 gallons of gas.\n\n[xii]\u00a0\u201cThe US meat industry produced some 1.4 billion tons of waste in 1997\u2014 five tons of animal waste for every US citizen. (USDA)\u201dhttp://www.worldwatch.org/fire-grill-mouthwatering-red-white-and-green-july-4th\n\n[xiv]\u00a0The average person in the U.S. uses 405,000 gallons of freshwater per year (combination of the subfractions which comprise 206 pounds of meat per year\u2013 divided between 46 pounds of pig, 58 pounds of cow, 102 pounds of chicken and turkey in addition to 248 eggs and 616 pounds of dairy products), which equates to saving 1,100 gallons of water each day.\n\n\u2013 45lbs of grain saved per day: Grain: multiply ounces of each meat consumed daily per person by the feed conversion factor for each animal.\n\n\u2013 It is estimated that 80,000 acres of rainforest are cleared each day with an additional 80,000 degraded, with\n\n70-91% of that degradation for the livestock industry\n\n.\n\n\u2013 CO2 based of feed conversion ratios and the average US meat consumption of 209lbs per year, per person.\n\nBeef is at 22-27 kg CO2 Eq per kg produced/consumed X 2.5 ounces/day=1.75 kgor 3.85 pounds\n\nCheese/milk is 13.5 kg per kg product X 2 pounds/day=12.15 kg or 12.5 pounds\n\nPork is 12 kg per kg product X 2 ounces/day=.68 kg or 1.5 pounds\n\nCombination chicken and turkey is 7 kg per kg product X 4.48 ounces/day= .89 kg or 1.96 pounds minimally (using only chicken)\n\n{turkey, for instance, is 11 kg per kg product}\n\nEggs are at 5 kg per kg product X 2/3 egg per day= (50 g/egg) .55 pounds\n\n\u2014\u00a0which equals 20.36 pounds of CO2 Eq saved per day.\n\n[xv] An important distinction must be made between water \"use\" and \"consumption\".\u00a0Hydroelectric power is one of the largest \"users\" of water in the US, but actually consumes very little water. The water is used to power turbines or for cooling and is almost always returned to the source immediately. Agriculture is the largest \"consumer\" of water because it pulls water from the source and locks it up in products, not returning it to the source immediately, if ever.\n\n[xvi] \u00a0$414 billion of externalized costs breaks down to:\u00a0$314 billion in health-care costs,\u00a0$38 billion in subsides,\u00a0$37 billion in environmental costs,\u00a0$21 billion in cruelty costs,\u00a0$4 billion in fishing-related costs.

Additionally, using any agricultural database regionally, nationally, or internationally, one can calculate that on average between 10 times and 100 times (in weight) more plant foods (vegetables, fruit, grain/nuts) on one acre of land than from animal products raised on that same acre of land, regardless of the level of fertility of that particular acre of land, presuming it is the same acre used for either product, animal or plant based.\n\n[xviii]\u00a0Many organizations are studying humanity\u2019s effect on soil degradation, erosion, and eventual desertification but not willing to emphasize the final connection of dots to animal agriculture. According to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), nearly 20 million acres of arable land is lost each year due to desertification and the primary reasons are:\n\n1. deforestation due to cultivation of crops and pasture\n\n2. overgrazing from livestock (\u201ceating away grasses and eroding topsoil with hooves\u201d)\n\n3. intensive farming stripping away nutrients in soil\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml\n\nOvergrazing by livestock is the principal land problem related to desertification as indicated in the article:\n\nhttp://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html\n\nAnd, according to the UNDDD: \u201cNearly 20% of the degrading land (globally) is cropland, and 20-25%, rangeland.\u201d Understanding that over 70% of the global arable land used for agriculture is planted for crops grown for livestock, there is be ample support for the statement that \u201canimal agriculture is the leading driver for approximately 1/3 of the land lost on earth due to desertification.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml\n\n[xix]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Few prominent scientists will openly proclaim the connection of their research findings with the need to eliminate animal agriculture or promotion of fully plant based nutrition. This is an observation that spans all aspects of global depletion related to food choice, including the topic of loss of biodiversity and extinction of species.\n\nThe statement that animal agriculture is the primary driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of species is supported by many discussions and interviews with leading authors and scientists working for the Convention of Biodiversity and IUCN as well as publications regarding current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook.\n\nMost organizations that associate their work with species and ecosystem/biodiversity concerns as well as the scientific community as a whole believe that the six main threats to our oceans are climate change, overfishing, predator loss, pollution, destruction of habitat, and bycatch, (\u201cbykill\u201d).\n\n(For instance: The Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union and the Convention on Biological Diversity).\n\nAs of August 2012, the 2004 Global Species Assessment was the most recent empirical data on global extinction rates, based on birds, mammals, and amphibians. According to an interview conducted by Dr. Oppenlander with Simon Stuart, PhD, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission:\n\n\u201cHabitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species, impacting 86 percent of all mammals, 88 percent of amphibians, and 86 percent of all birds. One in every eight birds, one in every three amphibians, and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future. Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction, such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land, globally.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction.\n\nScientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial \u201cecoregions\u201d (as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions), each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species, as well as climate. Of all these land ecoregions, almost half are reported by lead scientists (interviews/discussions) to have livestock as a current threat. The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that \u201cmost of the world\u2019s endangered or threatened species\u201d on their Red List (which lists the species that are most endangered) are suffering habitat loss due to livestock\u2014not due to agriculture but to livestock.\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met. The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species\u2014habitat change, overexploitation, pollution, invasive species, and climate change\u2014were all increasing in intensity.\n\nCurrent biodiversity assessments (as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook) now generally agree that land use change,\u00a0modification of river flow, freshwater pollution, and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species.\u00a0Because more than 50% of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock (ILRI), 70 to 90% of freshwater pollution in western countries (particularly the U.S. and China) can be traced back to animal agriculture, minimally 14.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions/climate change, and 100% of \u201cexploitation of marine environments\u201d is related to the global commercial fishing industry, it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that \u201cthe primary driver of global species\u2019 extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture.\u201d\n\n[xx] The amount of water, land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed, amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised.\u00a0Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat, the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods. The same applies for land and oil use. Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50+ acre per cow, compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50,000lbs+ per acre.\u00a0The energy/fuel inputs are similar. 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans.\n\nxxi (New) As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67,027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45,000. However the BLM considers the amount of wild horses and burros on the range too populated and will attempt to remove 40,000 to bring the level back to what is considered by the BLM the 'acceptable level'\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates from A.U.M.

The estimated value of Iran's real estate in the U.S. and their accumulated rent is $50 million.\n\n[1]\n\nBesides the assets frozen in the U.S., some parts of Iran's assets are frozen around the world by the\n\nUnited Nations\n\n.\n\n[1]\n\nAs of January 2021, Iran had frozen assets in the following countries: $7 billion in South Korea; $6 billion in Iraq; $20 billion in China; $1.5 billion in Japan; 1.6 billion in Luxembourg.\n\n[6]\n\nContents\n\n1\n\nBackground\n\n2\n\nAfter nuclear negotiations\n\n3\n\nSeizure of Iranian assets\n\n4\n\nSee also\n\n5\n\nReferences\n\nBackground\n\nEdit\n\nIran's assets were first\n\nfrozen\n\nby\n\nU.S. president\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nin 1979, after revolutionaries\n\noverthrew\n\nthe U.S.-allied\n\nMohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi\n\n's administration and\n\ntook American hostages\n\n. After the\n\nIranian Revolution\n\nin 1979, the United States ended its\n\neconomic and diplomatic ties with Iran\n\n, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately 11 billion 1980-US dollars of its assets.\n\n[7]\n\nMany of the assets were then unfrozen in 1981 after the\n\nAlgiers Accords\n\nwere signed and the hostage crisis ended.\n\n[\n\ndubious\n\n\u2013\n\ndiscuss\n\n]\n\nAt the time of the 1979 revolution, the Pentagon re-sold some $400 million in Iranian military equipment already paid for by the deposed government, and the money was \"placed in an escrow account\".\n\n[1]\n\nMuch of the frozen cash includes Iran's income from selling a limited amount of\n\noil\n\nprior to the lifting of the sanctions, when Iran could legally sell oil but could not transfer the money back to Iran, because doing so was illegal under U.S. sanctions.\n\n[2]\n\nAfter nuclear negotiations\n\nEdit\n\nSome pages of the\n\nJCPOA\n\nwere dedicated to the listing of individuals and entities whose assets would be unfrozen.\n\n[1]\n\nAccording to\n\nNader Habibi\n\n, a professor of economics at\n\nBrandeis University\n\n, JCPOA will lead to the release of only about $30 billion worth of assets; a similar figure of about $32 billion was estimated by\n\nValiollah Seif\n\n, the chief of\n\nIran's central bank\n\n.\n\n[2]\n\nAccording to the\n\nWashington Institute\n\nin 2015:\n\n[8]\n\n\"...the\n\npre-deal\n\nasset freeze did not have as great an impact on the\n\nIranian government\n\nas some statements from Washington suggested. And going forward, the post-deal relaxation of restrictions will not have as great an impact as some critics of the deal suggest.\"\n\nThe US government also has\n\nseized a Manhattan skyscraper belonging to the Iranian government\n\nworth over a billion US dollars.\n\nSeizure of Iranian assets\n\nEdit\n\nMain article:\n\nBank Markazi v. Peterson\n\nDeborah Peterson and other plaintiffs brought a lawsuit in\n\nU.S. federal court\n\nagainst the Islamic Republic of Iran, and obtained a\n\njudgments\n\nagainst Iran for its role in the\n\n1983 Beirut barracks bombings\n\n(in which 241\n\nMarines\n\nwere killed) and for other acts of\n\ninternational terrorism\n\n. While foreign states usually enjoy immunity from claims in court, the plaintiffs invoked an exception to the\n\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976\n\nthat allows foreign states to be held liable for acts of\n\nstate-sponsored terrorism\n\n.\n\n[9]\n\nThe central bank of Iran,\n\nBank Markazi\n\n, challenged the execution of the judgment on various grounds. However, in 2012, Congress passed, and President\n\nBarack Obama\n\nsigned, the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which specified that the judgment in the\n\nPeterson et al. v. Islamic Republic of Iran et al.\n\nwould be subject to execution and also abolished Bank Markazi to the execution of judgment.\n\n[9]\n\nBank Markazi challenged this statute as unconstitutional, arguing that Congress had unduly interfered with a judicial function by intervening in a specific case; however, the\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\n, in\n\nBank Markazi v. Peterson\n\n, ruled 7-2 that Congress's act was constitutional.\n\n[9]\n\nIran had denied any involvement in any of the bombings.\n\n[10]\n\nIranian president\n\nHassan Rouhani\n\ncalled the action \"blatant robbery\".\n\n[11]\n\nSee also\n\nEdit\n\nSanctions against Iran\n\nReferences\n\nEdit\n\n^\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\ne\n\nGarver, Rob.\n\n\"Here's what's in Iran's $100 billion in assets that will become unfrozen by the nuclear deal\"\n\n.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\n.

Image: Getty\n\nStacked Farm, an Australian automated vertical indoor farm, has received international interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about the continuity of food supplies.\n\nThe farm produces salad greens and has the capacity for tomatoes and strawberries.\n\nCEO Conrad Smith told Business Insider Australia Stack Farm received significant interest from the Middle East.\n\nVisit Business Insider Australia\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nAussie company Stacked Farm, a fully automated vertical indoor farm, has been gaining international interest amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStacked Farm, founded in 2017, produces salad greens and herbs like lettuce and rocket, and has the capacity tp produce tomatoes and strawberries. It\u2019s even looking at testing out a type of blueberry next year.\n\nThe company has been receiving a lot of interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about virus clusters breaking out in the food supply chain. Back in May, a coronavirus cluster broke out at Melbourne\u2019s Cedar Meats abattoir, which was linked to 62 cases,\n\naccording to the ABC\n\n.\n\n\u201cPeople are more concerned than ever about who is handling their food, where it\u2019s coming from and how many stops it made before arriving on supermarket shelves,\u201d Stacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith said in a statement.\n\nThe company is headquartered in Burleigh Heads, Queensland and has plans to open up farms across Australia as well. \u201cA scaled-up farm in Victoria will be our first major commercial farm,\u201d Smith told Business Insider Australia. Its farm is fully automated, with the produce packed and sealed once its harvested by robotic farming.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pass through the usual supply chains either \u2013 greens and herbs can go directly to wholesalers, retails, hotels and restaurants, unlike traditional produce which passes through a number of hands before reaching our shelves,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\nStacked Farm has a partnership with fresh produce supplier Morco Fresh and counts Dnata as one of its clients as well, which provides aircraft services like flight catering.\n\n\u201cWe are not too dissimilar to a normal farm where we go through markets and we go through wholesalers and food service distributors,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAnd while it mainly supplies to the food service industry, Stacked Farm is looking at a move into retail so people can grab its produce from supermarket shelves as well. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the capacity to do that at the moment,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut when we scale up to our Victorian farm, we will certainly have the capacity to do that and we\u2019ll be looking for retail partners to jump on the journey that we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nThe farms are temperature controlled and automated\n\nStacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith. Image: Troy Archer\n\nStacked Farm grows its produce 12 months a year, without relying on different seasons. Its products are grown in a temperature-controlled environment that is fully automated from seeding to harvesting. The company is looking at post-harvest automation as part of its next business phase.\n\nStacked Farm also makes barley-based livestock feed. \u201cIn a drought-vulnerable country like Australia, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there because while we all think about human consumption, animals are a massive part of the food chain that needs to be considered,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe company\u2019s employees are mainly in the science and tech field rather than traditional farm labourers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not like traditional farms where we require pickers, packers and harvesters,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe employ more labour leaning towards engineering, software engineering, mechanical engineering, CAD designers [and] horticultural scientists.\u201d\n\nThe company has been receiving interest from the Middle East\n\nStacked Farm has received international interest in its farm during the coronavirus pandemic, mainly thanks to concerns over food safety, quality and security.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of food chains that have been broken throughout this COVID-19 pandemic, and we\u2019ve had interest from the Middle East to set up farms there,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cWe have been very enthused by the interest from particularly a couple of states in the Middle East that have governments that really support local industry and local farming.\u201d Smith gave the example of Dubai which relies predominantly on imports.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\n\n, the United Arab Emirates imports up to 90% of its food.\n\nSmith explained that in Dubai, \u201ca lot of produce can\u2019t travel by sea\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve immediately recognised that there\u2019s a problem in their food chain and they need to bring tech businesses to their country to support feeding their people.\u201d And, in the case of Stacked Farm, can help feed livestock too.\n\nSmith added that Stacked Farm can support the future of food production, particularly in extremely hot and dry or extremely cold climates. He explained that\n\none in nine people go hungry\n\naround the world.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations\n\n, by 2050 world food demand is expected to rise by 70%.\n\n\u201cHaving urban indoor vertical farms is definitely [an] exciting prospect for the future,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe can literally shave days off out of the logistics process, we can extend the shelf life of products so there\u2019s less wastage and that in turn will benefit the community.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on\n\nFacebook\n\n,\n\nTwitter\n\n,\n\nLinkedIn\n\n, and\n\nInstagram\n\n.\n\nTagged In\n\naustralian stories\n\ncoronavirus\n\nfood chain\n\nqueensland\n\nstacked farm\n\nBusiness Insider Research\n\nI adopted a dog in 2020, and this handheld vacuum cleaner helped me keep fur off every surface in my house\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nBusiness Insider Australia\n\nContact Editor\n\nGot A Story Tip?\n\nReport Issue\n\nBusiness Insider Video\n\nA company in Uganda is turning the waste from bananas into rugs, place mats, and baskets\n\nHow metalworkers in India are keeping the 600-year-old craft of Bidri art alive\n\nPopular on Facebook\n\nDoing these 24 uncomfortable things will pay off forever\n\nYes, Apple just killed iTunes \u2014 here's what that means for your library of music, movies, and TV shows\n\nWe took a 4-hour flight on the new Delta Airbus jet that Boeing tried to keep out of the US.

I rescheduled my piece on contact tracing\u2019s potential to further empower the surveillance state for next year\u2019s first Black Agenda Report and instead updated my 2015 piece \u201c\n\nSamantha Power: Africa\u2019s Problem from Hell\n\n.\u201d\n\nAs I said then, when Power was serving the second of her four years as President Obama\u2019s US Ambassador to the UN,\u00a0she was on a mission to save Africans from African savagery, but her largesse extends to all those who need American bombs to calm ethnic strife. She wants you to call\n\n1-800-GENOCIDE\n\n, so she can alert the president to send in the Marines or other US Special Forces. As head of USAID, she\u2019ll be in perfect position to wield foreign aid as a cudgel for beating foreign heads of state till they line up behind US empire, which she understands as a never-ending campaign to stop genocide and defend human rights.\n\nIndeed, Power actually seems to believe this, unlike those who shamelessly invoke human rights but know full well that US foreign policy is about economic exploitation and/or domination of any non-NATO nation that dares to raise an independent head. In \u201c\n\nThe\n\nE\n\nducation of an Idealist: A Memoir\n\n,\u201d published in 2019, she writes of how she all but immolated in her own burning self-righteousness while reporting from Bosnia in the 1990s:\n\n\u201c\n\nI had never been without opinions, but my certitude previously had to do with seemingly trivial issues like an umpire\u2019s bad call in a baseball game. Now, as I researched and reflected on real\n\n\u2010\n\nworld events, I seemed unable to contain my emotions or modulate my judgments. If the subject of Bosnia came up and someone innocently described the conflict as a civil war, I would erupt: It is genocide!\u201d\n\nAntiwar activist and writer David Swanson wrote one of my favorite headlines of 2017:\n\nSamantha Power Can See Russia from Her Padded Cell\n\n. In the Counterpunch piece, he shared highlights of Power\u2019s overwrought\n\nperformance\n\nat the Atlantic Council where she railed at Russia for aggression threatening the US and the global rule of law, in Ukraine, Syria, France, Germany, Montenegro and beyond, and demanded that NATO be on hair-trigger alert.\n\nPadded cell indeed. On December 14,\n\nCNN\n\nPentagon correspondent reported that a Russian missile drill had just triggered a false alarm at a US military base in Germany, and I can only assume that Samantha Power was reassured that they\u2019re locked and loaded with all the latest world-ending nuclear weapons. If anyone knows of a psychological professional\u2019s analysis of Power\u2019s mind as publicly manifest, please send it to me at the e-address in my bio tag at the bottom of this article.\n\nDavid Swanson also cited William Blum\u2019s list of US attempts to overthrow governments (asterisks where successful), none of which soften Power\u2019s missionary zeal:\n\nChina 1949 to early 1960s\n\nAlbania 1949-53\n\nEast Germany 1950s\n\nIran 1953 *\n\nGuatemala 1954 *\n\nCosta Rica mid-1950s\n\nSyria 1956-57\n\nEgypt 1957\n\nIndonesia 1957-58\n\nBritish Guiana 1953-64 *\n\nIraq 1963 *\n\nNorth Vietnam 1945-73\n\nCambodia 1955-70 *\n\nLaos 1958 *, 1959 *, 1960 *\n\nEcuador 1960-63 *\n\nCongo 1960 *\n\nFrance 1965\n\nBrazil 1962-64 *\n\nDominican Republic 1963 *\n\nCuba 1959 to present\n\nBolivia 1964 *\n\nIndonesia 1965 *\n\nGhana 1966 *\n\nChile 1964-73 *\n\nGreece 1967 *\n\nCosta Rica 1970-71\n\nBolivia 1971 *\n\nAustralia 1973-75 *\n\nAngola 1975, 1980s\n\nZaire 1975\n\nPortugal 1974-76 *\n\nJamaica 1976-80 *\n\nSeychelles 1979-81\n\nChad 1981-82 *\n\nGrenada 1983 *\n\nSouth Yemen 1982-84\n\nSuriname 1982-84\n\nFiji 1987 *\n\nLibya 1980s\n\nNicaragua 1981-90 *\n\nPanama 1989 *\n\nBulgaria 1990 *\n\nAlbania 1991 *\n\nIraq 1991\n\nAfghanistan 1980s *\n\nSomalia 1993\n\nYugoslavia 1999-2000 *\n\nEcuador 2000 *\n\nAfghanistan 2001 *\n\nVenezuela 2002 *\n\nIraq 2003 *\n\nHaiti 2004 *\n\nSomalia 2007 to present\n\nHonduras 2009\n\nLibya 2011 *\n\nSyria 2012\n\nUkraine 2014 *\n\nAfrica\u2019s Problem from Hell\n\nIn my 2015 piece on Samantha Power, I focused on her human rights rage in Africa. Having successfully advocated for US-led NATO wars in Libya and Syria \u201cto stop the next Rwanda,\u201d she then had her sights set on the tiny, impoverished East African nation of Burundi, which had dared to\n\ncontract\n\nwith a majority Russian firm to mine its nickel and form strategic alliances with Russia and China. Wikileaks\u2019 diplomatic cables reveal that Western interests had had their eyes on\n\nBurundi\u2019s nickel\n\nfor decades before its government, under the late President Pierre Nkurunziza, signed with the Russian firm, which they said had offered better terms.\n\nBurundi shares the Hutu-Tutsi-Twa ethnic divisions with neighboring Rwanda and a highly geostrategic border with the resource rich Democratic Republic of Congo. Power, along with Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth, was stridently warning that Burundian President Nkurunziza and his political party were plotting Tutsi genocide.\n\nPower shrieked for regime change, but Russia and China had Burundi\u2019s back on the UN Security Council (UNSC), and it survived to celebrate its\n\nremoval\n\nfrom the UNSC\u2019s \u201cagenda\u201d this month, which means that its sovereignty is now relatively secure, and there was no new genocide.\n\nMuch of Power\u2019s career is based on her historically inaccurate, decontextualized and grossly oversimplified account of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, during which, she alleges, the US \u201cstood by.\u201d From that point on, she moralizes, US citizens must be \u201cupstanders,\u201d not bystanders. \u201cNever again\u201d can we fail in our moral duty to stop the world\u2019s backward peoples from massacring one another over ethnic difference. She wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \u201c\n\nThe Problem From Hell: America in the Age of Genocide\n\n,\u201d in which she expands on her Atlantic article on Rwanda, \u201c\n\nBystanders to Genocide,\n\n\u201d and calls America to arms.\n\n\u201cPower shrieked for regime change, but Russia and China had Burundi\u2019s back on the UN Security Council.\u201d\n\nPower fails to note that the US stood by intentionally, not indifferently, in Rwanda, until US ally Gen. Paul Kagame won a war of aggression begun four years earlier. The Rwandan death toll was many hundreds of thousands higher than the Pentagon had projected, but otherwise, everything went according to plan. Two years later, the Congo Wars began, and the US and UK unseated France as the dominant power in the African Great Lakes Region.\n\nUS troops now appear only as \u201cadvisors\u201d south of the Sahara, although \u201c\n\nMass Atrocities Prevention, a Military Planning Handbook\n\n\u201d describes the swift, surgical deployment of US Special Forces as a blueprint at the ready. For now there are plenty of African troops serving under US military command and grateful to receive the salaries that boost their class status in Africa, though they\u2019d be considered poverty wages here. In 2011, President Obama appointed Power to head his\n\nMass Atrocities Review Board\n\n.\n\nAll but a few African nations now have soldiers serving within\n\nAFRICOM, the US Africa Command\n\n, and Burundi\u2019s belligerent neighbor Rwanda is one of the greatest troop contributors. One complication of the Burundian situation is that Burundian troops serve in\n\nAM\n\nISON\n\n, the Pentagon-led African Union Mission to Somalia.\n\nFighting and casualties had already taken place on Burundi\u2019s tense border with Rwanda in 2015, and five of Burundi\u2019s ruling party leaders, including the Burundian security and intelligence chief, were assassinated. This made it clear that President Nkurunziza, who was hugely popular with the country\u2019s rural Hutu peasant majority, could be the next target.\n\nThat greatly alarmed all those who remember that the assassination of three Hutu presidents within two years, 1993-1994, precipitated the Rwandan and Burundian bloodbaths of the 1990s. Samantha Power decried the assassinations on both sides in Burundi and threatened sanctions, but she laid all the blame for the Burundian crisis on President Nkurunziza. Why? Because he had claimed the constitutional right to be elected twice by universal suffrage, then won by 69 percent.\n\nHowever, she spoke not a word of protest in 2010, when Rwandan President Paul Kagame claimed the same right and won by a thoroughly implausible 93 percent majority. Or in 2011, when President Kabila claimed the same right, then claimed a victory that\n\n\"\n\nd\n\nelegitimized all Congolese institutions,\" according to the Carter Center\u2019s election observer mission\n\n.\n\nThe regional and ethnic tensions, which were then most fiercely focused on Burundi, are real and the mass violence often horrifying, but the world\u2019s industrial and military power elites are always in play behind the news and Samantha Power\u2019s latest African anxieties, however righteously and rabidly she conceives them.\n\nAnn Garrison is an independent journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

By altering the levels of future global greenhouse gas emissions and/or the levels of adaptation, you can see how vulnerability to food insecurity changes over time, and compare and contrast these different future scenarios with each other and the present day.\n\nSEE THE POSSIBILITIES\n\nFor the interactive experience, visit the site on your tablet or desktop browser\n\nLAUNCH INTERACTIVE MAP\n\nREPLAY VIDEO\n\nSorry; your browser doesn't support HTML5 video in WebM with VP8 or MP4 with H.264.\n\nINTERACTIVE MAP\n\nPlease view in landscape\n\nABOUT\n\n\u00d7\n\nAbout\n\nBackground Science\n\nMet Office\n\nWorld Food Programme\n\nMade possible through the generous contribution of:\n\nLegal disclaimer\n\n: the designations employed and the presentation of material in the map(s) do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the World Food Programme (WFP) or Met Office concerning the legal or constitutional status of any country, territory, or sea area, or concerning the delimitation of frontiers.\n\nBackground science\n\nThis website allows you to explore how different scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to climate change could change the geography of food insecurity in developing and least-developed countries. The website maps an index of vulnerability to food insecurity at national level. This is calculated based on exposure to climate-related hazards, sensitivity of agricultural production to those hazards, and the capacity of countries to cope with climate-related food shocks. By altering the levels of future global greenhouse gas emissions and/or the levels of adaptation, you can see how vulnerability to food insecurity changes over time, and compare and contrast these different future scenarios with each other and the present day.\n\nVulnerability to food insecurity in the present-day\n\nThe climate and food insecurity index shown on this website is a measure of vulnerability of the food system to climate-related hazards.\n\nVulnerability is calculated at a country level and is comprised of three components:\n\nExposure\n\nto climate-related hazards,\n\nSensitivity\n\nof national agricultural production to climate-related hazards,\n\nAdaptive capacity\n\na measure of capacity to cope with climate-related food shocks.\n\nExposure\n\nThe exposure component of the index is calculated from a measure of the average length of flood and drought events in each country. This is constructed from gridded meteorological data for the baseline period (1981-2010). The exposure is only calculated over areas with a population density greater than 150 people per km2 and/or more than 1% of the area given over to crop production.\n\nSensitivity\n\nThe sensitivity component of the index is calculated using indicators relevant to agricultural production. These are measures of the amount of forest cover, rainfed agriculture and cereal crop yield per country.\n\nAdaptive capacity\n\nThe adaptive capacity component of the index is calculated using socio-economic indicators relevant to the food security system. These are measures of rural and urban populations with access to water resources, the percentage of rural population, population growth rate, population below the poverty line ($2 per day), vulnerable employment, government effectiveness and the number of paved roads per country.\n\nCriteria for inclusion\n\nAll data included in the vulnerability to food insecurity index correlates with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (\n\nFAO\n\n) measure of undernutrition. Vulnerability to food insecurity as a result of weather events is most apparent in developing and least-developed countries, as they rely more heavily on in-country food production compared to the most developed countries which have access to markets. For this reason, OECD and EU countries are not included in the calculation. Small countries (< 500 km2) and those with few people and/or little or no agricultural production are also not included in the calculation.\n\nFuture projections of vulnerability to food insecurity\n\nFuture projections of the climate and food insecurity index have been calculated for a range of scenarios of different future global greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation levels.\n\nGreenhouse gas emission scenarios\n\nThere are three scenarios of future global greenhouse gas emissions to choose from: low, intermediate or high emissions. These three scenarios correspond to climate model projections of the climate system response to three different greenhouse gas concentration pathways:\n\nThe low emissions scenario represents a rapid and sustained reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions resulting in an increase in global average temperature of around 2\u00c2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. This scenario is also known as RCP2.6.\n\nThe intermediate emissions scenario represents a modest reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions resulting in an increase in global average temperature of around 2.5\u00c2\u00b0C - 3\u00c2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. This scenario is also known as RCP4.5.\n\nThe high emissions scenario represents considerable future increases in global greenhouse gas emissions resulting in a rise in global average temperature of 4\u00c2\u00b0C or more above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. This scenario is also known as RCP8.5.\n\nThe climate model projections are used to calculate future projections of the exposure component of the index. Twelve climate models from the latest generation of climate models used to inform the most recent Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC AR5) were used, and the average value of the index for each country across the models is shown.\n\nInformation about the model spread of the results\n\nScenarios of adaptation investment\n\nThere are three scenarios of different adaptation levels to choose from: high, low or no adaptation. The scenarios determine how sensitive agricultural production is to climate-related hazards and the capacity to cope with climate-related food shocks in the future. Applying an adaptation scenario changes the sensitivity and adaptive capacity components of the index.\n\nThe level of change follows standardised scenarios and the change was scaled to allow the most vulnerable countries to improve most relative to the present-day, and the least vulnerable countries to change the least:\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098high\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adaptation scenario corresponds to a change of approximately 10-15% in the 2050s compared to the present-day, and a further change of approximately 10-15% in the 2080s compared to the 2050s.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098low\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adaptation scenario corresponds to a change of approximately 5-10% in the 2050s compared to the present-day, and a further change of approximately 5-10% in the 2080s compared to the 2050s.\n\nThe no adaptation scenario maintains the sensitivity and adaptive capacity components of the index at the present-day level.\n\nTechnical detail about the methodology\n\nMet Office\n\nOur climate is changing. There have been observed increases in global temperatures, reductions in snow and ice and rising sea levels, and humans are responsible for at least half of the observed changes (\n\nIPCC, 2013\n\n).\n\nClimate model projections show further changes to the climate system in years to come; these changes will depend on future concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Climate models project an increase in global average temperature, rising sea levels and changes to the water cycle under every future greenhouse gas concentration pathway. Furthermore, the changes experienced in the near future will be as a result of past emissions of greenhouse gases; this is climate change that we are committed to.\n\nClimate models are used to explore the range of possible responses of the climate system to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. A low greenhouse gas concentration pathway could limit the increase in global average temperature to around 2\u00c2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels; the current target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A high greenhouse gas concentration pathway could see increases of 4\u00c2\u00b0C or more.\n\nThe impacts of a rise in global average temperature will be felt differently at regional and local scales. Increases in extreme temperatures, frequency and severity of floods and droughts and intensity of storms will impact all aspects of human wellbeing, such as access to food and water resources, poverty and health (\n\nIPCC, 2014\n\n).\n\nThe Met Office Hadley Centre undertakes world-leading research in climate science and provides world-class guidance on the science of climate change. Met Office scientists work collaboratively with other organisations and sectors to further understand and communicate the potential impacts of climate change on human well-being, to inform policy makers.\n\nClimate scientists from the Met Office Hadley Centre have worked in collaboration with food security analysts from the\n\nWorld Food Programme\n\nto better understand the relationship between climate change and food insecurity. [\n\nMore information about the relationship between climate change and food insecurity.\n\n]\n\nBy bringing together expertise in climate science and food security the climate and food insecurity index has been developed, which measures vulnerability of the food system to climate-related hazards in developing and least-developed countries. This website allows exploration of possible future projections of the index under a range of climate change and adaptation scenarios; providing policy-relevant human food security outcomes for use in long-term food security adaptation planning.\n\nWorld Food Programme\n\nWFP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision is to eradicate hunger in our lifetime\n\n, a bold aim that is manifested in the Sustainable Development Goals and is at the centre of Agenda 2030.\n\nZero Hunger cannot be achieved without urgent and ambitious action to address the challenge of climate change.\n\nAs the largest agency fighting hunger worldwide, WFP is working to understand the effects of climate change and help food-insecure communities prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate-related disasters. A large part of our work involves helping governments to analyse and understand the links between food security, climate hazards, and climate change so that they can take the necessary actions and investments to eradicate climate-related hunger in their country through more effective policy and programme.\n\nClimate risks today have a disproportionately negative impact on food-insecure people\n\n, 80 percent of whom live in countries that are prone to natural disasters and face high levels of environmental degradation.\n\nClimate change will make these risks worse \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and make the investments needed to achieve \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and maintain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Zero Hunger even greater.\n\nThe Food Insecurity and Climate Change Vulnerability Index offers a window on our global future up to the 2080s, looking at how climate change may affect future vulnerability to food insecurity. Depending on our actions, future generations will inherit a world with less vulnerability than today \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or a world with significantly more vulnerability to food insecurity.  A world where keeping hunger at bay is achievable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or one where we will struggle to keep the scourge of hunger at bay.\n\nWFP believes that hunger can be eradicated by 2030.  But this rigorous scientific analysis presents a sobering picture, showing that climate change is making the task more difficult and costlier. It shows that even after 2030, because of climate change we will need to remain vigilant and continue to invest heavily in adaptation to preserve the gains we make in the next 15 years.\n\nMassive increases in investment are needed to end hunger by 2030 and to enable the poorest people to build resilient livelihoods. But we must do more than simply achieve the SDGs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we must build a world where they are maintained and continue to improve.  To do this, we must make sure we address the causes of climate change and continue to invest in resilience and adaptation after 2030 to protect the gains we will have made.\n\nFind out more about how climate change impacts hunger.\n\n\u00d7\n\nHow it works\n\nExplore future projections of the climate and food insecurity index for a range of scenarios of different future global greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation levels.\n\nEmissions\n\nThere are three global greenhouse gas scenarios to choose from: low, medium or high emissions.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098Low\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scenario is known as RCP2.6, which is equivalent to a rapid and sustained reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098medium\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scenario is known as RCP4.5, which is equivalent to a modest reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098High\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scenario is known as RCP8.5, which is equivalent to a considerable increase in future global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAdaptation\n\nThere are three adaptation levels to choose from: high, low or no adaptation.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u0098High\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scenario improves agricultural sensitivity and adaptive capacity by around 10-15%, per time period. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098Low\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scenario improves these factors by around 5-10%, per time period. The amount of change applied to each country depends on the vulnerability of that country in the present-day. The more vulnerable the country, the larger the change. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098None\u00e2\u0080\u0099 scenario applies no change from the present-day.\n\nSee the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Background Science\u00e2\u0080\u0099 page in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098About\u00e2\u0080\u0099 information tab in the top right corner for more detail about these scenarios and the climate and food insecurity index.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00d7\n\nHow it works\n\nThe present-day measure of vulnerability to food insecurity uses meteorological data for the period 1981-2010 and socio-economic data representative of the year 2010. There are two future time periods to choose from. These represent 30-year averages centred on the 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2100).\n\n\u00d7\n\nHow it works\n\nThis is the colour scale for the climate and food insecurity index measure of vulnerability to food insecurity.\n\n\u00d7\n\n1/5\n\nSelect from the future scenario options.

Here are the top 8.\n\nIn light of the current political crisis in Venezuela, a United States-supported opposition figure has announced a\n\ndisputed\n\npresidency.\n\nIt follows an\n\nattempted\n\ncoup by national guard members after the country\u2019s Supreme Court rejected a declaration by an opposition-controlled legislature that Nicolas Maduro\u2019s presidency was illegitimate.\n\nUS support for the opposition is not new.\n\nIn 2017, then CIA director Mike Pompeo\n\ncommented\n\nthat he was \u201chopeful that there can be a transition in Venezuela and we the CIA is doing its best to understand the dynamic there\u201d.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of US interventions, forced regime change and military coups in Latin America, the CIA director\u2019s words reflect an established approach for the United States in dealing with its southern neighbours, often away from the public eye and motivated by big business, economic interest and ideology.\n\nHere are eight of the most notorious cases of US interference in Latin America.\n\n1. Guatemala\n\nThe United Fruit Company (UFCO) was a highly successful American company that made major profits from bananas grown in Latin America and sold in the United States and Europe. Under Guatemalan dictator Jorge Ubico, the UFCO\n\ncontrolled\n\n42 percent of Guatemala\u2019s land and was exempt from tax and import duties. The company\n\nowned\n\nall of Guatemala's banana production, monopolised banana exports, and also owned the country's telephone and telegraph system, as well as almost all of its railroad track - while brutally repressing farm owners.\n\nIn 1944, the right-wing dictator Ubico was removed following the Guatemalan Revolution, as the country saw its first democratic election in history. In 1951, after another election, Colonel Jacobo Arbez became president and extended political freedoms to all, allowing communists to enter politics.\n\nThe United States was alarmed by the alleged spread of communism, and further by President Arbenz\u2019s\n\nproposed\n\n\u2018Decree 900\u2019, which would allow the redistribution of undeveloped lands held by large property owners to landless farmers, making up 90 percent of the population. Arbenz believed this was critical because at the time only two percent of landowners owned 70 percent of the land, while farmers worked in a form of debt slavery.\n\nThe United Fruit Company took an extreme position towards these reforms, and made use of its\n\nstrong ties\n\nto the Eisenhower administration to launch a massive anti-communist propaganda campaign against Guatemala.\n\nFollowing extensive lobbying, President Eisenhower chose to make use of the CIA to remove President Arbenz, in what came to be known as operation\n\nPBSUCCESS\n\n.\n\nThe CIA would go on to\n\norchestrate\n\na coup against the sitting president, building, arming and training an opposition force to overthrow him.\n\nArbenz was overthrown, and Guatemala was ruled by a military dictatorship for 40 years. During that time, nearly 250,000 Guatemalans were\n\nkilled\n\nor \u2018disappeared\u2019.\n\n2. Chile\u2019s brutal Pinochet regime\n\nAfter the democratic election of President Salvador Allende, who had ties to the Cuban Castro government, in 1970, US President Richard Nixon\n\nordered\n\nan economic war against Chile. This would be followed by a CIA-instigated\n\ncoup\n\nagainst Allende in 1973 by General Augusto Pinochet.\n\nFollowing the coup, Pinochet\u2019s regime would become one of the most oppressive and brutal military regimes of the 20th Century.\n\nThe US\n\nsupported\n\nPinochet\u2019s military dictatorship for decades. Pinochet banned political parties, dissolved congress and scrapped the constitution. He also censored the press, banned unions, permitted torture and repression, and according to one government report,\n\nkilled\n\nnearly 28,000 people during his rule.\n\n3. Invasion of Grenada\n\nGrenada is a small Caribbean island 150 km north of Venezuela. In 1979, a revolution led by Maurice Bishop\n\nsucceeded\n\nwith Cuban support. One of his projects was the construction of a large airstrip, which US President Reagan claimed was designed for Soviet aircraft.\n\nDuring an internal power struggle, while 800 US medical students were on the island, Reagan used the unrest as justification for ordering an invasion. On October 25, 1983, 10,000 US, Jamaican and Caribbean troops\n\ninvaded\n\nthe island, in a move that killed over 100 civilians and was condemned internationally by the UN General Assembly.\n\n4. Panama\n\nBefore Panama sought independence from Greater Colombia, the Colombian government was\n\nnegotiating\n\nwith the US to build a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. With the failure of negotiations, the US supported a separatist movement in Panama.\n\nOnce the country gained independence, French businessman Phillip Burnau-Varilla\n\nsold\n\nhis rights to building the Panama Canal to the US government. As a result, the US demanded full control of the canal and a 9.7 km zone around it.\n\nIn the 1970s, the CIA would go on to\n\nrecruit\n\nGeneral Manuel Noriega, who had previously run the country\u2019s secret police until his president\u2019s sudden death in a plane crash. He\n\nwent on\n\nto help Colombian drug trafficker Pablo Escobar smuggle cocaine, as well as helping the US smuggle weapons to Nicaraguan Contra death squads in what would later come to be known as the\n\nIran-Contra affair\n\n.\n\nIt was only when Noriega outlived his usefulness that he would be\n\noverthrown\n\nby the US in 1990, and arrested for corruption, racketeering and drug smuggling.\n\n5. Nicaragua\n\nThe US\n\noccupied\n\nNicaragua in 1912, going on to acquire rights to build a supposed \u2018Nicaragua Canal\u2019 from the US-backed Chamorro family. General Augusto Sandino led a rebellion against the conservative government and US occupation. Sandino was later assassinated and followed by the US-backed Somoza dictatorship.\n\nNot long after, the Sandinista revolution\n\noverthrew\n\nthe US-backed Somoza dictatorship and faced off against the US-sponsored Contra guerrilla rebels. This would later be publicised as the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nIn a\n\nblack book\n\noperation during the Reagan administration in 1985, the US sold 1,500 missiles to Iran in exchange for seven American hostages. Much of the $30 million paid by Iran for the weapons went to fund the Contras.\n\n6. Argentina\n\nIn 1976, Argentina\u2019s democratically elected President Isabel Peron was overthrown in a military coup d\u2019etat that lead to the deaths of nearly 30,000. The coup was supported and endorsed by the\n\nUnited States\n\ngovernment, with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger going to\n\nvisit\n\nthe newly-installed dictatorship several times.\n\nThe US-endorsed dictatorship committed grievous human rights violations while in power. Crimes included mass execution, extrajudicial arrest, torture and rape, as well as the\n\nrelocation\n\nof children born of pregnant detainees (before imprisonment, after continuous rape). Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon would later rule that Kissinger was a\n\nwitness\n\nto such crimes.\n\n7. Brazil\n\nIn 1964, President John F. Kennedy backed a coup d\u2019etat against Brazilian President Joao Goulart, \u201cto\n\nprevent\n\nBrazil from becoming another Cuba\u201d. Brazil\u2019s return to democracy would see several right-wing hardliner governments come to power, resulting in deep inequality and extreme\n\npoverty\n\nfor the country that continues to affect it to the present day.\n\n8. Cuba\n\nIn exchange for Cuba\u2019s independence, the US\n\nforced\n\nthe newly-independent nation to include the Platt Amendment in its new constitution. The\n\nPlatt Amendment\n\nprevented Cuba from leasing land to any country but the US, allowed for US intervention in Cuban affairs, and forbade it from negotiating any treaties with anyone but the US.\n\nThe Platt Amendment would also set the\n\nbasis\n\nfor leasing Guantanamo Bay to the US, allowing them to carry out extrajudicial torture on foreign soil.\n\nIn 1959, Fidel Castro\n\noverthrew\n\nthe US-backed military Batista government in power, causing alarm in the US over his explicit communist agenda and links to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Batista government\n\nopened\n\nHavana to US investment and tax refuge, exploitative tourism, organised crime syndicates and drugs, and announced that it would match, dollar for dollar, any investment over $1 million USD.\n\nPresident Eisenhower would oversee plans to overthrow Castro with the same model used in Guatemala, eventually\n\nimplemented\n\nby President Kennedy. In 1961,\n\nCIA-trained\n\nanti-Castro exiles landed in the Bay of Pigs, supported by US strikes on Cuban airfields.\n\nCastro\u2019s communist government was well\n\nequipped\n\nwith Soviet weapons, and defeated the invasion, which would lead to the notorious Cuban Missile Crisis stand-off the following year as the world came dangerously close to outright nuclear war.\n\nSource: TRT World\n\nAUTHOR\n\nAdam Bensaid\n\n@AdamABensaid\n\nAdam Bensaid is a deputy producer at TRT World.\n\nRelated News\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Guaido released after brief arrest\n\nPipe bomb package addressed to CNN in Atlanta intercepted\n\nPence aide testifies in Trump impeachment inquiry, Bolton a no-show\n\nThousands take to streets in the US to rally against gun-violence\n\nCategory News\n\nUS expresses concerns over Russia-Ukraine military tensions\n\nBiden unveils 'once-in-a-generation' $2T infrastructure investment plan\n\nUN envoy calls for action to prevent looming 'civil war' in Myanmar\n\nStore cashier expresses 'disbelief, guilt' over George Floyd's death\n\nVenezuela\n\nAmericas\n\nNorthern America\n\nUnited States of America\n\nSouth America\n\nBACK\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Guaido released after brief arrest\n\nPipe bomb package addressed to CNN in Atlanta intercepted\n\nPence aide testifies in Trump impeachment inquiry, Bolton a no-show\n\nThousands take to streets in the US to rally against gun-violence\n\nTrump blames Democrats for migrant 'caravan' without providing any proof\n\nBACK\n\n1\n\nUnited Airlines to hire 300 new pilots as air travel rebounds\n\n2\n\nChild among mass shooting victims in California\n\n3\n\nTwo Capitol police officers sue Trump over January 6 siege\n\n4\n\nSpaceX Mars rocket prototype breaks apart during test flight\n\n5\n\nFormer Minneapolis cop's trial in George Floyd's murder gets underway\n\nBACK\n\nShow people, places and other topics in this story\n\nRead articles related to this story\n\nSee what's popular on TRT World\n\nCLOSE\n\nWhat would you like to learn?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words.

The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant.\n\nOverall equation for the type of photosynthesis that occurs in plants\n\nComposite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis, including both oceanic\n\nphytoplankton\n\nand terrestrial\n\nvegetation\n\n. Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land, respectively.\n\nPhotosynthesis\n\nis a process used by plants and other organisms to\n\nconvert\n\nlight energy\n\ninto\n\nchemical energy\n\nthat, through\n\ncellular respiration\n\n, can later be released to fuel the organism's metabolic activities. This chemical energy is stored in\n\ncarbohydrate\n\nmolecules, such as\n\nsugars\n\n, which are synthesized from\n\ncarbon dioxide\n\nand\n\nwater\n\n\u2013 hence the name\n\nphotosynthesis\n\n, from the\n\nGreek\n\nph\u014ds\n\n(\n\n\u03c6\u1ff6\u03c2\n\n), \"light\", and\n\nsunthesis\n\n(\n\n\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\n\n), \"putting together\".\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nIn most cases,\n\noxygen\n\nis also released as a waste product. Most\n\nplants\n\n,\n\nalgae\n\n, and\n\ncyanobacteria\n\nperform photosynthesis; such organisms are called\n\nphotoautotrophs\n\n. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the\n\noxygen content\n\nof the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for\n\nlife\n\non Earth.\n\n[4]\n\nAlthough photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by\n\nproteins\n\ncalled\n\nreaction centers\n\nthat contain green\n\nchlorophyll\n\npigments. In plants, these proteins are held inside\n\norganelles\n\ncalled\n\nchloroplasts\n\n, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the\n\nplasma membrane\n\n. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip\n\nelectrons\n\nfrom suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced\n\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate\n\n(NADPH) and\n\nadenosine triphosphate\n\n(ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, long-term energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of\n\nlight-independent\n\nreactions called the\n\nCalvin cycle\n\n. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is\n\nincorporated\n\ninto already existing organic carbon compounds, such as\n\nribulose bisphosphate\n\n(RuBP).\n\n[5]\n\nUsing the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then\n\nreduced\n\nand removed to form further carbohydrates, such as\n\nglucose\n\n. In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the\n\nreverse Krebs cycle\n\nare used to achieve the same end.\n\nThe first photosynthetic organisms probably\n\nevolved\n\nearly in the\n\nevolutionary history of life\n\nand most likely used\n\nreducing agents\n\nsuch as\n\nhydrogen\n\nor\n\nhydrogen sulfide\n\n, rather than water, as sources of electrons.\n\n[6]\n\nCyanobacteria appeared later; the\n\nexcess oxygen\n\nthey produced contributed directly to the\n\noxygenation of the Earth\n\n,\n\n[7]\n\nwhich rendered the\n\nevolution of complex life\n\npossible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130\n\nterawatts\n\n,\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\nwhich is about eight times the current\n\npower consumption of human civilization\n\n.\n\n[11]\n\nPhotosynthetic organisms also convert around 100\u2013115 billion\n\ntons\n\n(91\u2013104\n\npetagrams\n\n) of carbon into\n\nbiomass\n\nper year.\n\n[12]\n\n[13]\n\nThe phenomenon that plants receive some energy from light \u2013 in addition to air, soil, and water \u2013 was first discovered in 1779 by\n\nJan Ingenhousz\n\n.\n\nContents\n\n1\n\nOverview\n\n2\n\nPhotosynthetic membranes and organelles\n\n3\n\nLight-dependent reactions\n\n3.1\n\nZ scheme\n\n3.2\n\nWater photolysis\n\n4\n\nLight-independent reactions\n\n4.1\n\nCalvin cycle\n\n4.2\n\nCarbon concentrating mechanisms\n\n4.2.1\n\nOn land\n\n4.2.2\n\nIn water\n\n5\n\nOrder and kinetics\n\n6\n\nEfficiency\n\n7\n\nEvolution\n\n7.1\n\nSymbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts\n\n7.2\n\nPhotosynthetic eukaryotic lineages\n\n7.3\n\nCyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis\n\n8\n\nDiscovery\n\n8.1\n\nDevelopment of the concept\n\n8.2\n\nC3\u00a0: C4 photosynthesis research\n\n9\n\nFactors\n\n9.1\n\nLight intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature\n\n9.2\n\nCarbon dioxide levels and photorespiration\n\n10\n\nSee also\n\n11\n\nReferences\n\n12\n\nFurther reading\n\n12.1\n\nBooks\n\n12.2\n\nPapers\n\n13\n\nExternal links\n\nOverview\n\nPhotosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O\n\n2\n\n, and fixes CO\n\n2\n\ninto sugar.\n\nPhotosynthetic organisms are\n\nphotoautotrophs\n\n, which means that they are able to\n\nsynthesize\n\nfood directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis;\n\nphotoheterotrophs\n\nuse organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.\n\n[4]\n\nIn plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called\n\noxygenic photosynthesis\n\nand is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in\n\nplants\n\n,\n\nalgae\n\n, and\n\ncyanobacteria\n\n, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of\n\nanoxygenic photosynthesis\n\n, used mostly by certain types of bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.\n\nCarbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called\n\ncarbon fixation\n\n; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into\n\ncarbohydrate\n\n. Carbon fixation is an\n\nendothermic\n\nredox\n\nreaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of\n\ncellular respiration\n\n: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrate or other\n\nnutrients\n\nto carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's\n\nmetabolism\n\n. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different\n\ncellular compartments\n\n.\n\nThe general\n\nequation\n\nfor photosynthesis as first proposed by\n\nCornelis van Niel\n\nis therefore:\n\n[14]\n\nCO\n\n2\n\ncarbon\n\ndioxide\n\n+\n\n2H\n\n2\n\nA\n\nelectron donor\n\n+\n\nphotons\n\nlight energy\n\n\u2192\n\n[CH\n\n2\n\nO]\n\ncarbohydrate\n\n+\n\n2A\n\noxidized\n\nelectron\n\ndonor\n\n+\n\nH\n\n2\n\nO\n\nwater\n\nSince water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:\n\nCO\n\n2\n\ncarbon\n\ndioxide\n\n+\n\n2H\n\n2\n\nO\n\nwater\n\n+\n\nphotons\n\nlight energy\n\n\u2192\n\n[CH\n\n2\n\nO]\n\ncarbohydrate\n\n+\n\nO\n\n2\n\noxygen\n\n+\n\nH\n\n2\n\nO\n\nwater\n\nThis equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the\n\nlight-dependent reaction\n\nand a product of the\n\nlight-independent reaction\n\n, but canceling\n\nn\n\nwater molecules from each side gives the net equation:\n\nCO\n\n2\n\ncarbon\n\ndioxide\n\n+\n\nH\n\n2\n\nO\n\nwater\n\n+\n\nphotons\n\nlight energy\n\n\u2192\n\n[CH\n\n2\n\nO]\n\ncarbohydrate\n\n+\n\nO\n\n2\n\noxygen\n\nOther processes substitute other compounds (such as\n\narsenite\n\n) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to\n\narsenate\n\n:\n\n[15]\n\nThe equation for this reaction is:\n\nCO\n\n2\n\ncarbon\n\ndioxide\n\n+\n\n(AsO\n\n3\u2212\n\n3\n\n)\n\narsenite\n\n+\n\nphotons\n\nlight energy\n\n\u2192\n\n(AsO\n\n3\u2212\n\n4\n\n)\n\narsenate\n\n+\n\nCO\n\ncarbon\n\nmonoxide\n\n(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)\n\n[16]\n\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage,\n\nlight-dependent reactions\n\nor\n\nlight reactions\n\ncapture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules\n\nATP\n\nand\n\nNADPH\n\n. During the second stage, the\n\nlight-independent reactions\n\nuse these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.\n\nMost organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use\n\nvisible light\n\nfor the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave\n\ninfrared\n\nor, more specifically, far-red radiation.\n\n[17]\n\nSome organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some\n\narchaea\n\nuse a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The\n\nbacteriorhodopsin\n\nchanges its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.\n\n[18]\n\n[19]\n\nPhotosynthetic membranes and organelles\n\nMain articles:\n\nChloroplast\n\nand\n\nThylakoid\n\nChloroplast ultrastructure\n\n:\n\nouter membrane\n\nintermembrane space\n\ninner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)\n\nstroma (aqueous fluid)\n\nthylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)\n\nthylakoid membrane\n\ngranum (stack of thylakoids)\n\nthylakoid (lamella)\n\nstarch\n\nribosome\n\nplastidial DNA\n\nplastoglobule (drop of lipids)\n\nIn photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in\n\ncell membranes\n\n. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself.\n\n[20]\n\nHowever, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called\n\nthylakoids\n\n,\n\n[21]\n\nor bunched up into round\n\nvesicles\n\ncalled\n\nintracytoplasmic membranes\n\n.\n\n[22]\n\nThese structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.\n\n[21]\n\nIn plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in\n\norganelles\n\ncalled\n\nchloroplasts\n\n. A typical\n\nplant cell\n\ncontains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and\n\nperipheral membrane protein\n\ncomplexes of the photosynthetic system.\n\nPlants absorb light primarily using the\n\npigment\n\nchlorophyll\n\n. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as\n\ncarotenes\n\nand\n\nxanthophylls\n\n.\n\n[23]\n\nAlgae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as\n\nphycocyanin\n\n,\n\ncarotenes\n\n, and\n\nxanthophylls\n\nin\n\ngreen algae\n\n,\n\nphycoerythrin\n\nin\n\nred algae\n\n(rhodophytes) and\n\nfucoxanthin\n\nin\n\nbrown algae\n\nand\n\ndiatoms\n\nresulting in a wide variety of colors.\n\nThese pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a\n\nlight-harvesting complex\n\n.\n\n[24]\n\nAlthough all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called\n\nleaves\n\n. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and\n\naridity\n\n, such as many\n\nEuphorbia\n\nand\n\ncactus\n\nspecies, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the\n\nmesophyll\n\n, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant\n\nwaxy\n\ncuticle\n\nthat protects the leaf from excessive\n\nevaporation\n\nof water and decreases the absorption of\n\nultraviolet\n\nor\n\nblue\n\nlight\n\nto reduce\n\nheating\n\n. The transparent\n\nepidermis\n\nlayer allows light to pass through to the\n\npalisade\n\nmesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.\n\nLight-dependent reactions\n\nMain article:\n\nLight-dependent reactions\n\nLight-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane\n\nIn the\n\nlight-dependent reactions\n\n, one molecule of the\n\npigment\n\nchlorophyll\n\nabsorbs one\n\nphoton\n\nand loses one\n\nelectron\n\n. This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called\n\npheophytin\n\n, which passes the electron to a\n\nquinone\n\nmolecule, starting the flow of electrons down an\n\nelectron transport chain\n\nthat leads to the ultimate reduction of\n\nNADP\n\nto\n\nNADPH\n\n. In addition, this creates a\n\nproton gradient\n\n(energy gradient) across the\n\nchloroplast membrane\n\n, which is used by\n\nATP synthase\n\nin the synthesis of\n\nATP\n\n. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called\n\nphotolysis\n\n, which releases a\n\ndioxygen\n\n(O\n\n2\n\n) molecule as a waste product.\n\nThe overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:\n\n[25]\n\n2 H\n\n2\n\nO + 2 NADP\n\n+\n\n+ 3 ADP + 3 P\n\ni\n\n+ light \u2192 2 NADPH + 2 H\n\n+\n\n+ 3 ATP + O\n\n2\n\nNot all\n\nwavelengths\n\nof light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of\n\naccessory pigments\n\npresent. For example, in green plants, the\n\naction spectrum\n\nresembles the\n\nabsorption spectrum\n\nfor\n\nchlorophylls\n\nand\n\ncarotenoids\n\nwith absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the\n\nlight spectrum\n\nis what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.\n\nZ scheme\n\nThe \"Z scheme\"\n\nIn plants,\n\nlight-dependent reactions\n\noccur in the\n\nthylakoid membranes\n\nof the\n\nchloroplasts\n\nwhere they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.\n\nIn the non-cyclic reaction, the\n\nphotons\n\nare captured in the light-harvesting\n\nantenna complexes\n\nof\n\nphotosystem II\n\nby\n\nchlorophyll\n\nand other\n\naccessory pigments\n\n(see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called\n\nphotoinduced charge separation\n\n. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an\n\nelectron transport chain\n\n(the so-called\n\nZ-scheme\n\nshown in the diagram), it initially functions to generate a\n\nchemiosmotic potential\n\nby pumping proton cations (H\n\n+\n\n) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An\n\nATP synthase\n\nenzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during\n\nphotophosphorylation\n\n, whereas\n\nNADPH\n\nis a product of the terminal\n\nredox\n\nreaction in the\n\nZ-scheme\n\n. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in\n\nPhotosystem I\n\n. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that\n\nphotosystem\n\n. The electron is then passed along a chain of\n\nelectron acceptors\n\nto which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H\n\n+\n\nto NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.\n\nThe cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name\n\ncyclic reaction\n\n.\n\nWater photolysis\n\nMain articles:\n\nPhotodissociation\n\nand\n\nOxygen evolution\n\nLinear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of\n\nphotosystem I\n\nare replaced by transfer from\n\nplastocyanin\n\n, whose electrons come from electron transport through\n\nphotosystem II\n\n. Photosystem II, as the first step of the\n\nZ-scheme\n\n, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll\n\na\n\nreaction center, called P680. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic\n\noxygen\n\nand four\n\nhydrogen\n\nions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active\n\ntyrosine\n\nresidue that then reduces the oxidized P680. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is\n\ncatalyzed\n\nin photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four\n\nmanganese\n\nions and a calcium ion; this\n\noxygen-evolving complex\n\nbinds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Dolai's S-state diagrams). Photosystem II is the only known biological\n\nenzyme\n\nthat carries out this oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for\n\ncellular respiration\n\n, including photosynthetic organisms.\n\n[26]\n\n[27]\n\nLight-independent reactions\n\nCalvin cycle\n\nMain articles:\n\nLight-independent reactions\n\nand\n\nCarbon fixation\n\nIn the\n\nlight-independent\n\n(or \"dark\") reactions, the\n\nenzyme\n\nRuBisCO\n\ncaptures\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nfrom the\n\natmosphere\n\nand, in a process called the\n\nCalvin cycle\n\n, it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is\n\n[25]\n\n:\n\n128\n\n3 CO\n\n2\n\n+ 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H\n\n+\n\n\u2192 C\n\n3\n\nH\n\n6\n\nO\n\n3\n\n-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 P\n\ni\n\n+ 6 NADP\n\n+\n\n+ 3 H\n\n2\n\nO\n\nOverview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation\n\nCarbon fixation\n\nproduces the intermediate three-carbon sugar product, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic compounds, such as the building material\n\ncellulose\n\n, the precursors for\n\nlipid\n\nand\n\namino acid\n\nbiosynthesis, or as a fuel in\n\ncellular respiration\n\n. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in\n\nanimals\n\nwhen the energy from plants is passed through a\n\nfood chain\n\n.\n\nThe fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which\n\ncarbon dioxide\n\ncombines with a five-carbon sugar,\n\nribulose 1,5-bisphosphate\n\n, to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound,\n\nglycerate 3-phosphate\n\n, also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of\n\nATP\n\nand\n\nNADPH\n\nproduced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to\n\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate\n\n. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (\n\nPGAL\n\n) or, more generically, as\n\ntriose\n\nphosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus \"recycled\" often condense to form\n\nhexose\n\nphosphates, which ultimately yield\n\nsucrose\n\n,\n\nstarch\n\nand\n\ncellulose\n\n. The sugars produced during carbon\n\nmetabolism\n\nyield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of\n\namino acids\n\nand\n\nlipids\n\n.\n\nCarbon concentrating mechanisms\n\nOn land\n\nMain articles:\n\nC4 carbon fixation\n\n,\n\nCAM photosynthesis\n\n, and\n\nAlarm photosynthesis\n\nOverview of\n\nC4 carbon fixation\n\nIn hot and dry conditions, plants close their\n\nstomata\n\nto prevent water loss. Under these conditions,\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nwill decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of\n\nphotorespiration\n\nby the\n\noxygenase\n\nactivity of\n\nribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase\n\nand decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have\n\nevolved\n\nmechanisms to increase the\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nconcentration in the leaves under these conditions.\n\n[28]\n\nPlants that use the\n\nC\n\n4\n\ncarbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule\n\nphosphoenolpyruvate\n\n(PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called\n\nPEP carboxylase\n\n, creating the four-carbon organic acid\n\noxaloacetic acid\n\n. Oxaloacetic acid or\n\nmalate\n\nsynthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized\n\nbundle sheath\n\ncells where the enzyme\n\nRuBisCO\n\nand other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nreleased by\n\ndecarboxylation\n\nof the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon\n\n3-phosphoglyceric acids\n\n. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nfixation and, thus, the\n\nphotosynthetic capacity\n\nof the leaf.\n\n[29]\n\nC\n\n4\n\nplants can produce more sugar than C\n\n3\n\nplants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are C\n\n4\n\nplants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called\n\nC\n\n3\n\nplants\n\nbecause the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C\n\n3\n\ncarbon fixation, compared to 3% that use C\n\n4\n\ncarbon fixation;\n\n[30]\n\nhowever, the evolution of C\n\n4\n\nin over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of\n\nconvergent evolution\n\n.\n\n[28]\n\nXerophytes\n\n, such as\n\ncacti\n\nand most\n\nsucculents\n\n, also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called\n\nCrassulacean acid metabolism\n\n(CAM). In contrast to C\n\n4\n\nmetabolism, which\n\nspatially\n\nseparates the\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nfixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM\n\ntemporally\n\nseparates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C\n\n3\n\nplants, and fix the\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nat night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nmostly in the form of\n\nmalic acid\n\nvia carboxylation of\n\nphosphoenolpyruvate\n\nto oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases\n\nCO\n\n2\n\ninside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. Sixteen thousand species of plants use CAM.\n\n[31]\n\nCalcium oxalate\n\naccumulating plants, such as\n\nAmaranthus hybridus\n\nand\n\nColobanthus quitensis\n\n,\n\nshowed a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate\n\ncrystals\n\nfunction as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide (\n\nCO\n\n2\n\n) to photosynthetic cells when\n\nstomata\n\nare partially or totally closed. This process was named\n\nAlarm photosynthesis\n\n. Under stress conditions (e.g. water deficit) oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO\n\n2\n\nby an\n\noxalate oxidase\n\nenzyme\n\nand the produced CO\n\n2\n\ncan support the\n\nCalvin cycle\n\nreactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (\n\nH\n\n2\n\nO\n\n2\n\n), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by\n\ncatalase\n\n. Alarm photosynthesis represents an unknown photosynthetic variation to be added to the already known\n\nC4\n\nand\n\nCAM\n\npathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere.\n\n[32]\n\n[33]\n\nIn water\n\nCyanobacteria\n\npossess\n\ncarboxysomes\n\n, which increase the concentration of\n\nCO\n\n2\n\naround RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme,\n\ncarbonic anhydrase\n\n, located within the carboxysome releases CO\n\n2\n\nfrom the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO\n\n\u2212\n\n3\n\n). Before the CO\n\n2\n\ndiffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO, which is concentrated within the carboxysomes. HCO\n\n\u2212\n\n3\n\nions are made from CO\n\n2\n\noutside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO\n\n2\n\nvery slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO\n\n\u2212\n\n3\n\nions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes.\n\n[34]\n\nPyrenoids\n\nin\n\nalgae\n\nand\n\nhornworts\n\nalso act to concentrate\n\nCO\n\n2\n\naround RuBisCO.\n\n[35]\n\nOrder and kinetics\n\nThe overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:\n\n[13]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Stage |                                                            Description |                  Time scale | \n|     1 |           Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll (thylakoid membranes) |  femtosecond  to picosecond | \n|     2 | Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions (thylakoid membranes) |   picosecond  to nanosecond | \n|     3 |       Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (thylakoid membranes) | microsecond  to millisecond | \n|     4 |                          Carbon fixation and export of stable products |      millisecond  to second | \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEfficiency\n\nMain article:\n\nPhotosynthetic efficiency\n\nPlants usually convert light into\n\nchemical energy\n\nwith a\n\nphotosynthetic efficiency\n\nof 3\u20136%.\n\n[36]\n\nAbsorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1\u20132%)\n\n[37]\n\nre-emitted as\n\nchlorophyll fluorescence\n\nat longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.\n\n[37]\n\nActual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%.\n\n[38]\n\nBy comparison,\n\nsolar panels\n\nconvert light into\n\nelectric energy\n\nat an efficiency of approximately 6\u201320% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices.\n\nThe efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured but the relationship between the two can be complex.\n\n[39]\n\nFor example, the ATP and NADPH energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C\n\n3\n\nplants.\n\n[39]\n\nElectrons may also flow to other electron sinks.\n\n[40]\n\n[41]\n\n[42]\n\nFor this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.\n\n[43]\n\n[44]\n\n[45]\n\nChlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and Infrared gas analyzers can  measure the dark reaction.\n\n[46]\n\nIt is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together.\n\n[47]\n\nInfrared gas analyzers and some  moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO\n\n2\n\n, and of \u0394H\n\n2\n\nO using reliable methods\n\n[48]\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nis commonly measured in \u03bcmols/(m\n\n2\n\n/s), parts per million or volume per million and H\n\n2\n\nO is commonly measured in mmol/(m\n\n2\n\n/s) or in mbars.\n\n[48]\n\nBy measuring CO\n\n2\n\nassimilation, \u0394H\n\n2\n\nO, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes possible to estimate, \"A\" or carbon assimilation, \"E\" or transpiration, \"gs\" or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO\n\n2\n\n.\n\n[48]\n\nHowever, it is more common to used chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used measuring parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM' can be made in a few seconds, allowing the measurement of larger plant populations.\n\n[45]\n\nGas exchange systems that offer control of CO\n\n2\n\nlevels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO\n\n2\n\nlevels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response.\n\n[48]\n\nIntegrated chlorophyll fluorometer \u2013 gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms.\n\n[46]\n\n[47]\n\nWhile standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO\n\n2\n\nlevels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of C\n\nC\n\nto replace Ci.\n\n[47]\n\n[49]\n\nThe estimation of CO\n\n2\n\nat the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, or C\n\nC\n\n, becomes possible with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or g\n\nm\n\nusing an integrated system.\n\n[46]\n\n[47]\n\n[50]\n\nPhotosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf. But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO\n\n2\n\nassimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength-dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.\n\n[51]\n\nA phenomenon known as\n\nquantum walk\n\nincreases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an algae, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called\n\nchromophores\n\narranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a\n\nquasiparticle\n\nreferred to as an\n\nexciton\n\n, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously \"choose\" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time.\n\nBecause that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic \"hop\". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.\n\n[52]\n\n[53]\n\n[54]\n\nEvolution\n\nMain article:\n\nEvolution of photosynthesis\n\nLife timeline\n\nThis box:\n\nview\n\ntalk\n\nedit\n\n\u22124500\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u22124000\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u22123500\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u22123000\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u22122500\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u22122000\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u22121500\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u22121000\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2212500\u00a0\u2014\n\n\u2013\n\n0\u00a0\u2014\n\nWater\n\nSingle-celled\n\nlife\n\nPhotosynthesis\n\nEukaryotes\n\nMulticellular\n\nlife\n\nArthropods\n\nMolluscs\n\nPlants\n\nDinosaurs\n\nMammals\n\nFlowers\n\nBirds\n\nPrimates\n\n------------------------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest Earth  (\u22124540 ) | \n------------------------------------\n\n------------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest water | \n------------------------\n\n-----------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest life | \n-----------------------\n\n------------------------\n| \u2190 | LHB meteorites | \n------------------------\n\n-------------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest oxygen | \n-------------------------\n\n----------------------------\n| \u2190 | Atmospheric oxygen | \n----------------------------\n\n-----------------------\n| \u2190 | Oxygen crisis | \n-----------------------\n\n------------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest fungi | \n------------------------\n\n-----------------------------\n| \u2190 | Sexual reproduction | \n-----------------------------\n\n-------------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest plants | \n-------------------------\n\n--------------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest animals | \n--------------------------\n\n-------------------------\n| \u2190 | Ediacaran biota | \n-------------------------\n\n----------------------------\n| \u2190 | Cambrian explosion | \n----------------------------\n\n-------------------\n| \u2190 | Tetrapoda | \n-------------------\n\n-----------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest apes | \n-----------------------\n\nP\n\nh\n\na\n\nn\n\ne\n\nr\n\no\n\nz\n\no\n\ni\n\nc\n\nP\n\nr\n\no\n\nt\n\ne\n\nr\n\no\n\nz\n\no\n\ni\n\nc\n\nA\n\nr\n\nc\n\nh\n\ne\n\na\n\nn\n\nH\n\na\n\nd\n\ne\n\na\n\nn\n\nPongola\n\nHuronian\n\nCryogenian\n\nAndean\n\nKaroo\n\nQuaternary\n\nIce Ages\n\n---------------------------------\n| \u2190 | Earliest multicell life | \n---------------------------------\n\n(\n\nmillion years ago\n\n)\n\nEarly photosynthetic systems, such as those in\n\ngreen\n\nand\n\npurple sulfur\n\nand\n\ngreen\n\nand\n\npurple nonsulfur bacteria\n\n, are thought to have been\n\nanoxygenic\n\n, and used various other molecules than water as\n\nelectron donors\n\n. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used\n\nhydrogen\n\nand\n\nsulfur\n\nas electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various\n\namino\n\nand other\n\norganic acids\n\nas an electron donor. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly\n\nreducing\n\nat\n\nthat time\n\n.\n\n[55]\n\nFossils of what are thought to be\n\nfilamentous\n\nphotosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old.\n\n[56]\n\n[57]\n\nMore recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago.\n\n[58]\n\n[59]\n\nThe main source of\n\noxygen\n\nin the\n\nEarth's atmosphere\n\nderives from\n\noxygenic photosynthesis\n\n, and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the\n\noxygen catastrophe\n\n. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in\n\ncyanobacteria\n\n, became important during the\n\nPaleoproterozoic\n\nera around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is\n\noxidized\n\nto molecular oxygen (\n\nO\n\n2\n\n) in the\n\nphotosynthetic reaction center\n\n.\n\nSymbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts\n\nPlant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss,\n\nPlagiomnium affine\n\n)\n\nSeveral groups of animals have formed\n\nsymbiotic\n\nrelationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in\n\ncorals\n\n,\n\nsponges\n\nand\n\nsea anemones\n\n. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple\n\nbody plans\n\nand large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes.\n\n[60]\n\nIn addition, a few marine\n\nmollusks\n\nElysia viridis\n\nand\n\nElysia chlorotica\n\nalso maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see\n\nKleptoplasty\n\n). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time.\n\n[61]\n\n[62]\n\nSome of the genes from the plant\n\ncell nucleus\n\nhave even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive.\n\n[63]\n\nAn even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular\n\nchromosome\n\n, prokaryotic-type\n\nribosome\n\n, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center.\n\n[64]\n\n[65]\n\nThe\n\nendosymbiotic theory\n\nsuggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by\n\nendocytosis\n\n) by early\n\neukaryotic\n\ncells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like\n\nmitochondria\n\n, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the\n\nnuclear DNA\n\nof their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in\n\ncyanobacteria\n\n.\n\n[66]\n\nDNA in chloroplasts codes for\n\nredox\n\nproteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The\n\nCoRR Hypothesis\n\nproposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.\n\n[67]\n\nPhotosynthetic eukaryotic lineages\n\nSymbiotic and\n\nkleptoplastic\n\norganisms excluded:\n\nThe\n\nglaucophytes\n\nand the\n\nred\n\nand\n\ngreen algae\n\n\u2014clade\n\nArchaeplastida\n\n(unicellular and multicellular)\n\nThe\n\ncryptophytes\n\n\u2014clade\n\nCryptista\n\n(unicellular)\n\nThe\n\nhaptophytes\n\n\u2014clade\n\nHaptista\n\n(unicellular)\n\nThe\n\ndinoflagellates\n\nand\n\nchromerids\n\nin the superphylum\n\nMyzozoa\n\n\u2014clade\n\nAlveolata\n\n(unicellular)\n\nThe\n\nochrophytes\n\n\u2014clade\n\nHeterokonta\n\n(unicellular and multicellular)\n\nThe\n\nchlorarachniophytes\n\nand three species of\n\nPaulinella\n\nin the phylum\n\nCercozoa\n\n\u2014clade\n\nRhizaria\n\n(unicellular)\n\nThe\n\neuglenids\n\n\u2014clade\n\nExcavata\n\n(unicellular)\n\nExcept for the euglenids, all of them belong to the\n\nDiaphoretickes\n\n.

The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the \"red lineages\" and the \"green lineages\". While able to perform photosynthesis, many of them are\n\nmixotrophs\n\nand practice\n\nheterotrophy\n\nto various degrees.\n\nCyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis\n\nThe biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a\n\ncommon ancestor\n\nof extant\n\ncyanobacteria\n\n(formerly called blue-green algae), which are the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis. The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450\u20132320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.\n\n[68]\n\n[69]\n\nBecause the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.\n\n[70]\n\nAvailable evidence from geobiological studies of\n\nArchean\n\n(>2500 Ma)\n\nsedimentary rocks\n\nindicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial\n\nevolution\n\nopened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal\n\nprimary producers\n\nof oxygen throughout the\n\nProterozoic Eon\n\n(2500\u2013543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of\n\nnitrogen fixation\n\n.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nGreen algae\n\njoined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on\n\ncontinental shelves\n\nnear the end of the\n\nProterozoic\n\n, but it was only with the\n\nMesozoic\n\n(251\u201366 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the\n\nprimary production\n\nof oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to\n\nmarine ecosystems\n\nas\n\nprimary producers of oxygen\n\nin oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the\n\nplastids\n\nof marine algae.\n\n[71]\n\nDiscovery\n\nAlthough some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century.\n\nPortrait of\n\nJan Baptist van Helmont\n\nby\n\nMary Beale\n\n, c.1674\n\nJan van Helmont\n\nbegan the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the\n\nmass\n\nof the soil used by a plant and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate \u2013 much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's\n\nbiomass\n\ncomes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.\n\nJoseph Priestley\n\n, a chemist and minister, discovered that, when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar, and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO\n\n2\n\n), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly\n\n\"injure\"\n\nair. He then showed that the air that had been \"injured\" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant.\n\n[72]\n\nIn 1779,\n\nJan Ingenhousz\n\nrepeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.\n\n[72]\n\n[73]\n\nIn 1796,\n\nJean Senebier\n\n, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward,\n\nNicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure\n\nshowed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO\n\n2\n\nbut also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.\n\n[74]\n\nCornelis Van Niel\n\nmade key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction, in which hydrogen\n\nreduces\n\n(donates its\n\n\u2013\n\nelectron to) carbon dioxide.\n\nRobert Emerson\n\ndiscovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600\u00a0nm wavelengths, the other up to 700\u00a0nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll \"a\", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll \"a\" with most of the available chlorophyll \"b\", among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII system, which in turn powers the photochemistry.\n\n[13]\n\nRobert Hill\n\nthought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate to cytochrome b\n\n6\n\n(now a plastoquinone), another is from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient reductant. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water, were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated\n\nchloroplasts\n\ngive off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like\n\niron\n\noxalate\n\n,\n\nferricyanide\n\nor\n\nbenzoquinone\n\nafter exposure to light. The Hill reaction\n\n[75]\n\nis as follows:\n\n2 H\n\n2\n\nO + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) \u2192 2 AH\n\n2\n\n+ O\n\n2\n\nwhere A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved.\n\nSamuel Ruben\n\nand\n\nMartin Kamen\n\nused\n\nradioactive isotopes\n\nto determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water.\n\nMelvin Calvin\n\nworks in his photosynthesis laboratory.\n\nMelvin Calvin\n\nand\n\nAndrew Benson\n\n, along with\n\nJames Bassham\n\n, elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the\n\nCalvin cycle\n\n, which ignores the contribution of Bassham and Benson. Many scientists refer to the cycle as the Calvin-Benson Cycle, Benson-Calvin, and some even call it the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle.\n\nNobel Prize\n\n-winning scientist\n\nRudolph A. Marcus\n\nwas able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain.\n\nOtto Heinrich Warburg\n\nand\n\nDean Burk\n\ndiscovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits the CO\n\n2\n\n, activated by the respiration.\n\n[76]\n\nIn 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of\n\nphotophosphorylation\n\nin vivo\n\nwas presented by\n\nOtto Kandler\n\nusing intact\n\nChlorella\n\ncells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent\n\nATP\n\nformation.\n\n[77]\n\nIn 1954,\n\nDaniel I. Arnon\n\net al. discovered photophosphorylation\n\nin vitro\n\nin isolated\n\nchloroplasts\n\nwith the help of P\n\n32\n\n.\n\n[78]\n\n[79]\n\nLouis N.M. Duysens\n\nand\n\nJan Amesz\n\ndiscovered that chlorophyll a will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, chlorophyll a (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series.\n\nDevelopment of the concept\n\nIn 1893,\n\nCharles Reid Barnes\n\nproposed two terms,\n\nphotosyntax\n\nand\n\nphotosynthesis\n\n, for the biological process of\n\nsynthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light\n\n. Over time, the term\n\nphotosynthesis\n\ncame into common usage as the term of choice. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.\n\n[80]\n\nC3\u00a0: C4 photosynthesis research\n\nAfter   WWII at late 1940 at the\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\n, the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists\n\nMelvin Calvin\n\n, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques.\n\n[81]\n\nThe pathway of CO\n\n2\n\nfixation by the algae\n\nChlorella\n\nin a fraction of a second in light resulted in a 3 carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nwas awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 \u03bcmol CO\n\n2\n\n\u00b7m\n\n\u22122\n\n\u00b7s\n\n\u22121\n\n, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants having the same photosynthetic capacities that were light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.\n\n[82]\n\n[83]\n\nLater in 1958\u20131963 at\n\nCornell University\n\n, field grown\n\nmaize\n\nwas reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 \u03bcmol CO\n\n2\n\n\u00b7m\n\n\u22122\n\n\u00b7s\n\n\u22121\n\nand was not saturated at near full sunlight.\n\n[84]\n\n[85]\n\nThis higher rate in maize was almost double those observed in other species such as wheat and  soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of monocot and dicot uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are  crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species.\n\n[86]\n\n[87]\n\nIn tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38\u221240 \u03bcmol CO\n\n2\n\n\u00b7m\n\n\u22122\n\n\u00b7s\n\n\u22121\n\n, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i. e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist\n\nGottlieb Haberlandt\n\nwhile studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane.\n\n[88]\n\nPlant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO\n\n2\n\ncompensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light.\n\n[89]\n\nThe research at Arizona was designated Citation Classic by the ISI 1986.\n\n[87]\n\nThese species was later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO\n\n2\n\nfixation in light has 4 carbon as malate and aspartate.\n\n[90]\n\n[91]\n\n[92]\n\nOther species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the 3-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO\n\n2\n\nin measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 \u03bcmol CO\n\n2\n\n\u00b7m\n\n\u22122\n\n\u00b7s\n\n\u22121\n\nindicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants.\n\n[86]\n\n[87]\n\nFactors\n\nThe\n\nleaf\n\nis the primary site of photosynthesis in plants.\n\nThere are three main factors affecting photosynthesis\n\n[\n\nclarification needed\n\n]\n\nand several corollary factors. The three main are:\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nLight\n\nirradiance\n\nand\n\nwavelength\n\nCarbon dioxide\n\nconcentration\n\nTemperature\n\n.\n\nTotal photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of\n\nleaf\n\narea a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the\n\nchloroplasts\n\nto support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.\n\n[93]\n\nLight intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature\n\nSee also:\n\nPI (photosynthesis-irradiance) curve\n\nAbsorbance\n\nspectra of free chlorophyll\n\na\n\n(\n\nblue\n\n) and\n\nb\n\n(\n\nred\n\n) in a solvent. The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified\n\nin vivo\n\ndepending on specific pigment\u2013protein interactions.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.\n\n[94]\n\nThe radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, with both time and space.\n\nIn the early 20th century,\n\nFrederick Blackman\n\nand\n\nGabrielle Matthaei\n\ninvestigated the effects of light intensity (\n\nirradiance\n\n) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation.\n\nAt constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance.\n\nAt low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.\n\nThese two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general,\n\nphotochemical\n\nreactions are not affected by\n\ntemperature\n\n. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the\n\nlight-dependent 'photochemical'\n\ntemperature-independent stage, and the\n\nlight-independent, temperature-dependent\n\nstage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of\n\nlimiting factors\n\n. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, a series of proteins with different pigments surround the reaction center. This unit is called a\n\nphycobilisome\n\n.\n\n[\n\nclarification needed\n\n]\n\nCarbon dioxide levels and photorespiration\n\nPhotorespiration\n\nAs carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the\n\nlight-independent reactions\n\nincreases until limited by other factors.\n\nRuBisCO\n\n, the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will\n\nfix carbon dioxide\n\n. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called\n\nphotorespiration\n\n, uses energy, but does not produce sugars.\n\nRuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:\n\nOne product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of\n\n3-phosphoglycerate\n\n(3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the\n\nCalvin-Benson cycle\n\n.\n\nPhosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.\n\nSalvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce\n\nammonia\n\n(NH\n\n3\n\n), which is able to\n\ndiffuse\n\nout of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen.\n\nA highly simplified summary is:\n\n2 glycolate + ATP \u2192 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH\n\n3\n\nThe salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as\n\nphotorespiration\n\n, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.\n\nSee also\n\nEnvironment portal\n\nEcology portal\n\nEarth sciences portal\n\nMetabolism portal\n\nJan Anderson (scientist)\n\nArtificial photosynthesis\n\nCalvin-Benson cycle\n\nCarbon fixation\n\nCellular respiration\n\nChemosynthesis\n\nDaily light integral\n\nHill reaction\n\nIntegrated fluorometer\n\nLight-dependent reaction\n\nOrganic reaction\n\nPhotobiology\n\nPhotoinhibition\n\nPhotosynthetic reaction center\n\nPhotosynthetically active radiation\n\nPhotosystem\n\nPhotosystem I\n\nPhotosystem II\n\nQuantum biology\n\nRadiosynthesis\n\nRed edge\n\nVitamin D\n\nReferences\n\n^\n\n\"photosynthesis\"\n\n.\n\nOnline Etymology Dictionary\n\n.\n\nArchived\n\nfrom the original on 2013-03-07\n\n.
