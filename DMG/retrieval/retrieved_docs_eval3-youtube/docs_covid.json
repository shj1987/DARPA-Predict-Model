For decades, corporate media's propaganda machinery has been pedestalizing Bill Gates as a billionaire philanthropist genius who invented Microsoft and wishes to help humanity. But Bill Gates is neither a genius nor interested in the wellbeing of the working class and the poor. He was born into the 1% from a father who rubbed shoulders with central banking elites like the Rockefellers. Bill's grandfather was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Seattle. Bill's mother came from a long line of money and power as the daughter of a wealthy banker and the granddaughter of the president of the national city bank of Seattle and the director of the Seattle branch of the Federal Reserve. Bill Gates simply used his parent's money to pay the company that stole the DOS from its original inventor Gary Kildall. Bill also tried to conspire against his own partner Paul Allen by cunningly reducing his shares at Microsoft. After funding the creation of COVID19, Bill Gates is now appearing constantly on the Rothschild-owned corporate media to reaffirm his position that the martial law will never end unless everyone on Earth is forcefully vaccinated for the virus that he helped create. Yes, the same guy who created the world's first computer virus and who's currently in the business of viruses and vaccines, is promising the whole world a mandatory vaccine. Three years ago at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Bill Gates warned the world of a deadly coronavirus pandemic that could kill over 30 million people. In the same year of that speech, Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates vowed that they would not give up on their goal to implement population control (\"Family Planning\" in doublespeak) on 120 million women worldwide by 2020. Not only Bill Gates has been warning for years about a deadly coronavirus outbreak that would kill millions of people, but he also ran a coronavirus simulation a couple of months before the real outbreak in Wuhan. Scientists funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation simulated a global coronavirus pandemic that was dubbed Event 201, and it showed that a coronavirus outbreak could potentially kill hundreds of millions of people under the right circumstances. Bill Gates is now funding a 10-year-old company called Moderna to develop and patent a vaccine for COVID19. Moderna's stocks have been soaring since the beginning of the pandemic. Bill Gates is a known eugenicist who actively pursues population control through vaccinations and drugs around the globe. His obsession with population control, sterilization, and abortion is inspired by his father, who was the head of Planned Parenthood. He regularly gives televised speeches and openly talks about culling the global human population by 10 or 15% through vaccines. Hundreds of thousands of children in Africa and Asia died or were crippled by vaccine experiments conducted on them through corporations funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Most often these vaccines have been used as a trojan horse by Bill Gates to satisfy his obsession with population control. For example, under the guise of eradicating neonatal tetanus, a campaign funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation carried out a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise in Kenya in 2014 using an antigen that causes miscarriages in a vaccine that was administered to 2.3 million girls and women by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Both the WHO and UNICEF are mercenary companies for Bill Gates.\n\n#BillGates #Plandemic #ID2020 #UNICEF #WHO #MedicalMartialLaw #MedicalMartialLaw2020 #MartialLaw #MartialLaw2020 #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #NWO #NewWorldOrder #COVID19 #COVID19Bioweapon #Coronavirus #COVID19Lockdown #BiologicalWeapons #WuhanCoronavirus #WuhanVirus #Pandemic #PopulationControl #FamilyPlanning #SelfIsolation #NewNorm #BigBrother #ProblemReactionSolution #BillAndMelindaGatesFoundation #GatesFoundation #GaryKildall #Microsoft #DOS\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://is.gd/p759wR\n\nhttps://is.gd/yX4nV5\n\nhttps://is.gd/22XdGn\n\nhttps://is.gd/YsU9iX\n\nhttps://is.gd/NUzpWa\n\nhttps://is.gd/mKvBaj\n\nhttps://is.gd/t9HSAc\n\nhttps://is.gd/5MOKII\n\nhttps://is.gd/3iJdqb\n\nhttps://is.gd/9b1tNU\n\nhttps://is.gd/Wyu55W\n\nhttps://is.gd/YltQ1Z\n\nhttps://is.gd/iSSiLR\n\nhttps://is.gd/wzhn0g\n\nhttps://is.gd/xEDruQ\n\nhttps://is.gd/nizrC7\n\nhttps://is.gd/GVQKgQ\n\nhttps://is.gd/XhlS3b\n\nhttps://is.gd/mCbdXK\n\nhttps://is.gd/wVUYvL\n\nhttps://is.gd/G85jPr\n\nhttps://is.gd/80bRg4\n\nhttps://is.gd/hsrcRq\n\nLESS\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|    Category |                                    News &amp; Politics | \n| Sensitivity | Normal - Content that is suitable for ages 16 and over | \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlaying Next\n\n313\n\n0:23\n\nLady Gaga Speaks At The World Health Organization\n\nBig Brother\n\n11\u00a0months, 2\u00a0weeks ago\n\nRelated Videos\n\n98\n\n1:46\n\nRIP Women's Sports\n\n5\u00a0days, 22\u00a0hours ago\n\n112\n\n1:00\n\nThe World Is So Fucked Up... \ud83d\ude14\n\n1\u00a0week ago\n\n91\n\n0:40\n\nC'mon Man!\n\n1\u00a0week, 3\u00a0days ago\n\n143\n\n2:12\n\nThere's No Hope For The Order-following Sheeple\n\n1\u00a0week, 5\u00a0days ago\n\n282\n\n1:13\n\nMeet The Chief Public Health Officer Of Canada\n\n1\u00a0week, 6\u00a0days ago\n\n149\n\n0:20\n\n\"Those Who Sacrifice Their Liberty For Safety Deserve Neither Liberty Nor Safety.\" \u2015 Benjamin Frankl\n\n2\u00a0weeks ago\n\nWarning - This video exceeds your sensitivity preference!\n\nTo dismiss this warning and continue to watch the video please click on the button below.\n\nNote -\n\nAutoplay has been disabled for this video.\n\nWatch this video\n\nBitChute is a peer-to-peer content sharing platform.

Kirkpatrick\n\nPublished\n\nMay 21, 2020\n\nUpdated\n\nNov. 25, 2020\n\nExpanding its pursuit of an inoculation against the\n\ncoronavirus\n\n, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday it would provide \u201cup to $1.2 billion\u201d to the drug company\n\nAstraZeneca\n\nto develop a potential\n\nvaccine\n\nfrom a laboratory at Oxford University.\n\nThe deal with AstraZeneca is the fourth and by far the largest\n\nvaccine\n\nresearch agreement that the department has disclosed. The money will pay for a Phase 3 clinical trial of a potential vaccine in the United States this summer with about 30,000 volunteers.\n\nThe H.H.S. statement said the agency and AstraZeneca \u201care collaborating to make available at least 300 million doses,\u201d and projected that the first doses could be available as early as October.\n\nThat is a very accelerated, ambitious timetable. Most public health experts and\n\nscientists caution that a viable, mass-produced vaccine would probably not be available until sometime next year, at the earliest\n\n. Plus, billions of doses would be needed around the world.\n\nThere is no proven treatment or vaccine against the virus, and infectious-disease experts also warn that many vaccine candidates take years to perfect. Some fail or cause such severe side effects that human trials are halted.\n\nDifferent Approaches to a Coronavirus Vaccine\n\nScientists are using many techniques to develop coronavirus vaccines.\n\nBut even before any are approved, governments and other organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are spending millions of dollars to prepare for the manufacturing of several potential vaccines to make them broadly available as soon as possible.\n\nIn a separate statement, AstraZeneca said it had reached agreements with several governments and other organizations to produce at least 400 million doses, had \u201csecured manufacturing capacity for one billion doses,\u201d and will begin its first deliveries in September.\n\nAstraZeneca said it was also discussing deals for simultaneous production by other companies, including the giant Serum Institute of India, a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world.\n\nThe Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at H.H.S. is distributing billions of dollars to companies to develop vaccines, including the latest funding to AstraZeneca. The authority, known as Barda, has already agreed to provide up to $483 million to the biotech company Moderna and $500 million to\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nfor their separate vaccine efforts. It has also agreed to provide $30 million to a coronavirus vaccine effort by the French company Sanofi, building on a larger contract announced last December for making flu inoculations.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak\n\n\u203a\n\nLatest Updates\n\nUpdated\n\nApril 1, 2021, 11:02 p.m. ET\n\nThe F.D.A. authorizes fuller vials from Moderna, a boost to vaccine stock.\n\nA decline in testing may be masking the spread of the virus in some U.S. states.\n\nWord that a vaccine works well in adolescents raises hopes for normal schooling in the fall.\n\nScores of vaccine efforts are underway around the world\n\n, and several\n\npotential vaccines\n\nare now in at least small-scale clinical trials. But the\n\nOxford vaccine\n\ncandidate, now licensed by AstraZeneca, has moved quickly into the kind of large-scale testing necessary to prove safety and effectiveness.\n\n[\n\nFollow our Live Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker\n\n.]\n\nBuilding on efforts to develop a vaccine against a similar disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the Oxford scientists last month began a Phase I trial of their potential vaccine against Covid-19 in Britain involving 1,100 participants. A combined Phase II and Phase III trial involving 5,000 participants is set to begin in Britain by the end of this month.\n\nThe researchers have said that if the vaccine is proven effective, they hope to have an approval for emergency use, worldwide, by September. But a steep decline in the rate of new infections in Britain may make it difficult to prove effectiveness. Ethics rules generally preclude\n\ndeliberately infecting test participants\n\n. That means unless enough test participants who are given a placebo become infected with the virus in the community, the researchers cannot show that the potential vaccine does its job.\n\nThe large-scale tests in the United States this summer may provide another opportunity.\n\nOn Monday,\n\nModerna announced partial data of its first-phase trial\n\n, saying its vaccine candidate had proven safe and that it had provoked an immune response in 45 people, including eight who had extensive tests that found they had produced antibodies that could prevent the virus from infecting cells. It is also working on an accelerated timetable with partners at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Swiss company Lonza. Moderna received approval to move to a second phase involving 600 people and said it would also begin a third stage in July with thousands of healthy people.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stanch the pandemic have been troubled by a series of agency fumbles, starting with\n\ndefective C.D.C. tests that stalled detection of the virus\u2019s spread for weeks\n\nand limited diagnoses for patients at hospitals and clinics.\n\nRecently, President Trump reorganized vaccine and treatment efforts after he dismissed last month the\n\nhead of Barda, Rick Bright, who then filed\n\na whistle-blower complaint contending he had been pressured to seek approval for certain treatments for Covid-19. Just last week, Mr. Trump named Moncef Slaoui, a venture capitalist who was a longtime vaccine executive at GlaxoSmithKline and most recently a board member for Moderna, to help oversee \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the federal drive to accelerate ways to combat the virus.\n\nAs lead scientist of the effort,\n\nDr. Slaoui\u2019s myriad financial and drug company ties have come under scrutiny\n\nfrom watchdog groups. He is working as a contract employee and therefore exempt from conflict-of-interest and disclosure rules that pertain to many executive and federal employees. He did sell his stock in Moderna and donated some of his gains to cancer research, he said in an interview this week.\n\nOn Thursday, as Mr. Trump traveled to Michigan, he was asked about the $1 billion grant to AstraZeneca. While saying he was encouraged by recent vaccine developments, he also suggested \u2014 as he had earlier \u2014 that there would be \u201cbig, big announcements\u201d within the next few weeks or so about treatment or therapeutic developments. But he offered no specifics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\nSite Index\n\nSite Information Navigation\n\n\u00a9\n\n2021\n\nThe New York Times Company\n\nNYTCo\n\nContact Us\n\nAccessibility\n\nWork with us\n\nAdvertise\n\nT Brand Studio\n\nYour Ad Choices\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nTerms of Sale\n\nSite Map\n\nCanada\n\nInternational\n\nHelp\n\nSubscriptions\n",

Nearly 7,000 patients are currently hospitalized, with about 20% of those in intensive care units.\n\nRead More\n\nCalifornia has seen a startling increase in coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths over the\n\npast two months\n\n. The state averaged more than 40,000 new coronavirus infections every day for the week prior to Christmas, according to data from Johns Hopkins University,\n\nfilling up hospitals and pushing health care workers to consider ways to ration care\n\n.\n\nShortage of oxygen canisters, too\n\nA patient lies on a stretcher in the hallway of the overloaded emergency room at Providence St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley, California, on December 23, 2020.\n\nTo solve the oxygen supply issue, some hospitals are moving Covid-19 patients down to lower floors within the medical center, which makes it easier to pump the oxygen through pipes without it freezing.\n\nAnother challenge, Ghaly said, is that several supply companies have a shortage of the actual oxygen canisters that patients can take home once discharged from the hospital. Without the canisters, patients who might otherwise be able to go home -- and free up a bed and health care workers' time -- have to stay in the hospital.\n\nLos Angeles County Department of Health Services confirmed that several hospitals have gone on \"internal disaster\" designation because of oxygen issues, closing themselves off to incoming EMS traffic. The hospitals most impacted are in the eastern areas of LA County and the San Fernando Valley, the department said.\n\nOne aspect of the issue was just the sheer amount of oxygen needed to treat severe Covid-19, which primarily affects the lungs.\n\n\"First, high levels of oxygen are necessary to treat patients with COVID-19, and that level may be up to 10 times more than normal usage,\" the deparmtent said in a statement. \"Hospitals in general are running out of oxygen sooner than under their normal conditions, and the oxygen suppliers are changing their processes to respond to the hospitals' needs.\"\n\nOther hospitals are seeing\n\nshortages of space and staff\n\n.\n\nRecord Covid-19 hospitalizations in US could soon force health experts to ration care\n\nAt Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital in Los Angeles, for example, patients are being treated in tents outside the hospital, in a conference room and in the chapel. Gurneys are taken into the gift shop. Rationing care could be next, hospital CEO Dr. Elaine Batchlor said Monday.\n\n\"If we continue to see an increase in the number of Covid patients, we may be forced to do something that, as health professionals, we all really just loathe having to even think about,\" she said.\n\nAt Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California, nurses that usually care for one or two patients are now caring for three or four, infectious disease specialist Dr. Kimberly Shriner told CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"We have a limited number of ventilators, we have a limited number of ICU beds,\" Shriner said, adding that a team including a bioethicist, a community member, a physician, a nurse and an administrative leader will decide how to divide those resources if it comes down to it.\n\nThese issues can combine for some difficult decisions ahead, said CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner.\n\n\"If you don't have respirators, you don't have nurses to care for patients, you don't have ICU beds, we will have to have these terrible discussions with families, which is why people need to stay home, and when they go out, they need to wear a mask,\" Reiner said.\n\nCNN's Eric Levenson contributed to this report.\n\nSearch\n\nUS\n\nCrime + Justice\n\nEnergy + Environment\n\nExtreme Weather\n\nSpace + Science\n\nWorld\n\nAfrica\n\nAmericas\n\nAsia\n\nAustralia\n\nChina\n\nEurope\n\nIndia\n\nMiddle East\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Biden Presidency\n\nFacts First\n\nUS Elections\n\nBusiness\n\nMarkets\n\nTech\n\nMedia\n\nSuccess\n\nPerspectives\n\nVideos\n\nOpinion\n\nPolitical Op-Eds\n\nSocial Commentary\n\nHealth\n\nFood\n\nFitness\n\nWellness\n\nParenting\n\nVital Signs\n\nEntertainment\n\nStars\n\nScreen\n\nBinge\n\nCulture\n\nMedia\n\nTech\n\nInnovate\n\nGadget\n\nForeseeable Future\n\nMission: Ahead\n\nUpstarts\n\nWork Transformed\n\nInnovative Cities\n\nStyle\n\nArts\n\nDesign\n\nFashion\n\nArchitecture\n\nLuxury\n\nBeauty\n\nVideo\n\nTravel\n\nDestinations\n\nFood and Drink\n\nStay\n\nNews\n\nVideos\n\nSports\n\nPro Football\n\nCollege Football\n\nBasketball\n\nBaseball\n\nSoccer\n\nOlympics\n\nVideos\n\nLive TV\n\nDigital Studios\n\nCNN Films\n\nHLN\n\nTV Schedule\n\nTV Shows A-Z\n\nCNNVR\n\nAudio\n\nCoupons\n\nCNN Underscored\n\nExplore\n\nWellness\n\nGadgets\n\nLifestyle\n\nCNN Store\n\nWeather\n\nClimate\n\nStorm Tracker\n\nWildfire Tracker\n\nVideo\n\nMore\n\nPhotos\n\nLongform\n\nInvestigations\n\nCNN Profiles\n\nCNN Leadership\n\nCNN Newsletters\n\nWork for CNN\n\nUS\n\nFollow CNN\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAccessibility & CC\n\nAdChoices\n\nAbout Us\n\nCNN Store\n\nNewsletters\n\nTranscripts\n\nLicense Footage\n\nCNN Newsource\n\nSitemap\n\n\u00a9\n\n2021\n\nCable News Network.\n\nA Warner Media Company.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.\n\nif (WM.UserConsent.inUserConsentState([\"data-store\",\"measure-ads\",\"measure-content\",\"measure-market\",\"product-develop\"], { id: \"usabilla\" })) {CNN.INJECTOR.loadFeature('usabilla');}\n",

Image: Getty\n\nStacked Farm, an Australian automated vertical indoor farm, has received international interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about the continuity of food supplies.\n\nThe farm produces salad greens and has the capacity for tomatoes and strawberries.\n\nCEO Conrad Smith told Business Insider Australia Stack Farm received significant interest from the Middle East.\n\nVisit Business Insider Australia\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nAussie company Stacked Farm, a fully automated vertical indoor farm, has been gaining international interest amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStacked Farm, founded in 2017, produces salad greens and herbs like lettuce and rocket, and has the capacity tp produce tomatoes and strawberries. It\u2019s even looking at testing out a type of blueberry next year.\n\nThe company has been receiving a lot of interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about virus clusters breaking out in the food supply chain. Back in May, a coronavirus cluster broke out at Melbourne\u2019s Cedar Meats abattoir, which was linked to 62 cases,\n\naccording to the ABC\n\n.\n\n\u201cPeople are more concerned than ever about who is handling their food, where it\u2019s coming from and how many stops it made before arriving on supermarket shelves,\u201d Stacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith said in a statement.\n\nThe company is headquartered in Burleigh Heads, Queensland and has plans to open up farms across Australia as well. \u201cA scaled-up farm in Victoria will be our first major commercial farm,\u201d Smith told Business Insider Australia. Its farm is fully automated, with the produce packed and sealed once its harvested by robotic farming.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pass through the usual supply chains either \u2013 greens and herbs can go directly to wholesalers, retails, hotels and restaurants, unlike traditional produce which passes through a number of hands before reaching our shelves,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\nStacked Farm has a partnership with fresh produce supplier Morco Fresh and counts Dnata as one of its clients as well, which provides aircraft services like flight catering.\n\n\u201cWe are not too dissimilar to a normal farm where we go through markets and we go through wholesalers and food service distributors,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAnd while it mainly supplies to the food service industry, Stacked Farm is looking at a move into retail so people can grab its produce from supermarket shelves as well. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the capacity to do that at the moment,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut when we scale up to our Victorian farm, we will certainly have the capacity to do that and we\u2019ll be looking for retail partners to jump on the journey that we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nThe farms are temperature controlled and automated\n\nStacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith. Image: Troy Archer\n\nStacked Farm grows its produce 12 months a year, without relying on different seasons. Its products are grown in a temperature-controlled environment that is fully automated from seeding to harvesting. The company is looking at post-harvest automation as part of its next business phase.\n\nStacked Farm also makes barley-based livestock feed. \u201cIn a drought-vulnerable country like Australia, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there because while we all think about human consumption, animals are a massive part of the food chain that needs to be considered,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe company\u2019s employees are mainly in the science and tech field rather than traditional farm labourers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not like traditional farms where we require pickers, packers and harvesters,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe employ more labour leaning towards engineering, software engineering, mechanical engineering, CAD designers [and] horticultural scientists.\u201d\n\nThe company has been receiving interest from the Middle East\n\nStacked Farm has received international interest in its farm during the coronavirus pandemic, mainly thanks to concerns over food safety, quality and security.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of food chains that have been broken throughout this COVID-19 pandemic, and we\u2019ve had interest from the Middle East to set up farms there,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cWe have been very enthused by the interest from particularly a couple of states in the Middle East that have governments that really support local industry and local farming.\u201d Smith gave the example of Dubai which relies predominantly on imports.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\n\n, the United Arab Emirates imports up to 90% of its food.\n\nSmith explained that in Dubai, \u201ca lot of produce can\u2019t travel by sea\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve immediately recognised that there\u2019s a problem in their food chain and they need to bring tech businesses to their country to support feeding their people.\u201d And, in the case of Stacked Farm, can help feed livestock too.\n\nSmith added that Stacked Farm can support the future of food production, particularly in extremely hot and dry or extremely cold climates. He explained that\n\none in nine people go hungry\n\naround the world.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations\n\n, by 2050 world food demand is expected to rise by 70%.\n\n\u201cHaving urban indoor vertical farms is definitely [an] exciting prospect for the future,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe can literally shave days off out of the logistics process, we can extend the shelf life of products so there\u2019s less wastage and that in turn will benefit the community.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on\n\nFacebook\n\n,\n\nTwitter\n\n,\n\nLinkedIn\n\n, and\n\nInstagram\n\n.\n\nTagged In\n\naustralian stories\n\ncoronavirus\n\nfood chain\n\nqueensland\n\nstacked farm\n\nBusiness Insider Research\n\nI adopted a dog in 2020, and this handheld vacuum cleaner helped me keep fur off every surface in my house\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nBusiness Insider Australia\n\nContact Editor\n\nGot A Story Tip?\n\nReport Issue\n\nBusiness Insider Video\n\nA company in Uganda is turning the waste from bananas into rugs, place mats, and baskets\n\nHow metalworkers in India are keeping the 600-year-old craft of Bidri art alive\n\nPopular on Facebook\n\nDoing these 24 uncomfortable things will pay off forever\n\nYes, Apple just killed iTunes \u2014 here's what that means for your library of music, movies, and TV shows\n\nWe took a 4-hour flight on the new Delta Airbus jet that Boeing tried to keep out of the US.

Note: Other federal laws, as well as state or local laws, may provide employees with additional protections.\n\nTitle I of the ADA applies to private employers with 15 or more employees. It also applies to state and local government employers, employment agencies, and labor unions. All nondiscrimination standards under Title I of the ADA also apply to federal agencies under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. Basic background information about the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is available on EEOC's\n\ndisability page\n\n.\n\nThe EEO laws, including the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, continue to apply during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they do not interfere with or prevent employers from following the\n\nguidelines and suggestions made by the CDC or state/local public health authorities\n\nabout steps employers should take regarding COVID-19.\n\nEmployers should remember that guidance from public health authorities is likely to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Therefore, employers should continue to follow the most current information on maintaining workplace safety.\n\nMany common workplace inquiries about the COVID-19 pandemic are addressed in the CDC publication \u201c\n\nGeneral Business Frequently Asked Questions\n\n.\u201d\n\nThe EEOC has provided guidance (a publication entitled\n\nPandemic Preparedness in the Workplace and the Americans With Disabilities Act\n\n[\n\nPDF version\n\n]) (\"Pandemic Preparedness\"), consistent with these workplace protections and rules, that can help employers implement strategies to navigate the impact of COVID-19 in the workplace. This pandemic publication, which was written during the prior H1N1 outbreak, is still relevant today and identifies established ADA and Rehabilitation Act principles to answer questions frequently asked about the workplace during a pandemic. It has been updated as of March 19, 2020 to address examples and information regarding COVID-19;\n\nthe new 2020 information appears in bold and is marked with an asterisk\n\n.\n\nOn March 27, 2020 the EEOC provided a webinar (\"3/27/20 Webinar\") which was recorded and transcribed and is available at\n\nwww.eeoc.gov/coronavirus\n\n. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 to be an international pandemic. The EEOC pandemic publication includes a\n\nseparate section\n\nthat answers common employer questions about what to do after a pandemic has been declared. Applying these principles to the COVID-19 pandemic, the following may be useful:\n\nA. Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Exams\n\nThe ADA has restrictions on when and how much medical information an employer may obtain from any applicant or employee. Prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category. Once an employee begins work, any disability-related inquiries or medical exams must be job related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nA.1.\n\nHow much information may an employer request from an employee who calls in sick, in order to protect the rest of its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nDuring a pandemic, ADA-covered employers may ask such employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus. For COVID-19, these include symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.\n\nA.2. When screening employees entering the workplace during this time, may an employer only ask employees about the COVID-19 symptoms EEOC has identified as\n\nexamples\n\n, or may it ask about any symptoms identified by public health authorities as associated with COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAs public health authorities and doctors learn more about COVID-19, they may expand the list of associated symptoms. Employers should rely on the CDC, other public health authorities, and reputable medical sources for guidance on emerging symptoms associated with the disease. These sources may guide employers when choosing questions to ask employees to determine whether they would pose a direct threat to health in the workplace. For example, additional symptoms beyond fever or cough may include new loss of smell or taste as well as gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.\n\nA.3.\n\nWhen may an ADA-covered employer take the body temperature of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nGenerally, measuring an employee's body temperature is a medical examination. Because the CDC and state/local health authorities have acknowledged community spread of COVID-19 and issued attendant precautions, employers may measure employees' body temperature. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\n\nA.4.\n\nDoes the ADA allow employers to require employees to stay home if they have symptoms of the COVID-19?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nYes. The CDC states that employees who become ill with symptoms of COVID-19 should leave the workplace. The ADA does not interfere with employers following this advice.\n\nA.5.\n\nWhen employees return to work, does the ADA allow employers to require a doctor's note certifying fitness for duty?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nYes. Such inquiries are permitted under the ADA either because they would not be disability-related or, if the pandemic were truly severe, they would be justified under the ADA standards for disability-related inquiries of employees. As a practical matter, however, doctors and other health care professionals may be too busy during and immediately after a pandemic outbreak to provide fitness-for-duty documentation. Therefore, new approaches may be necessary, such as reliance on local clinics to provide a form, a stamp, or an e-mail to certify that an individual does not have the pandemic virus.\n\nA.6. May an employer administer a COVID-19 test (a test to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus)\n\nwhen evaluating an employee\u2019s initial or continued presence in the workplace?\n\n(4/23/20; updated 9/8/20 to address stakeholder questions about updates to CDC guidance)\n\nThe ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be \u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d Applying this standard to the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers may take screening steps to determine if\n\nemployees entering the workplace have COVID-19\n\nbecause\n\nan individual with the virus will pose a direct threat\n\nto the health of others. Therefore an employer may choose to administer COVID-19 testing to employees before initially permitting them to enter the workplace and/or periodically to determine if their presence in the workplace poses a direct threat to others. The ADA does not interfere with employers following\n\nrecommendations by the CDC\n\nor other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate. Testing administered by employers consistent with current CDC guidance will meet the ADA\u2019s \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d standard.\n\nConsistent with the ADA standard, employers should ensure that the tests are considered accurate and reliable. For example, employers may review\n\ninformation\n\nfrom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about what may or may not be considered safe and accurate testing, as well as guidance from CDC or other public health authorities. Because the CDC and FDA may revise their recommendations based on new information, it may be helpful to check these agency websites for updates. Employers may wish to consider the incidence of false-positives or false-negatives associated with a particular test. Note that a positive test result reveals that an individual most likely has a current infection and may be able to transmit the virus to others. A negative test result means that the individual did not have detectable COVID-19 at the time of testing.\n\nA negative test does not mean the employee will not acquire the virus later. Based on guidance from medical and public health authorities, employers should still require\u2013to the greatest extent possible\u2013that employees observe infection control practices (such as social distancing, regular handwashing, and other measures) in the workplace to prevent transmission of COVID-19.\n\nNote: Question A.6 and A.8 address screening of employees generally. See Question A.9 regarding decisions to screen individual employees.\n\nA.7. CDC said in its\n\nInterim Guidelines\n\nthat antibody test results \u201cshould not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace.\u201d In light of this CDC guidance, under the ADA may an employer require antibody testing before permitting employees to re-enter the workplace?\n\n(6/17/20)\n\nNo. An antibody test constitutes a medical examination under the ADA. In light of CDC\u2019s\n\nInterim Guidelines\n\nthat antibody test results \u201cshould not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace,\u201d an antibody test at this time does not meet the ADA\u2019s \u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity\u201d standard for medical examinations or inquiries for current employees. Therefore, requiring antibody testing before allowing employees to re-enter the workplace is not allowed under the ADA. Please note that an antibody test is different from a test to determine if someone has an active case of COVID-19 (i.e., a viral test). The EEOC has already stated that COVID-19 viral tests are\n\npermissible under the ADA\n\n.\n\nThe EEOC will continue to closely monitor CDC\u2019s recommendations, and could update this discussion in response to changes in CDC\u2019s recommendations.\n\nA.8. May employers ask all employees physically entering the workplace if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 1)\n\nYes. Employers may ask all employees who will be physically entering the workplace if they have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19, and ask if they have been tested for COVID-19. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 include, for example, fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. The CDC has identified a\n\ncurrent list of symptoms\n\n.\n\nAn employer may exclude those with COVID-19, or symptoms associated with COVID-19, from the workplace because, as EEOC has stated, their presence would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. However, for those employees who are teleworking and are not physically interacting with coworkers or others (for example, customers), the employer would generally not be permitted to ask these questions.\n\nA.9. May a manager ask only one employee\u2014as opposed to asking all employees\u2014questions designed to determine if she has COVID-19, or require that this employee alone have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 3)\n\nIf an employer wishes to ask only a particular employee to answer such questions, or to have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing, the ADA requires the employer to have a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that this person might have the disease. So, it is important for the employer to consider why it wishes to take these actions regarding this particular employee, such as a display of COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, the ADA does not interfere with employers following\n\nrecommendations by the CDC\n\nor other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate.\n\nA.10. May an employer ask an employee who is physically coming into the workplace whether they have family members who have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 4)\n\nNo. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers from asking employees medical questions about family members. GINA, however, does not prohibit an employer from asking employees whether they have had contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 or who may have symptoms associated with the disease. Moreover, from a public health perspective, only asking an employee about his contact with family members would unnecessarily limit the information obtained about an employee\u2019s potential exposure to COVID-19.\n\nA.11. What may an employer do under the ADA if an employee refuses to permit the employer to take his temperature or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 2)\n\nUnder the circumstances existing currently, the ADA allows an employer to bar an employee from physical presence in the workplace if he refuses to have his temperature taken or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19. To gain the cooperation of employees, however, employers may wish to ask the reasons for the employee\u2019s refusal. The employer may be able to provide information or reassurance that they are taking these steps to ensure the safety of everyone in the workplace, and that these steps are consistent with health screening recommendations from CDC. Sometimes, employees are reluctant to provide medical information because they fear an employer may widely spread such personal medical information throughout the workplace. The ADA prohibits such broad disclosures. Alternatively, if an employee requests reasonable accommodation with respect to screening, the usual accommodation process should be followed; this is discussed in Question G.7.\n\nA.12. During the COVID-19 pandemic, may an employer request information from employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, who report feeling ill or who call in sick?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 6)\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time employers may ask employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, and report feeling ill or who call in sick, questions about their symptoms as part of workplace screening for COVID-19.\n\nA.13. May an employer ask an employee why he or she has been absent from work?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 15)\n\nYes. Asking why an individual did not report to work is not a disability-related inquiry. An employer is always entitled to know why an employee has not reported for work.\n\nA.14. When an employee returns from travel during a pandemic, must an employer wait until the employee develops COVID-19 symptoms to ask questions about where the person has traveled?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 8)\n\nNo. Questions about where a person traveled would not be disability-related inquiries. If the CDC or state or local public health officials recommend that people who visit specified locations remain at home for a certain period of time, an employer may ask whether employees are returning from these locations, even if the travel was personal.\n\nB. Confidentiality of Medical Information\n\nWith limited exceptions, the ADA requires employers to keep confidential any medical information they learn about any applicant or employee.\n\nMedical information includes not only a diagnosis or treatments, but also the fact that an individual has requested or is receiving a reasonable accommodation.\n\nB.1. May an employer store in existing medical files information it obtains related to COVID-19, including the results of taking an employee's temperature or the employee's self-identification as having this disease, or must the employer create a new medical file system solely for this information?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nThe ADA requires that all medical information about a particular employee be stored separately from the employee's personnel file, thus limiting access to this\n\nconfidential information\n\n. An employer may store all medical information related to COVID-19 in existing medical files. This includes an employee's statement that he has the disease or suspects he has the disease, or the employer's notes or other documentation from questioning an employee about symptoms.\n\nB.2. If an employer requires all employees to have a daily temperature check before entering the workplace, may the employer maintain a log of the results?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes. The employer needs to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\n\nB.3. May an employer disclose the name of an employee to a public health agency when it learns that the employee has COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes\n\n.\n\nB.4. May a temporary staffing agency or a contractor that places an employee in an employer's workplace notify the employer if it learns the employee has COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes. The staffing agency or contractor may notify the employer and disclose the name of the employee, because the employer may need to determine if this employee had contact with anyone in the workplace.\n\nB.5. Suppose a manager learns that an employee has COVID-19, or has symptoms associated with the disease. The manager knows she must report it but is worried about violating ADA confidentiality. What should she do?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 5)\n\nThe ADA requires that an employer keep all medical information about employees confidential, even if that information is not about a disability. Clearly, the information that an employee has symptoms of, or a diagnosis of, COVID-19, is medical information. But the fact that this is medical information does not prevent the manager from reporting to appropriate employer officials so that they can take actions consistent with guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities.\n\nThe question is really what information to report: is it the fact that an employee\u2014unnamed\u2014has symptoms of COVID-19 or a diagnosis, or is it the identity of that employee? Who in the organization needs to know the identity of the employee will depend on each workplace and why a specific official needs this information. Employers should make every effort to limit the number of people who get to know the name of the employee.\n\nThe ADA does not interfere with a designated representative of the employer interviewing the employee to get a list of people with whom the employee possibly had contact through the workplace, so that the employer can then take action to notify those who may have come into contact with the employee, without revealing the employee\u2019s identity. For example, using a generic descriptor, such as telling employees that \u201csomeone at this location\u201d or \u201csomeone on the fourth floor\u201d has COVID-19, provides notice and does not violate the ADA\u2019s prohibition of disclosure of confidential medical information.\n\nFor small employers, coworkers might be able to figure out who the employee is, but employers in that situation are still prohibited from confirming or revealing the employee\u2019s identity. Also, all employer officials who are designated as needing to know the identity of an employee should be specifically instructed that they must maintain the confidentiality of this information. Employers may want to plan in advance what supervisors and managers should do if this situation arises and determine who will be responsible for receiving information and taking next steps.\n\nB.6. An employee who must report to the workplace knows that a coworker who reports to the same workplace has symptoms associated with COVID-19. Does ADA confidentiality prevent the first employee from disclosing the coworker's symptoms to a supervisor?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 6)\n\nNo. ADA confidentiality does not prevent this employee from communicating to his supervisor about a coworker\u2019s symptoms. In other words, it is not an ADA confidentiality violation for this employee to inform his supervisor about a coworker\u2019s symptoms. After learning about this situation, the supervisor should contact appropriate management officials to report this information and discuss next steps.\n\nB.7. An employer knows that an employee is teleworking because the person has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, and that he is in self-quarantine. May the employer tell staff that this particular employee is teleworking without saying why?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 7)\n\nYes. If staff need to know how to contact the employee, and that the employee is working even if not present in the workplace, then disclosure that the employee is teleworking without saying why is permissible. Also, if the employee was on leave rather than teleworking because he has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, or any other medical condition, then an employer cannot disclose the reason for the leave, just the fact that the individual is on leave.\n\nB.8. Many employees, including managers and supervisors, are now teleworking as a result of COVID-19. How are they supposed to keep medical information of employees confidential while working remotely?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 9)\n\nThe ADA requirement that medical information be kept confidential includes a requirement that it be stored separately from regular personnel files. If a manager or supervisor receives medical information involving COVID-19, or any other medical information, while teleworking, and is able to follow an employer\u2019s existing confidentiality protocols while working remotely, the supervisor has to do so. But to the extent that is not feasible, the supervisor still must safeguard this information to the greatest extent possible until the supervisor can properly store it. This means that paper notepads, laptops, or other devices should not be left where others can access the protected information.\n\nSimilarly, documentation must not be stored electronically where others would have access. A manager may even wish to use initials or another code to further ensure confidentiality of the name of an employee.\n\nC. Hiring and Onboarding\n\nUnder the ADA, prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category.\n\nC.1.\n\nIf an employer is hiring, may it screen applicants for symptoms of COVID-19?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. An employer may screen job applicants for symptoms of COVID-19 after making a conditional job offer, as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same type of job. This ADA rule applies whether or not the applicant has a disability.\n\nC.2.\n\nMay an employer take an applicant's temperature as part of a post-offer, pre-employment medical exam?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. Any medical exams are permitted after an employer has made a conditional offer of employment. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\n\nC.3.\n\nMay an employer delay the start date of an applicant\n\nwho has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. According to current CDC guidance, an individual who has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it should not be in the workplace.\n\nC.4.\n\nMay an employer withdraw a job offer whe\n\nn it needs the applicant to start immediately but the individual has COVID-19 or symptoms of it?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nBased on current CDC guidance, this individual cannot safely enter the workplace, and therefore the employer may withdraw the job offer.\n\nC.5. May an employer postpone the start date or withdraw a job offer because the individual is 65 years old or pregnant, both of which place them at higher risk from COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nNo. The fact that the CDC has identified those who are 65 or older, or pregnant women, as being at greater risk does not justify unilaterally postponing the start date or withdrawing a job offer. However, an employer may choose to allow telework or to discuss with these individuals if they would like to postpone the start date.\n\nD. Reasonable Accommodation\n\nUnder the ADA, reasonable accommodations are adjustments or modifications provided by an employer to enable people with disabilities to enjoy equal employment opportunities. If a reasonable accommodation is needed and requested by an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform a job, or enjoy benefits and privileges of employment, the employer must provide it unless it would pose an undue hardship, meaning significant difficulty or expense. An employer has the discretion to choose among effective accommodations. Where a requested accommodation would result in undue hardship, the employer must offer an alternative accommodation if one is available absent undue hardship. In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website for types of accommodations,\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n. JAN's materials specific to COVID-19 are at\n\nhttps://askjan.org/topics/COVID-19.cfm\n\n.\n\nD.1. If a job may only be performed at the workplace, are there\n\nreasonable accommodations\n\nfor individuals with disabilities, absent\n\nundue hardship\n\n,\n\nthat could offer protection to an employee who, due to a preexisting disability, is at higher risk from COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nThere may be reasonable accommodations that\n\ncould offer protection to an individual whose disability puts him at greater risk from COVID-19\n\nand who therefore requests such actions to eliminate possible exposure. Even with the constraints imposed by a pandemic, some accommodations may meet an employee's needs on a temporary basis without causing undue hardship on the employer.\n\nLow-cost solutions achieved with materials already on hand or easily obtained may be effective. If not already implemented for all employees, accommodations for those who request reduced contact with others due to a disability may include changes to the work environment such as designating one-way aisles; using plexiglass, tables, or other barriers to ensure minimum distances between customers and coworkers whenever feasible per\n\nCDC guidance\n\nor other accommodations that reduce chances of exposure.\n\nFlexibility by employers and employees is important in determining if some accommodation is possible in the circumstances. Temporary job restructuring of marginal job duties, temporary transfers to a different position, or modifying a work schedule or shift assignment may also permit an individual with a disability to perform safely the essential functions of the job while reducing exposure to others in the workplace or while commuting.\n\nD.2. If an employee has a preexisting mental illness or disorder that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, may he now be entitled to a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship)?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAlthough many people feel significant stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees with certain preexisting mental health conditions, for example, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, may have more difficulty handling the disruption to daily life that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs with any accommodation request, employers may: ask questions to determine whether the condition is a disability; discuss with the employee how the requested accommodation would assist him and enable him to keep working; explore alternative accommodations that may effectively meet his needs; and request medical documentation if needed.\n\nD.3. In a workplace where all employees are required to telework during this time, should an employer postpone discussing a request from an employee with a disability for an accommodation that will not be needed until he returns to the workplace when mandatory telework ends?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nNot necessarily. An employer may give higher priority to discussing requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed while teleworking, but the employer may begin discussing this request now. The employer may be able to acquire all the information it needs to make a decision. If a reasonable accommodation is granted, the employer also may be able to make some arrangements for the accommodation in advance.\n\nD.4. What if an employee was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and now requests an additional or altered accommodation?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAn employee who was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be entitled to an additional or altered accommodation, absent undue hardship. For example, an employee who is teleworking because of the pandemic may need a different type of accommodation than what he\n\nuses in the workplace\n\n. The employer\n\nmay discuss\n\nwith the employee whether the same or a different disability is the basis for this new request and why an additional or altered accommodation is needed.\n\nD.5. During the pandemic, if an employee requests an accommodation for a medical condition either at home or in the workplace, may an employer still request information to determine if the condition is a disability?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee has a \"disability\" as defined by the ADA (a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, or a history of a substantially limiting impairment).\n\nD.6. During the pandemic, may an employer still engage in the interactive process and request information from an employee about why an accommodation is needed?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request\n\nmedical documentation\n\nto determine whether the employee's disability necessitates an accommodation, either the one he requested or any other.\n\nPossible questions\n\nfor the employee may include: (1) how the disability creates a limitation, (2) how the requested accommodation will effectively address the limitation, (3) whether another form of accommodation could effectively address the issue, and (4) how a proposed accommodation will enable the employee to continue performing the \"essential functions\" of his position (that is, the fundamental job duties).\n\nD.7. If there is some urgency to providing an accommodation, or the employer has limited time available to discuss the request during the pandemic, may an employer provide a temporary accommodation?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. Given the pandemic, some employers may choose to forgo or shorten the exchange of information between an employer and employee known as the \"interactive process\" (discussed in D.5 and D.6., above) and grant the request. In addition, when government restrictions change, or are partially or fully lifted, the need for accommodations may also change. This may result in more requests for short-term accommodations. Employers may wish to adapt the interactive process\u2014and devise end dates for the accommodation\u2014to suit changing circumstances based on public health directives.\n\nWhatever the reason for shortening or adapting the interactive process, an employer may also choose to place an end date on the accommodation (for example, either a specific date such as May 30, or when the employee returns to the workplace part- or full-time due to changes in government restrictions limiting the number of people who may congregate). Employers may also opt to provide a requested accommodation on an interim or trial basis, with an end date, while awaiting receipt of medical documentation. Choosing one of these alternatives may be particularly helpful where the requested accommodation would provide protection that an employee may need because of a pre-existing disability that puts her at greater risk during this pandemic. This\n\ncould also apply\n\nto employees who have disabilities exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nEmployees may request an extension that an employer must consider, particularly if current government restrictions are extended or new ones adopted.\n\nD.8. May an employer invite employees now to ask for reasonable accommodations they may need in the future when they are permitted to return to the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20; updated 9/8/20 to address stakeholder questions)\n\nYes. Employers may inform the workforce that employees with disabilities may request accommodations in advance that they believe they may need when the workplace re-opens. This is discussed in greater detail in Question G.6. If advance requests are received, employers may begin the \"interactive process\" \u2013 the discussion between the employer and employee focused on whether the impairment is a disability and the reasons that an accommodation is needed. If an employee chooses not to request accommodation in advance, and instead requests it at a later time, the employer must still consider the request at that time.\n\nD.9. Are the circumstances of the pandemic relevant to whether a requested accommodation can be denied because it poses an undue hardship?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. An employer does not have to provide a particular reasonable accommodation if it poses an \"\n\nundue hardship\n\n,\" which means \"significant difficulty or expense.\" As described in the two questions that follow, in some instances, an accommodation that would not have posed an undue hardship prior to the pandemic may pose one now.\n\nD.10. What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \"significant difficulty\" during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nAn employer may consider whether current circumstances create \"significant difficulty\" in acquiring or providing certain accommodations, considering the facts of the particular job and workplace. For example, it may be significantly more difficult in this pandemic to conduct a needs assessment or to acquire certain items, and delivery may be impacted, particularly for employees who may be teleworking. Or, it may be significantly more difficult to provide employees with temporary assignments, to remove marginal functions, or to readily hire temporary workers for specialized positions. If a particular accommodation poses an undue hardship, employers and employees should work together to determine if there may be an alternative that could be provided that does not pose such problems.\n\nD.11. What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \"significant expense\" during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most accommodations did not pose a significant expense when considered against an employer's overall budget and resources (always considering the budget/resources of the entire entity and not just its components). But, the sudden loss of some or all of an employer's income stream because of this pandemic is a relevant consideration. Also relevant is the amount of discretionary funds available at this time\u2014when considering other expenses\u2014and whether there is an expected date that current restrictions on an employer's operations will be lifted (or new restrictions will be added or substituted). These considerations do not mean that an employer can reject any accommodation that costs money; an employer must weigh the cost of an accommodation against its current budget while taking into account constraints created by this pandemic. For example, even under current circumstances, there may be many no-cost or very low-cost accommodations.\n\nD.12. Do the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to applicants or employees who are classified as \u201c\n\ncritical infrastructure workers\n\n\u201d or \u201c\n\nessential critical workers\n\n\u201d by the CDC?\n\n(4/23/20)\n\nYes. These CDC designations, or any other designations of certain employees, do not eliminate coverage under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, or any other equal employment opportunity law. Therefore, employers receiving requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act from employees falling in these categories of jobs must accept and process the requests as they would for any other employee. Whether the request is granted will depend on whether the worker is an individual with a disability, and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be provided absent undue hardship.\n\nD.13. Is an employee entitled to an accommodation under the ADA in order to avoid exposing a family member who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nNo. Although the ADA prohibits discrimination based on association with an individual with a disability, that protection is limited to disparate treatment or harassment. The ADA does not require that an employer accommodate an employee without a disability based on the disability-related needs of a family member or other person with whom she is associated.\n\nFor example, an employee without a disability is not entitled under the ADA to telework as an accommodation in order to protect a family member with a disability from potential COVID-19 exposure.\n\nOf course, an employer is free to provide such flexibilities if it chooses to do so. An employer choosing to offer additional flexibilities beyond what the law requires should be careful not to engage in disparate treatment on a protected EEO basis.\n\nD.14. When an employer requires some or all of its employees to telework because of COVID-19 or government officials require employers to shut down their facilities and have workers telework, is the employer required to provide a teleworking employee with the same reasonable accommodations for disability under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that it provides to this individual in the workplace?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 20\n\n)\n\nIf such a request is made, the employer and employee should discuss what the employee needs and why, and whether the same or a different accommodation could suffice in the home setting. For example, an employee may already have certain things in their home to enable them to do their job so that they do not need to have all of the accommodations that are provided in the workplace.\n\nAlso, the undue hardship considerations might be different when evaluating a request for accommodation when teleworking rather than working in the workplace. A reasonable accommodation that is feasible and does not pose an undue hardship in the workplace might pose one when considering circumstances, such as the place where it is needed and the reason for telework. For example, the fact that the period of telework may be of a temporary or unknown duration may render certain accommodations either not feasible or an undue hardship. There may also be constraints on the normal availability of items or on the ability of an employer to conduct a necessary assessment.\n\nAs a practical matter, and in light of the circumstances that led to the need for telework, employers and employees should both be creative and flexible about what can be done when an employee needs a reasonable accommodation for telework at home. If possible, providing interim accommodations might be appropriate while an employer discusses a request with the employee or is waiting for additional information.\n\nD.15. Assume that an employer grants telework to employees for the purpose of slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19. When an employer reopens the workplace and recalls employees to the worksite, does the employer automatically have to grant telework as a reasonable accommodation to every employee with a disability who requests to continue this arrangement as an ADA/Rehabilitation Act accommodation?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 21)\n\nNo. Any time an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer is entitled to understand the disability-related limitation that necessitates an accommodation. If there is no disability-related limitation that requires teleworking, then the employer does not have to provide telework as an accommodation. Or, if there is a disability-related limitation but the employer can effectively address the need with another form of reasonable accommodation at the workplace, then the employer can choose that alternative to telework.\n\nTo the extent that an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID-19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions, then a request\u2014after the workplace reopens\u2014to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function. The ADA never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability.\n\nThe fact that an employer temporarily excused performance of one or more essential functions when it closed the workplace and enabled employees to telework for the purpose of protecting their safety from COVID-19, or otherwise chose to permit telework, does not mean that the employer permanently changed a job\u2019s essential functions, that telework is always a feasible accommodation, or that it does not pose an undue hardship. These are fact-specific determinations. The employer has no obligation under the ADA to refrain from restoring all of an employee\u2019s essential duties at such time as it chooses to restore the prior work arrangement, and then evaluating any requests for continued or new accommodations under the usual ADA rules.\n\nD.16. Assume that prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employee with a disability had requested telework as a reasonable accommodation. The employee had shown a disability-related need for this accommodation, but the employer denied it because of concerns that the employee would not be able to perform the essential functions remotely. In the past, the employee therefore continued to come to the workplace. However, after the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and temporary telework ends, the employee renews her request for telework as a reasonable accommodation. Can the employer again refuse the request?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 22)\n\nAssuming all the requirements for such a reasonable accommodation are satisfied, the temporary telework experience could be relevant to considering the renewed request. In this situation, for example, the period of providing telework because of the COVID-19 pandemic could serve as a trial period that showed whether or not this employee with a disability could satisfactorily perform all essential functions while working remotely, and the employer should consider any new requests in light of this information. As with all accommodation requests, the employee and the employer should engage in a flexible, cooperative interactive process going forward if this issue does arise.\n\nD.17. Might the pandemic result in excusable delays during the interactive process?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 19)\n\nYes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has disrupted normal work routines and may have resulted in unexpected or increased requests for reasonable accommodation. Although employers and employees should address these requests as soon as possible, the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delay in discussing requests and in providing accommodation where warranted. Employers and employees are encouraged to use interim solutions to enable employees to keep working as much as possible.\n\nD.18. Federal agencies are required to have timelines in their written reasonable accommodation procedures governing how quickly they will process requests and provide reasonable accommodations. What happens if circumstances created by the pandemic prevent an agency from meeting this timeline?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 19)\n\nSituations created by the current COVID-19 crisis may constitute an \u201cextenuating circumstance\u201d\u2014something beyond a Federal agency\u2019s control\u2014that may justify exceeding the normal timeline that an agency has adopted in its internal reasonable accommodation procedures.\n\nE. Pandemic-Related Harassment Due to National Origin, Race, or Other Protected Characteristics\n\nE.1. What practical tools are available to employers to reduce and address workplace harassment that may arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nEmployers can help reduce the chance of harassment by explicitly communicating to the workforce that fear of the COVID-19 pandemic should not be misdirected against individuals because of a protected characteristic, including their\n\nnational origin, race\n\n, or other prohibited bases.\n\nPractical anti-harassment tools provided by the EEOC for small businesses can be found here:\n\nAnti-harassment\n\npolicy tips\n\nfor small businesses\n\nSelect Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace (includes detailed recommendations and tools to aid in designing effective anti-harassment policies; developing training curricula; implementing complaint, reporting, and investigation procedures; creating an organizational culture in which harassment is not tolerated):\n\nreport\n\n;\n\nchecklists\n\nfor employers who want to reduce and address harassment in the workplace; and\n\nchart\n\nof risk factors that lead to harassment and appropriate responses.\n\nE.2. Are there steps an employer should take to address possible harassment and discrimination against coworkers when it re-opens the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. An employer may remind all employees that it is against the federal EEO laws to harass or otherwise discriminate against coworkers based on race, national origin, color, sex, religion, age (40 or over), disability, or genetic information. It may be particularly helpful for employers to advise supervisors and managers of their roles in watching for, stopping, and reporting any harassment or other discrimination. An employer may also make clear that it will immediately review any allegations of harassment or discrimination and take appropriate action.\n\nE.3. How may employers respond to pandemic-related harassment, in particular against employees who are or are perceived to be Asian?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nManagers should be alert to demeaning, derogatory, or hostile remarks directed to employees who are or are perceived to be of Chinese or other Asian national origin, including about the coronavirus or its origins.\n\nAll employers covered by Title VII should ensure that management understands in advance how to recognize such harassment. Harassment may occur using electronic communication tools\u2014regardless of whether employees are in the workplace, teleworking, or on leave\u2014and also in person between employees at the worksite. Harassment of employees at the worksite may also originate with contractors, customers or clients, or, for example, with patients or their family members at health care facilities, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Managers should know their legal obligations and be\n\ninstructed\n\nto quickly identify and resolve potential problems, before they rise to the level of unlawful discrimination.\n\nEmployers may choose to send a reminder to the entire workforce noting Title VII\u2019s prohibitions on harassment, reminding employees that harassment will not be tolerated, and inviting anyone who experiences or witnesses workplace harassment to report it to management. Employers may remind employees that harassment can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nE.4. An employer learns that an employee who is teleworking due to the pandemic is sending harassing emails to another worker. What actions should the employer take?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThe employer should take the same actions it would take if the employee was in the workplace. Employees may not harass other employees through, for example, emails, calls, or platforms for video or chat communication and collaboration.\n\nF. Furloughs and Layoffs\n\nF.1. Under the EEOC's laws, what waiver responsibilities apply when an employer is conducting layoffs?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nSpecial rules apply when an employer is offering employees severance packages in exchange for a general release of all discrimination claims against the employer. More information is available in EEOC's\n\ntechnical assistance document on severance agreements\n\n.\n\nF.2. What are additional EEO considerations in planning furloughs or layoffs?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 13)\n\nThe laws enforced by the EEOC prohibit covered employers from selecting people for furlough or layoff because of that individual\u2019s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, protected genetic information, or in retaliation for protected EEO activity.\n\nG. Return to Work\n\nG.1. As government stay-at-home orders and other restrictions are modified or lifted in your area, how will employers know what steps they can take consistent with the ADA to screen employees for COVID-19 when entering the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nThe ADA permits employers to make disability-related inquiries and conduct medical exams if job-related and consistent with business necessity. Inquiries and reliable medical exams meet this standard if it is necessary to exclude employees with a medical condition that would pose a direct threat to health or safety.\n\nDirect threat is to be determined based on the best available objective medical evidence. The guidance from CDC or other public health authorities is such evidence. Therefore, employers will be acting consistent with the ADA as long as any screening implemented is consistent with advice from the CDC and public health authorities for that type of workplace at that time.\n\nFor example, this may include continuing to take temperatures and asking questions about symptoms (or require self-reporting)\n\nof all those entering the workplace\n\n. Similarly, the CDC recently posted\n\ninformation\n\non return by certain types of critical workers.\n\nEmployers should make sure not to engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in decisions related to screening and exclusion.\n\nG.2. An employer requires returning workers to wear personal protective gear and engage in infection control practices. Some employees ask for accommodations due to a need for modified protective gear. Must an employer grant these requests?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nAn employer may require employees to wear\n\nprotective gear\n\n(for example, masks and gloves) and observe\n\ninfection control practices\n\n(for example, regular hand washing and social distancing protocols).\n\nHowever, where an employee with a disability needs a related reasonable accommodation under the ADA (e.g., non-latex gloves, modified face masks for interpreters or others who communicate with an employee who uses lip reading, or gowns designed for individuals who use wheelchairs), or a religious accommodation under Title VII (such as modified equipment due to religious garb), the employer should discuss the request and provide the modification or an alternative if feasible and not an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business under the ADA or Title VII.\n\nG.3. What does an employee need to do in order to request reasonable accommodation from her employer because she has one of the\n\nmedical conditions\n\nthat CDC says may put her at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\n\n(5/5/20)\n\nAn employee\u2014or a third party, such as an employee\u2019s doctor\u2014must\n\nlet the employer know\n\nthat she needs a change for a reason related to a medical condition (here, the underlying condition). Individuals may request accommodation in conversation or in writing. While the employee (or third party) does not need to use the term \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d or reference the ADA, she may do so.\n\nThe employee or her representative should communicate that she has a medical condition that necessitates a change to meet a medical need. After receiving a request, the employer may\n\nask questions or seek medical documentation\n\nto help decide if the individual has a disability and if there is a reasonable accommodation, barring\n\nundue hardship\n\n, that can be provided.\n\nG.4. The CDC identifies a number of medical conditions that might place individuals at\n\n\u201chigher risk for severe illness\u201d\n\nif they get COVID-19. An employer knows that an employee has one of these conditions and is concerned that his health will be jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, but the employee has not requested accommodation. How does the ADA apply to this situation?\n\n(5/7/20)\n\nFirst, if the employee does not request a reasonable accommodation, the ADA does not mandate that the employer take action.\n\nIf the employer is concerned about the employee\u2019s health being jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, the ADA does not allow the employer to exclude the employee\u2014or take any other adverse action\u2014\n\nsolely\n\nbecause the employee has a disability that the CDC identifies as potentially placing him at \u201chigher risk for severe illness\u201d if he gets COVID-19. Under the ADA, such action is not allowed unless the employee\u2019s disability poses a \u201cdirect threat\u201d to his health that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\n\nThe ADA direct threat requirement is a high standard. As an affirmative defense, direct threat requires an employer to show that the individual has a disability that poses a \u201csignificant risk of substantial harm\u201d to his own health under\n\n29 C.F.R. section 1630.2(r)\n\n(regulation addressing direct threat to health or safety of self or others). A direct threat assessment cannot be based solely on the condition being on the CDC\u2019s list; the determination must be an individualized assessment based on a reasonable medical judgment about this employee\u2019s disability\u2014not the disability in general\u2014using the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. The ADA regulation requires an employer to consider the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. Analysis of these factors will likely include considerations based on the severity of the pandemic in a particular area and the employee\u2019s own health (for example, is the employee\u2019s disability well-controlled), and his particular job duties. A determination of direct threat also would include the likelihood that an individual will be exposed to the virus at the worksite. Measures that an employer may be taking in general to protect all workers, such as mandatory social distancing, also would be relevant.\n\nEven if an employer determines that an employee\u2019s disability poses a direct threat to his own health, the employer still cannot exclude the employee from the workplace\u2014or take any other adverse action\u2014unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship). The ADA regulations require an employer to consider whether there are reasonable accommodations that would eliminate or reduce the risk so that it would be safe for the employee to return to the workplace while still permitting performance of essential functions. This can involve an interactive process with the employee. If there are not accommodations that permit this, then an employer must consider accommodations such as telework, leave, or reassignment (perhaps to a different job in a place where it may be safer for the employee to work or that permits telework). An employer may only bar an employee from the workplace if, after going through all these steps, the facts support the conclusion that the employee poses a significant risk of substantial harm to himself that cannot be reduced or eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\n\nG.5. What are examples of accommodation that, absent undue hardship, may eliminate (or reduce to an acceptable level) a direct threat to self?\n\n(5/5/20)\n\nAccommodations\n\nmay include additional or enhanced protective gowns, masks, gloves, or other gear beyond what the employer may generally provide to employees returning to its workplace. Accommodations also may include additional or enhanced protective measures, for example, erecting a barrier that provides separation between an employee with a disability and coworkers/the public or increasing the space between an employee with a disability and others. Another possible reasonable accommodation may be elimination or substitution of particular \u201cmarginal\u201d functions (less critical or incidental job duties as distinguished from the \u201cessential\u201d functions of a particular position). In addition, accommodations may include temporary modification of work schedules (if that decreases contact with coworkers and/or the public when on duty or commuting) or moving the location of where one performs work (for example, moving a person to the end of a production line rather than in the middle of it if that provides more social distancing).\n\nThese are only a few ideas. Identifying an effective accommodation depends, among other things, on an employee\u2019s job duties and the design of the workspace. An employer and employee should discuss possible ideas; the Job Accommodation Network (\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n) also may be able to assist in helping identify possible accommodations. As with all discussions of reasonable accommodation during this pandemic, employers and employees are encouraged to be creative and flexible.\n\nG.6. As a best practice, and in advance of having some or all employees return to the workplace, are there ways for an employer to invite employees to request flexibility in work arrangements?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nYes. The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act permit employers to make information available in advance to\n\nall\n\nemployees about who to contact\u2014if they wish\u2014to request accommodation for a disability that they may need upon return to the workplace, even if no date has been announced for their return. If requests are received in advance, the employer may begin the\n\ninteractive process\n\n. An employer may choose to include in such a notice all the CDC-listed medical conditions that may place people at higher risk of serious illness if they contract COVID-19, provide instructions about who to contact, and explain that the employer is willing to consider on a case-by-case basis any requests from employees who have these or other medical conditions.\n\nAn employer also may send a general notice to all employees who are designated for returning to the workplace, noting that the employer is willing to consider requests for accommodation or flexibilities on an individualized basis. The employer should specify if the contacts differ depending on the reason for the request \u2013 for example, if the office or person to contact is different for employees with disabilities or pregnant workers than for employees whose request is based on age or child-care responsibilities.\n\nEither approach is consistent with the ADEA, the ADA, and the May 29, 2020\n\nCDC guidance\n\nthat emphasizes the importance of employers providing accommodations or flexibilities to employees who, due to age or certain medical conditions, are at higher risk for severe illness.\n\nRegardless of the approach, however, employers should ensure that whoever receives inquiries knows how to handle them consistent with the different federal employment nondiscrimination laws that may apply, for instance, with respect to accommodations due to a medical condition, a religious belief, or pregnancy.\n\nG.7. What should an employer do if an employee entering the worksite requests an alternative method of screening due to a medical condition?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThis is a request for reasonable accommodation, and an employer should proceed as it would for any other request for accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. If the requested change is easy to provide and inexpensive, the employer might voluntarily choose to make it available to anyone who asks, without going through an interactive process. Alternatively, if the disability is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask the employee for information to establish that the condition is a\n\ndisability\n\nand what specific limitations require an accommodation. If necessary, an employer also may request medical documentation to support the employee\u2019s request, and then determine if that accommodation or an alternative effective accommodation can be provided, absent undue hardship.\n\nSimilarly, if an employee requested an alternative method of screening as a religious accommodation, the employer should determine if accommodation is\n\navailable under Title VII\n\n.\n\nH. Age\n\nH.1. The\n\nCDC has explained\n\nthat individuals age 65 and over are at higher risk for a severe case of COVID-19 if they contract the virus and therefore has encouraged employers to offer maximum flexibilities to this group. Do employees age 65 and over have protections under the federal employment discrimination laws?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals age 40 and older. The ADEA would prohibit a covered employer from involuntarily excluding an individual from the workplace based on his or her being 65 or older, even if the employer acted for benevolent reasons such as protecting the employee due to higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nUnlike the ADA, the ADEA does not include a right to reasonable accommodation for older workers due to age. However, employers are free to provide flexibility to workers age 65 and older; the ADEA does not prohibit this, even if it results in younger workers ages 40-64 being treated less favorably based on age in comparison.\n\nWorkers age 65 and older also may have medical conditions that bring them under the protection of the ADA as individuals with disabilities. As such, they may request reasonable\n\naccommodation for their disability\n\nas opposed to their age.\n\nH.2. If an employer is choosing to offer flexibilities to other workers, may older comparable workers be treated less favorably based on age?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 12)\n\nNo. If an employer is allowing other comparable workers to telework, it should make sure it is not treating older workers less favorably based on their age.\n\nI. Caregivers/Family Responsibilities\n\nI.1. If an employer provides telework, modified schedules, or other benefits to employees with school-age children due to school closures or distance learning during the pandemic, are there sex discrimination considerations?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nEmployers may provide any flexibilities as long as they are not treating employees differently based on sex or other EEO-protected characteristics. For example, under Title VII, female employees cannot be given more favorable treatment than male employees because of a gender-based assumption about who may have\n\ncaretaking responsibilities\n\nfor children.\n\nJ. Pregnancy\n\nJ.1. Due to the pandemic, may an employer exclude an employee from the workplace involuntarily\n\ndue to pregnancy\n\n?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nNo. Sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act includes discrimination based on pregnancy. Even if motivated by benevolent concern, an employer is not permitted to single out workers on the basis of pregnancy for adverse employment actions, including involuntary leave, layoff, or furlough.\n\nJ.2.\n\nIs there a right to accommodation based on pregnancy during the pandemic?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThere are two federal employment discrimination laws that may trigger\n\naccommodation for employees based on pregnancy\n\n.\n\nFirst, pregnancy-related medical conditions may themselves be disabilities under the ADA, even though pregnancy itself is not an ADA disability. If an employee makes a request for reasonable accommodation due to a pregnancy-related medical condition, the employer must consider it under the usual ADA rules.\n\nSecond, Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifically requires that women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions be treated the same as others who are similar in their ability or inability to work. This means that a pregnant employee may be entitled to job modifications, including telework, changes to work schedules or assignments, and leave to the extent provided for other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work. Employers should ensure that supervisors, managers, and human resources personnel know how to handle such requests to avoid disparate treatment in violation of Title VII.\n\nK. Vaccinations\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccinations may raise questions about the applicablilty of various equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws, including the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, GINA, and Title VII, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (see\n\nSection J, EEO rights relating to pregnancy\n\n).\u00a0 The EEO laws do not interfere with or prevent employers from following CDC or other federal, state, and local public health authorities\u2019 guidelines and suggestions.\n\nADA and Vaccinations\n\nK.1. For any COVID-19 vaccine that has been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine to an employee by an employer (or by a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine) a \u201cmedical examination\u201d for purposes of the ADA?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo. \u00a0The vaccination itself is not a medical examination.\u00a0 As the Commission explained in\n\nguidance on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations\n\n, a medical examination is \u201ca procedure or test usually given by a health care professional or in a medical setting that seeks information about an individual\u2019s physical or mental impairments or health.\u201d\u00a0 Examples include \u201cvision tests; blood, urine, and breath analyses; blood pressure screening and cholesterol testing; and diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs.\u201d \u00a0If a vaccine is administered to an employee by an employer for protection against contracting COVID-19, the employer is not seeking information about an individual\u2019s impairments or current health status and, therefore, it is not a medical examination.\n\nAlthough the administration of a vaccination is not a medical examination, pre-screening vaccination questions may implicate the ADA\u2019s provision on disability-related inquiries, which are inquiries likely to elicit information about a disability.\u00a0 If the employer administers the vaccine, it must show that such pre-screening questions it asks employees are \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d\n\nSee Question K.2\n\n.\n\nK.2. According to the CDC, health care providers should ask certain questions before administering a vaccine to ensure that there is no medical reason that would prevent the person from receiving the vaccination. If the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination from the employer (or a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine) and asks these screening questions, are these questions subject to the ADA standards for disability-related inquiries?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nYes.\u00a0 Pre-vaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about a disability.\u00a0 This means that such questions, if asked by the employer or a contractor on the employer\u2019s behalf, are \u201cdisability-related\u201d under the ADA.\u00a0 Thus, if the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination, administered by the employer, the employer must show that these disability-related screening inquiries are \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d \u00a0To meet this standard, an employer would need to have a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that an employee who does not answer the questions and, therefore, does not receive a vaccination, will pose a direct threat to the health or safety of her or himself or others.\n\nSee Question K.5.\n\nbelow for a discussion of direct threat.\n\nBy contrast, there are two circumstances in which disability-related screening questions can be asked without needing to satisfy the \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d requirement.\u00a0 First, if an employer has offered a vaccination to employees on a voluntary basis (i.e. employees choose whether to be vaccinated), the ADA requires that the employee\u2019s decision to answer pre-screening, disability-related questions also must be voluntary.\n\n42 U.S.C. 12112(d)(4)(B)\n\n;\n\n29 C.F.R. 1630.14(d)\n\n. \u00a0If an employee chooses not to answer these questions, the employer may decline to administer the vaccine but may not retaliate against, intimidate, or threaten the employee for refusing to answer any questions. \u00a0Second, if an employee receives an employer-required vaccination from a third party that does not have a contract with the employer, such as a pharmacy or other health care provider, the ADA \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d restrictions on disability-related inquiries would not apply to the pre-vaccination medical screening questions.\n\nThe ADA requires employers to keep any employee medical information obtained in the course of the vaccination program\n\nconfidential\n\n.\n\nK.3. Is asking or requiring an employee to show proof of receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination a disability-related inquiry?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo.\u00a0 There are many reasons that may explain why an employee has not been vaccinated, which may or may not be disability-related.\u00a0 Simply requesting proof of receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination is not likely to elicit information about a disability and, therefore, is not a disability-related inquiry.\u00a0 However, subsequent employer questions, such as asking why an individual did not receive a vaccination, may elicit information about a disability and would be subject to the pertinent ADA standard that they be \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d\u00a0 If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination from a pharmacy or their own health care provider, the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide any medical information as part of the proof in order to avoid implicating the ADA.\n\nADA and Title VII Issues Regarding Mandatory Vaccinations\n\nK.4. Where can employers learn more about Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) of COVID-19 vaccines?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nSome COVID-19 vaccines may only be available to the public for the foreseeable future under EUA granted by the FDA, which is different than approval under FDA vaccine licensure. The\n\nFDA has an obligation\n\nto:\n\n[E]nsure that recipients of the vaccine under an EUA are informed, to the extent practicable under the applicable circumstances, that FDA has authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, of the known and potential benefits and risks, the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown, that they have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine, and of any available alternatives to the product.\n\nThe FDA says that this information is typically conveyed in a patient fact sheet that is provided at the time of the vaccine administration and that it posts the fact sheets on its website.\u00a0 More information about EUA vaccines is available on the\n\nFDA\u2019s EUA page\n\n.\n\nK.5. If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available, how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccination because of a disability?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nThe ADA allows an employer to have a\n\nqualification standard\n\nthat includes \u201ca requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace.\u201d \u00a0However, if a safety-based qualification standard, such as a vaccination requirement, screens out or tends to screen out an individual with a disability, the employer must show that an unvaccinated employee would pose a direct threat due to a \u201csignificant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\u201d\n\n29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r)\n\n.\u00a0 Employers should conduct an individualized assessment of four factors in determining whether a direct threat exists: the duration of the risk; the nature and severity of the potential harm; the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and the imminence of the potential harm.\u00a0 A conclusion that there is a direct threat would include a determination that an unvaccinated individual will expose others to the virus at the worksite. \u00a0If an employer determines that an individual who cannot be vaccinated due to disability poses a direct threat at the worksite, the employer cannot exclude the employee from the workplace\u2014or take any other action\u2014unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent\n\nundue hardship\n\n) that would eliminate or reduce this risk so the unvaccinated employee does not pose a direct threat.\n\nIf there is a direct threat that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level,\n\nthe employer can exclude\n\nthe employee from physically entering the workplace, but this does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker.\u00a0 Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state, and local authorities. \u00a0For example, if an employer excludes an employee based on an inability to accommodate a request to be exempt from a vaccination requirement, the employee may be entitled to accommodations such as performing the current position remotely. This is the same step that employers take when physically excluding employees from a worksite due to a current COVID-19 diagnosis or symptoms; some workers may be entitled to telework or, if not, may be eligible to take leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, under the FMLA, or under the employer\u2019s policies.\n\nSee also\n\nSection J, EEO rights relating to pregnancy\n\n.\n\nManagers and supervisors responsible for communicating with employees about compliance with the employer\u2019s vaccination requirement should know how to recognize an accommodation request from an employee with a disability and know to whom the request should be referred for consideration. \u00a0Employers and employees should engage in a flexible, interactive process to identify workplace accommodation options that do not constitute an undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense). \u00a0This process should include determining whether it is necessary to obtain supporting documentation about the employee\u2019s disability and considering the possible options for accommodation given the nature of the workforce and the employee\u2019s position.\u00a0 The prevalence in the workplace of employees who already have received a COVID-19 vaccination and the amount of contact with others, whose vaccination status could be unknown, may impact the undue hardship consideration.\u00a0 In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees also may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website as a resource for different types of accommodations,\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n. \u00a0JAN\u2019s materials specific to COVID-19 are at\n\nhttps://askjan.org/topics/COVID-19.cfm\n\n.\n\nEmployers may rely on CDC recommendations when deciding whether an effective accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship is available, but as explained further in\n\nQuestion K.7.\n\n, there may be situations where an accommodation is not possible.\u00a0 When an employer makes this decision, the facts about particular job duties and workplaces may be relevant.\u00a0 Employers also should consult applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and guidance.\u00a0 Employers can find OSHA COVID-specific resources at:\n\nwww.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/\n\n.\n\nManagers and supervisors are reminded that it is unlawful to disclose that an employee is receiving a reasonable accommodation or retaliate against an employee for\n\nrequesting an accommodation\n\n.\n\nK.6. If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available, how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccination because of a sincerely held religious practice or belief?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nOnce an employer is on notice that an employee\u2019s sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance prevents the employee from receiving the vaccination, the employer must provide a reasonable accommodation for the religious belief, practice, or observance unless it would pose an undue hardship under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\u00a0 Courts have defined \u201cundue hardship\u201d under\n\nTitle VII\n\nas having more than a\n\nde minimis\n\ncost or burden on the employer. EEOC guidance explains that because the definition of religion is broad and protects beliefs, practices, and observances with which the employer may be unfamiliar, the employer should ordinarily assume that an employee\u2019s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief. \u00a0If, however, an employee requests a religious accommodation, and an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, practice, or observance, the employer would be justified in requesting additional supporting information.\n\nK.7. What happens if an employer cannot exempt or provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee who cannot comply with a mandatory vaccine policy because of a disability or sincerely held religious practice or belief?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nIf an employee cannot get vaccinated for COVID-19 because of a disability or sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, and there is no reasonable accommodation possible, then it would be lawful for the employer to\n\nexclude\n\nthe employee from the workplace. \u00a0This does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker.\u00a0 Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state, and local authorities.\n\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and Vaccinations\n\nK.8. Is Title II of GINA implicated when an employer administers a COVID-19 vaccine to employees or requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo. Administering a COVID-19 vaccination to employees or requiring employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination does not implicate Title II of GINA because it does not involve the use of genetic information to make employment decisions, or the acquisition or disclosure of \u201cgenetic information\u201d as defined by the statute. This includes vaccinations that use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which will be discussed more below.\u00a0 As noted in Question K.9. however, if administration of the vaccine requires pre-screening questions that ask about genetic information, the inquiries seeking genetic information, such as family members\u2019 medical histories, may violate GINA.\n\nUnder Title II of GINA, employers may not (1) use genetic information to make decisions related to the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, (2) acquire genetic information except in six narrow circumstances, or (3) disclose genetic information except in six narrow circumstances.\n\nCertain COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology. This raises questions about genetics and, specifically, about whether such vaccines modify a recipient\u2019s genetic makeup and, therefore, whether requiring an employee to get the vaccine as a condition of employment is an unlawful use of genetic information. \u00a0The CDC has explained that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines \u201cdo not interact with our DNA in any way\u201d and \u201cmRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.\u201d (See\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html\n\nfor a detailed discussion about how mRNA vaccines work).\u00a0 Thus, requiring employees to get the vaccine, whether it uses mRNA technology or not, does not violate GINA\u2019s prohibitions on using, acquiring, or disclosing genetic information.\n\nK.9. Does asking an employee the pre-vaccination screening questions before administering a COVID-19 vaccine implicate Title II of GINA?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nPre-vaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about disability, as discussed in\n\nQuestion K.2.\n\n, and may elicit information about genetic information, such as questions regarding the immune systems of family members.\u00a0 It is not yet clear what screening checklists for contraindications will be provided with COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nGINA defines \u201cgenetic information\u201d to mean:\n\nInformation about an individual\u2019s genetic tests;\n\nInformation about the genetic tests of a family member;\n\nInformation about the manifestation of disease or disorder in a family member (i.e., family medical history);\n\nInformation about requests for, or receipt of, genetic services or the participation in clinical research that includes genetic services by the an individual or a family member of the individual; and\n\nGenetic information about a fetus carried by an individual or family member or of an embryo legally held by an individual or family member using assisted reproductive technology.\n\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1635.3(c).\u00a0 If the pre-vaccination questions do\n\nnot\n\ninclude any questions about genetic information (including family medical history), then asking them does not implicate GINA.\u00a0 However, if the pre-vaccination questions\n\ndo\n\ninclude questions about genetic information, then employers who want to ensure that employees have been vaccinated may want to request proof of vaccination instead of administering the vaccine themselves.\n\nGINA does not prohibit an individual employee\u2019s own health care provider from asking questions about genetic information, but it does prohibit an employer or a doctor working for the employer from asking questions about genetic information.\u00a0 If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination from their own health care provider, the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide genetic information as part of the proof.\u00a0 As long as this warning is provided, any genetic information the employer receives in response to its request for proof of vaccination will be considered inadvertent and therefore not unlawful under GINA.\n\nSee\n\n29 CFR 1635.8(b)(1)(i) for model language that can be used for this warning.\n\nReturn to top\n\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\nEEOC Headquarters\n\n131 M Street, NE\n\nWashington, DC 20507\n\n202-663-4900 / (TTY) 202-663-4494\n\nQuestions?\n\nCall 1-800-669-4000\n\nFor Deaf/Hard of Hearing callers:\n\n1-800-669-6820 (TTY)\n\n1-844-234-5122 (ASL Video Phone)\n\ninfo@eeoc.gov\n\nFind your nearest EEOC office\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nSign up for email or text updates\n\nConnect With Us\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nRSS\n\nFOIA\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAccessibility\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\nUSA.gov\n",

immunity to SARs-CoV-2 due to more frequent prior coryzal infections from seasonal coronaviruses. Alternatively, close contact with children may increase risk of SARs-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether risk of infection with SARs-CoV-2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children.\n\nMethods\n\nWorking on behalf of NHS England, we conducted a population-based cohort study using primary care data and pseudonymously-linked hospital and intensive care admissions, and death records, from patients registered in general practices representing 40% of England. Using multivariable Cox regression, we calculated fully-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of outcomes from 1st February-3rd August 2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household.\n\nFindings\n\nAmong 9,157,814 adults \u226465 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults >65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure.\n\nInterpretation\n\nFor adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings have implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunding\n\nThis work was supported by the Medical Research Council MR/V015737/1.\n\nEvidence before this study\n\nWe searched MEDLINE on 19th October 2020 for population-based epidemiological studies comparing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in people living with and without children. We searched for articles published in 2020, with abstracts available, and terms \u201c(children or parents or dependants) AND (COVID or SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus) AND (rate or hazard or odds or risk), in the title, abstract or keywords. 244 papers were identified for screening but none were relevant. One additional study in preprint was identified on medRxiv and found a reduced risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection among adult healthcare workers living with children.\n\nAdded value of this study\n\nThis is the first population-based study to investigate whether the risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 differ between adults living in households with and without school-aged children during the UK pandemic. Our findings show that for adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes although there may be a slightly increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection for working-age adults living with children aged 12 to 18 years. Working-age adults living with children 0 to 11 years have a lower risk of death from COVID-19 compared to adults living without children, with the effect size being comparable to their lower risk of death from any cause. We observed no consistent changes in risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID-19 comparing periods before and after school closure.\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\n\nOur results demonstrate no evidence of serious harms from COVID-19 to adults in close contact with children, compared to those living in households without children. This has implications for determining the benefit-harm balance of children attending school in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCompeting Interest Statement\n\nBG has received research funding from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, the NHS National Institute for Health Research School of Primary Care Research, the Mohn-Westlake Foundation, Health Data Research UK (HDRUK), the Good Thinking Foundation, the Health Foundation, and the World Health Organisation; he also receives personal income from speaking and writing for lay audiences on the misuse of science.

One of its\n\ncontroversial activities\n\nis building artificial islands in disputed regions. See how reefs are being converted into military facilities.\n\nSubi Reef\n\nThe Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) says Subi Reef is China's northern-most outpost in the Spratly Island group and is just 25 kilometres from civilian populations of the Philippines.\n\nIt says China has reclaimed almost 4 million square metres of land and is possibly preparing to build a landing strip. It has already built a helipad, and possibly satellite and security infrastructure.\n\nIn its natural state, the reef was submerged at high tide.\n\nFiery Cross Reef\n\nAMTI estimates China has reclaimed nearly 3 million square metres at Fiery Cross Reef and its satellite imagery clearly shows the construction of an air strip is underway.\n\nThe landing strip is about 3,000 metres long, which would allow military aircraft to land, and AMTI says port facilities under construction may be large enough to dock military tankers.\n\nIt says development on the reef also includes cement plants, air defence guns, possible gun emplacements and radar towers, helipads and lighthouses.\n\nMischief Reef\n\nChina is believed to have begun land reclamation at Mischief Reef early this year, and has already reclaimed 5.5 million square metres.\n\nChina has military facilities and possible satellite communications antennas on the reef, and the access channel has been widened.\n\n\"Many have speculated that the by widening the entrance to the reef, China intends to create a naval base on the reclaimed reef,\" AMTI reports.\n\nGaven Reef\n\nChina has built an artificial island measuring about 300 metres by 250 metres at Gaven Reef in the Tizard Banks.\n\nA causeway links the island with a small facility that had long stood on the reef.\n\n\"China has had a troop and supply garrison on Gaven Reef as far back as 2003,\" AMTI reports. \"This has included a large supply platform where ships can dock, several gun emplacements, and radar and communications equipment.\"\n\nHughes Reef\n\nIHS Jane's estimates China has built a landmass of 75,000 square metres in the Spratly Islands, and equipment on the site includes an anti-aircraft tower.\n\nJohnson South Reef\n\nJohnson South Reef is a submerged reef, and has been converted into an artificial island about 400 metres wide in parts.\n\nThe site houses a multi-level military facility, possible radar facility and a small port.\n\nCuarteron Reef\n\nPhoto:\n\nAsia Maritime Transparency Initiative\n\nAMTI says this reef already hosted a concrete supply platform with radar and communications equipment, but China has now built an artificial island and other structures.\n\nIt estimates China has reclaimed 231,000 square metres, and built five possible communication antennas, a possible radar facility, two helipads, and five possible gun or missile emplacements.\n\nTopics:\n\nunrest-conflict-and-war\n\n,\n\nchina\n\n,\n\nphilippines\n\n,\n\nvietnam\n\nFirst posted\n\nSeptember 22, 2015 10:52:21\n\nContact Matt Liddy\n\nTop Stories\n\n'Total deviousness': Witnesses recount 'suspicious' inferno in the Luna Park Ghost Train\n\nFelicity was kept as a 'slave', caged and tattooed.

He believed Bitcoin would one day change the world and replace the dollar.\n\nBut now he sees a new force emerging - a payment system created by the Chinese state and known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP).\n\nIt's really a digital version of China's official currency, the yuan, and Mr Guo feels DCEP will become the dominant global currency. \"One day everyone in the world will be using DCEP,\" he says.\n\n\"DCEP will be successful because there are a lot of Chinese people living outside of China - there are 39 million Chinese living outside of the country.\n\n\"If they have a connection with China they will use the DCEP. They can make DCEP become an international currency.\"\n\nBut many question whether it will succeed and there are concerns that it will be used by Beijing to spy on citizens.\n\nmedia caption\n\nBitcoin explained: How do crypto-currencies work?\n\nLike Bitcoin, DCEP\n\nutilises a blockchain technology\n\n, a type of digitised ledger used to verify transactions.\n\nBlockchain acts as a universal record of every transaction ever made on that network, and users collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur.\n\nIn practice, that means users don't need a bank if, for example, they want to pay each other, perhaps with their phones.\n\nChina plans to launch DCEP later this year. But so far, the People's Bank of China has not given an exact date for the nationwide launch.\n\nChina began testing the digital currency earlier this year in selected cities. When rolled out it will allow users to link downloaded electronic wallets to their bank cards, make transactions and transfer money.\n\nimage copyright\n\nGetty Images\n\nimage caption\n\nThe new digital yuan will be controlled by the People's Bank of China\n\n\"It's hard to predict the timeline but the People's Bank of China is under a lot of pressure to accelerate the development because they do not want to be in a world where Libra\n\n(Facebook's digital currency)\n\nbecomes the global currency, which they think is worse than the current global financial system controlled by the US,\" says Linghao Bao, an analyst from Beijing-based Trivium.\n\nObservers say China wants to internationalise the yuan so that it can compete with the dollar.\n\n\"The Chinese government believes that if some other countries can also use the Chinese currency it can break the United States' monetary sovereignty. The United States has built the current global financial system and the instruments,\" says an anonymous Chinese cryptocurrency observer known as Bitfool.\n\nThe technology enthusiast worked in the venture capital sector before joining a number of Chinese internet companies. He started researching Bitcoin and believes that digital currencies represent the future of money.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\n'Lack of investment' behind delayed court cases\n\nHow photographers track down stolen pictures\n\nWhen changing a light bulb is a really big deal\n\nFans face closer tracking when stadiums reopen\n\nCan artificial intelligence create a decent dinner?\n\n\"Some traditional banking systems can't serve a poor country. In the traditional system, if you only have $10 a bank can't make money from you, but with digital currency, everyone has the right to enter. The threshold to enter is really low,\" he says.\n\nAlthough Facebook has\n\nscaled back its plans for Libra\n\n, it was still a concern for China. The social media giant plans to roll out an e-wallet known as Novi later this year. It will work as a standalone app but can also be available on Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\n\"The two sides are definitely involved in financial warfare even though no large confrontation has happened yet,\" says Linghao Bao.\n\nObservers like Bitfool believe that China is already further ahead of the US in the battle for the future of money.\n\nChina's digital payment systems are widely seen as the most advanced in the world.\n\nThe country is on the verge of becoming a cashless society. In 2019, four out of every five payments in China were made through either Tencent's WeChat Pay or Alibaba's Alipay.\n\nimage copyright\n\nGetty Images\n\nimage caption\n\nThe new currency could be big if Chinese communities outside China adopt it\n\n\"America is the leader of the global financial system. But they don't have the motivation like China to make the change [to a digital currency],\" says Bitfool.\n\n\"China wants to share that power. But for America, Libra is just a backup plan.\n\n\"In poor countries and also in China there are a lot of people who live in villages. They have very little money but they are using smartphones. If you can buy a smartphone you can use DCEP.\"\n\nHowever, DCEP will be centralised and state-run, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum which are free of state control.\n\nimage copyright\n\nChandler Guo\n\nimage caption\n\nTo create a significant amount of cryptocurrency you need a lot of computing power\n\nMany Bitcoin enthusiasts fear that DCEP will be used as a tool by the Chinese Communist Party to exert greater control over their citizens through surveillance. The authorities will be able to monitor how money is spent in real time. They will also have the same controls over DCEP as with the yuan.\n\nThe yuan is tightly controlled by Beijing and its exchange rate is the source of much tension between the US and China. The US accuses China of\n\nkeeping the yuan weak to benefit its economy.\n\n\"DCEP is the antithesis of Bitcoin. The ultimate goal of a cryptocurrency is the separation of money and state,\" says Stewart Mackenzie, a cryptocurrency expert based in Hong Kong. \"It's easy for them to say that it's like Bitcoin when it's worlds apart.\"\n\nLinghao Bao agrees. \"DCEP is built on an idea of centralised control. The value of Bitcoin lies in its decentralisation nature and its isolation from the financial system,\" Mr Bao says.\n\n\"I trust Bitcoin more. Because it really belongs to me,\" says Bitfool.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nChina\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nHong Kong\n\nBitcoin\n\nTop Stories\n\nGeorge Floyd's girlfriend recalls first meeting\n\nCourteney Ross gives emotional testimony during the fourth day of Derek Chauvin's murder trial.\n\nPublished\n\n1 hour ago\n\nChildren dropped over US border wall.

Yet, Xi\u2019s outward strongman image is a veneer over his inner insecurity. When he came into power in late 2012, China\u2019s economy had slowed down from double-digit growth to single-digit growth; the mass working-age population, which had been the engine of China\n\n\u2019\n\ns economic growth, has begun to decline. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington, D.C.\u2013based think tank,\n\nprojects\n\nthat by 2030, \u201cChina will round out its thinning labor force by hiring workers from abroad.\u201d At the same time, according to Mark Haas, a political-science professor at Duquesne University, \u201cChina alone in 2050 will have more than 329 million people over 65.\u201d Consequently, China is expected to be the first major economy that will grow older before it achieves widespread prosperity.\n\nWithout its demographic dividend and with an aging population, China\u2019s economic growth will further slow down at the time when the government needs to keep its growing middle class from demanding a level of political freedom matching their newfound wealth. An aging population would also force the government to allocate more national resources for elder care and social services, which means there will be fewer resources to compete against the U.S. This is probably one of the most important reasons why Xi feels that he has to abandon the so-called strategic-patience guidance issued by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1997, who instructed his comrades to bide their time and avoid any confrontation with powerful external forces until China was in a much stronger position both economically and militarily.\n\nXi, however, believes that China can\u2019t afford to bide its time any longer. It must replace the liberal world order with a Sino-centric world order before China\n\n\u2019\n\ns population becomes too old and the Chinese economy becomes too stagnant. However, rather than furthering economic reform and opening up more sectors to foreign investment and competition to strengthen its economy, Xi chose to hide China\u2019s weaknesses and exaggerate China\u2019s economic strengths. He emphasizes self-reliance and utilizing China\u2019s resources to pump up \u201cnational champions,\u201d or state-owned enterprises that could compete against global leaders in strategic sectors. Xi feels that nationalism is his new trump card, something he can use to motivate, excite, and unite a billion people all the while strengthening the CCP\u2019s rule over them. Others say that his inward-looking nationalist policies are leading China to the very\n\nmiddle-income trap\n\n\u2014 in which China\u2019s level of development stalls out before reaching the heights of other modern industrial nations \u2014 that Xi and his predecessors tried very hard to avoid.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet the more the Chinese economy slows down, the more Xi feels the need to project a strongman image both abroad and, especially, at home. As Wang Gungwu and Zheng Yongnian, two Chinese scholars, wrote in\n\nChina and the New International Order\n\n, this dynamic has deep roots in Chinese history: \u201cChina\u2019s internal order was so closely related to her international order that one could not long survive without the other; when the barbarians were not submissive abroad, rebels might more easily arise within. Most dynasties collapsed under the twin blows of inside disorder and outside calamity,\n\nnei luan wai hu\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\n, that is, domestic rebellion and foreign invasion.\u201d\n\nXi is keenly aware that he is vulnerable to internal rebellion. He has purged more than 1.5 million government officials, military leaders, and party elites. His trade war with the U.S. is deeply unpopular inside China because it has caused economic pains such as rising unemployment, closing of factories, and the shifting of the global supply chain out of China. Xi knows very well that if he shows any signs of weakness, he may end up like his political rival, Bo Xilai \u2014 a princeling who is currently languishing in a notorious Chinese prison for high-level party officials.\n\nIn addition, Xi saw former U.S. President Obama as a \u201cweak\u201d leader who led a nation that was on its way to inevitable decline, which opened up an unprecedented opportunity for China. Xi also has certain milestones he wants to reach: In 2021, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, and in 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of Communist China. Xi wants to do something big to cement his place in history when he reaches these milestones. Therefore, in his mind, the era of hiding strength and biding time is over. He wants to show the world a new set of policies, actions, and attitudes that match China\u2019s powerful status.\n\nFor a while, Xi was succeeding. Internally, he ruthlessly cracked down on religious believers, political dissenters, party officials, and business elites. He also built a mass surveillance state that turned the dystopian nightmare imagined by George Orwell\u2019s\n\n1984\n\ninto a reality. Internationally, he imposed his strong will on businesses and nations big and small through his signature project \u201cOne Belt and One Road.\u201d The way Xi sees it, the more other countries become economically dependent on China, the more he can dominate them peacefully without having to use force. One commentator\n\nhas observed\n\nthat Xi \u201cresembles a clenched fist. At home, he is clenching hard to assert his control. To the outside world, he is a hard-thrusting force determined to get his way.\u201d Xi\u2019s fist has conditioned many nations including the Western democracies to believe that China is stronger than it actually is and that China\u2019s global dominance is inevitable. Therefore, few are willing to challenge China\u2019s human-rights violations at home and its assertive behavior abroad.\n\nBut even the most powerful emperor can fly too close to the sun. The dissenting voices inside China are getting louder, while global backlash against China reached new heights in 2019. Then the 2020 coronavirus outbreak stripped the facade of Xi\u2019s powerful image, revealed deep flaws within the CCP\u2019s dictatorial political system, caused immense anger and frustration among Chinese people, brought serious detriments to China\u2019s prestigious international image, and brought China\u2019s seemingly unstoppable rise to a halt. As the prominent Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai has written, \u201cThe more Mr. Xi pursues his authoritarian agenda, the more distrust he will sow at home and abroad. Far from transforming Beijing into the world\u2019s leading superpower, his policies will instead keep China from taking its rightful place of honor in a peaceful, modern and integrated world.\u201d Xi has misread the situation, overplayed his hand, and his aggressive policies at home and abroad have backfired, proving the saying: Those whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.\n\nMore from National Review\n\nWolf Warrior II Tells Us a Lot about China\n\nDo Autocracies Really Have an Advantage over Democracies?\n\nChina Accelerates Its Crackdown on Foreign Journalists\n\n{\n        \"caasUrl\": \"https://www.yahoo.com/caas/content/article/\",\n        \"contextParams\": \"\"\n    }\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nYahoo News\n\n'Skullduggery' political podcast: Prosecuting the police \u2014 March 31, 2021\n\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd is underway in Minneapolis, and it represents a moment of grave importance in the fight against police brutality and abuse of power.\n\n2d ago\n\nReuters\n\nCCTV shows couple in Seoul daubing over $500,000 graffiti artwork\n\n(Reuters) -A couple in South Korea accused of damaging artwork by American graffiti artist JonOne said they had mistakenly thought they were allowed to daub paint on the piece as \"participatory art\", the head of the exhibition said on Friday.

Never mind that as one of the finest baritones in the world his booming voice makes it hard to be discreet.\u201cThe truth about opera singers is that food and drinks are pretty much the only topic we discuss. When they know you\u2019ve been hired to sing in a new opera house, your musician friends will give you their list,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhere to get the best t\u00e4ffelspitz with cream spinach if you\u2019re in Vienna. The address of Pavarotti\u2019s cook in Genova. The best wine bar in Madrid. Believe me, nobody knows food and drinks like an opera singer.\u201dCan the Roaring Twenties Teach Us About Post-Pandemic Life?How to Avoid Overhyped and Overpriced BourbonSuch is the unconventional life of travel led by opera singers, or at least was before the spread of Covid-19. And that life also came with its spells of homesickness. \u201cI remember my debut at the Met,\u201d says T\u00e9zier. \u201cIt was the year 2000 and I was singing Escamillo in Carmen. I loved New York City right away but food wise, it was challenging. The Parmigiano cheese I found at my local supermarket was from Cincinnati. So, when my American agent asked me to stay one more week for a televised concert\u2014the opportunity of a lifetime she insisted\u2014I said no way, I\u2019m out of here. I need to go back home for real cheese! She thought I was nuts. Obviously, the New York food scene has changed a lot since then, only for the better.\u201dIn the last 20 years, 52-year old T\u00e9zier has been back at the Metropolitan Opera many times, most notably in Donizetti\u2019s Lucia di Lammermoor as the main character\u2019s villainous father. (This 2011, production is currently available for streaming on the Met\u2019s website.)In December, providing Lincoln Center reopens in time, T\u00e9zier is set to sing the tragic title role in Rigoletto, one of Verdi\u2019s finest operas. The great Italian composer is very much on T\u00e9zier\u2019s mind these days as shown by his exquisite first solo album simply titled Verdi (Sony Classical), which was just released this winter. \u201cWe recorded in Bologna, which is one of the very best places to eat and drink in the world. I mean Luciano [Pavarotti] grew up a few miles away in Modena. That says it all.\u201dFor T\u00e9zier, his love of food and drink began by the Mediterranean where he grew up on France\u2019s beautiful coast. He still speaks with a warm and musical accent common in his hometown of Marseilles. \u201cWhat really rocked my world was a summer holiday in the Gers region, that\u2019s in the Southwest of France. We were staying on a farm and believe me, there was a depth of knowledge there,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember this woman, beautifully-named Z\u00e9lie. What a cook! She prepared zucchini flowers fritters that were heavenly. With the male flowers, mind you, because if you use the females you ruin the chain of reproduction. And she made incredible pastries in her wood oven. The thin dough was filled with crab apples in an Armagnac sauce.\u201d GREGOR HOHENBERG/SONY MUSIC Since then, the famed brandy has remained a personal favorite of his. \u201cI remember the locals pouring Armagnac in balloon glasses, savoring it and talking about the variety of tastes they perceived. I remember the wonderful, vanilla-like smell of the alcohol maturing in the oak barrels. And seeing the transparent color of the [unaged] brandy presented in a thimble for everybody to admire and the mahogany colors of the mature one. Beautiful memories.\u201dIs there a vocal benefit to drinking before a concert or is liquor a singing hazard? \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the urban legends,\u201d T\u00e9zier admits. \u201cNamely that you should drink whiskey to get a lower register or a glass of Bordeaux to lubricate the vocal cords. Personally, I don\u2019t do any of it for the same reason that an athlete doesn\u2019t drink before a game. Alcohol stiffens the muscles and that\u2019s all the vocal cords are, it\u2019s pretty simple. So, I enjoy a nice drink after a show or on my downtime in Alsace.\u201dMangia! Inside Luciano Pavarotti\u2019s Italian KitchenT\u00e9zier, his wife, the soprano Cassandre Berthon, and their young son, have settled into a house near wine country in Dorlisheim, which is not too far from Strasburg. \u201cA guy from Marseilles who finds a home in Alsace, it\u2019s not that common, but it\u2019s my story,\u201d says T\u00e9zier. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of the savoir faire of these winemakers who are our neighbors. I can recommend the Rangen de Thann for instance, a wonderful, joyous white wine. It is also a rarity because the workers have to rope down the hill to collect the grapes. A wine like that can produce in you great emotions. Pretty much like music. There is great music all around\u2026and then there is Mozart.\u201dSo if Rangen de Thann goes with Mozart, then what do you drink while listening to Verdi\u2019s operas? T\u00e9zier doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cA glass of Amarone della Valpolicella,\u201d he says. \u201cSpicy and deep, with a touch of a violent, beastly feeling to it\u2026That wine is pure Verdi.\u201dRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Poor old Joe Biden. He might have won the electoral college and the popular vote but he\u2019ll never feel the love of his underlings like Donald Trump did. The former president\u2019s first full cabinet meeting in June 2017 remains an unparalleled opera of oleaginousness. Secretary after secretary all but flung themselves at his feet, sang songs of praise and paid homage to the divine emperor of the universe. Has any parent ever known such undying adoration from their child? Only King Lear from Goneril and Regan, perhaps. And most telling was the fact that the world was allowed to see it. Trump made sure it was one more chapter in his reality TV presidency. Not really Biden\u2019s style. His first cabinet meeting on Thursday was relocated to the East Room because of coronavirus restrictions \u2013 the 16 permanent members wore face masks and sat in a giant square with empty chairs between them \u2013 but was otherwise a return to the staid old way of doing things. The main item on the agenda was not the American president\u2019s sculpted handsomeness, nor his towering intellect, nor his indubitable virility, nor his ability to hit holes in one, but merely his freshly announced $2tn infrastructure plan. Flanked by the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, with the vice-president, Kamala Harris, opposite, Biden said he was asking five cabinet members to \u201ctake special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public\u201d. He took no questions from the media and, after less than two and a half minutes, reporters were ushered out. \u201cI thank the press for being here, but I\u2019ll talk to you all later.\u201d The 16 permanent members wore face masks and sat in a giant square with empty chairs between them. Photograph: Leigh Vogel/EPA But even this brief glimpse behind the curtain spoke volumes about how much has changed. White men composed nearly three-quarters of Trump\u2019s cabinet; they make up only a third of Biden\u2019s. On Thursday the East Room included Harris, the first woman and first woman of colour to serve as vice-president; Janet Yellen, the first woman to lead the treasury department; Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay secretary confirmed to the cabinet; and Deb Haaland, the first Native American in a president\u2019s cabinet. \u201cThis is the first in American history that the cabinet looks like America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we promised we were going to do, and we\u2019ve done it.\u201d If Trump represented a backlash against America\u2019s first Black president, Biden\u2019s cabinet represents a backlash against the backlash. Their refusal to play to the cameras with ever escalating sycophancy was also a reminder that the reality TV presidency did not get renewed for a second season. Ratings are down and, such is the absence of scandals, Biden\u2019s pet dogs are making news for biting people and depositing poo in a White House hallway. Cabinet members like Tom Vilsack and Denis McDonough simply can\u2019t compete with Ben Carson or Rick Perry for comic effect. Spare a thought for the late-night comedians suddenly going cold turkey. How they feasted on that first Trump cabinet meeting, which began with Mike Pence declaring that it was \u201cthe greatest privilege of my life to serve as the vice-president to the president who is keeping his word to the American people\u201d. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, followed up: \u201cWe thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you\u2019ve given us to serve your agenda.\u201d As Trump went around the room, nearly every secretary strove to outdo the one before in the olympics of obsequiousness. Late-night comedian Stephen Colbert summed up: \u201cThese are adults, some of them are billionaires, and they\u2019re just happy to have their leashes yanked as the cameras roll for the dear leader. \u201cI did not know that Trump has such a strict \u2018please check your balls at the door\u2019 policy. Honestly, this is next-level weird. This is an unprecedented public stroke-fest for an emotionally frail man.\u201d It was, of course, funny until it wasn\u2019t. In a country where politics is the new religion, with all its faith and fervour and absolutes, worship of that particular Messiah led all the way to the deadly storming of the US Capitol on 6 January. Ordinary Joe is more in the vein of Bertolt Brecht: unhappy the land that is in need of heroes.\n\n16h ago\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nBiden wants to spend $100 billion to get you better internet access, then $174 billion so you can take an electric vehicle anywhere\n\nPresident Joe Biden's infrastructure plan would wire up every corner of the nation with access to broadband for internet and EV charging stations.\n\n18h ago\n\nMore Stories\n\nTRENDING\n\nNBC News\n\nJill Biden pulls off April Fools' Day prank on media, staff\n\nNBC News\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 min read\n\nABC News\n\nRemains of missing 10-year-old girl found in rural Iowa, police say\n\nABC News\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 min read\n\nReuters\n\n'Every step of the way': McConnell pledges battle over Biden infrastructure plan\n\nReuters\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 min read\n\nThe New York Times\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Your Vaccine Card\n\nThe New York Times\n\n\u00b7\n\n7 min read\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDaughter: Bystander disrupted attack on Asian American woman\n\nAssociated Press\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 min read\n\nPOPULAR\n\n'Skullduggery' political podcast: Prosecuting the police \u2014 March 31, 2021\n\nYahoo News\n\nCCTV shows couple in Seoul daubing over $500,000 graffiti artwork\n\nReuters\n\nBlue Jays beat Yankees 3-2 in 10th inning as fans return\n\nAssociated Press\n\n56 celebrities you probably forgot guest-starred on 'How I Met Your Mother'\n\nINSIDER\n\nStokes twins: YouTubers plead guilty over fake bank robbery\n\nBBC\n\nThese Modern Dressers Prove That Style and Function Are One and the Same\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nEU urges China to ensure freedom of speech after BBC journalist leaves country\n\nReuters\n\nA deer crashed through the windshield of a school bus in Virginia and landed on a student, video shows\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOxfam suspends two aid workers amid sex exploitation claims in DR Congo\n\nBBC\n\nPlant Art Is the Logical Next Step in Our Flora Obsession\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nOpposition grows against UK vaccine passports\n\nReuters\n\nAll the CEOs that have spoken out against Georgia's new voting restrictions\n\nAxios\n\nNobody Knows Food and Drinks like an Opera Singer\n\nThe Daily Beast\n\nKremlin says that any NATO troop deployment to Ukraine would raise tensions\n\nReuters\n\n{\"geminiAds\":{\"geminiDedupeToken\":\"PHToken\"}}\n",

Well, that might no longer be the only option out there. A vertical farm just opened up in an old warehouse without windows in Copenhagen and it expects to produce 1,000 tons of produce per year by 2021, showing that vertical farms really do have a solid future.\n\nImage credit: Nordic Harvest\n\nThey won\u2019t see the light of day or have access to soil, but hundreds of tons of lettuce, herbs, and kale (among other produce) will soon be coming out of the vertical farm. The advantage of the vertical farm is that it takes less space than a conventional crop, helping to meet the world\u2019s food demand and producing food locally instead of importing it.\n\nAround 37%\n\nof the earth\u2019s landmass is used for agriculture, according to the World Bank. But climate change and conflicts can challenge the availability of land for farming, not to even mention soil erosion \u2014 one of the major environmental issues that often fly under the radar.\n\nA quarter\n\nof the world\u2019s productive lands have already been degraded, according to the World Food Programme, challenging food security.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe project is run by YesHealth Group, a Taiwanese company with a long record developing vertical farming technology, in partnership with\n\nNordic Harvest\n\n, a Danish start-up that wants to use technology to make food production more sustainable. YesHealth already runs in Taiwan the largest vertical farm in China.\n\nIt\u2019s not actually a brand-new idea, as vertical farms have been around for almost a decade. They first took in Asia and the United States, which has the\n\nworld\u2019s biggest vertical farm\n\n, located in a steel mill in New Jersey and producing two million pounds of produce every year. But the idea is now also catching up in Europe.\n\nGet more science news like this...\n\nJoin the ZME newsletter for amazing science news, features, and exclusive scoops. More than 40,000 subscribers can't be wrong.\n\nDaily\n\nWeekly\n\nI have read and agree to the terms & conditions.\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\n\u201cWe offer a more sustainable way of producing food year-round, locally, without disturbing nature,\u201d founder of Nordic Harvest, Anders Riemann, told Reuters. \u201cWe take some of the food production back into the cities where you can grow in a much smaller land and space-optimized in the height.\u201d\n\nThe farm is installed in a 7,000 square meter hall and has 14 shelves of greens stacked up toward the ceiling in aluminum boxes. It\u2019s all automated, with robots used to move the shelves into position and stack the produce. When fully operational, the farm will be hermetically sealed to secure the farming conditions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImage credit: Nordic Harvest\n\nWater consumption will be between 90% and 95% lower compared to traditional farming. No artificial fertilizers, pesticides, or other toxic chemicals will be used. About 200 tons of produce will be harvested in the first quarter of 2021 but this would reach 1,000 annually when the farm runs at full capacity by end of 2021.\n\nThe project also addresses one of the frequent criticism vertical farms have, the fact that they require a vast amount of electricity to provide artificial light \u2014 but for Denmark, that won\u2019t be too big of a problem. The farm uses 20,000 specialized LEDs lightbulbs, manufactured by YesHealth, that are powered by renewable energy from Denmark\u2019s extensive wind farms.\n\n\u201cA vertical farm is characterized by not harming the environment by recycling all the water and nutrition or fertilizer,\u201d said Riemann. \u201cIn our case, we use 100% energy from windmills which makes us CO2-neutral.\u201d\n\nDenmark reported record-breaking wind power\n\nin 2019\n\n, covering 47% of the country\u2019s electricity demands for the entire year. Out of the 47%, most came from onshore (29%), although offshore also generated a healthy amount (18%). The country expects to keep expanding renewables as a way to reduce its emissions.\n\nEdit: The title of the article mistakenly stated that it is a wind farm.

Lung cancer is the malignant disease with highest incidence and also the leading cause of cancer mortality in the country. In 2005\u20132007, an average of 4234 new lung cancer cases and 4601 deaths from the disease were reported annually, for a crude mortality rate of 54.3 men and 27.3 women per 100,000 population. If present demographic trends and risk factors persist, lung cancer incidence and mortality can be expected to rise significantly in Cuba in the next five years.[1]\n\nRecognizing rising cancer incidence and mortality as a major public health problem, the Cuban Ministry of Public Health has implemented a Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (PICC, its acronym in Spanish), operating across all levels of the national public health system. This program constitutes a new therapeutic approach to the disease with biotechnology serving as a bridge between basic immunology research and public health. In Cuba, biotechnological research and development is conceived as a complete scientific cycle (closed loop), from concept to clinical application and marketing of scientific products. Income from product sales is invested in both sustaining use of immunotherapies in the national public health system and in research and development of new immunotherapeutic modalities.[2,3]\n\nAlthough chemotherapies have become an indispensable arsenal for reducing tumor burden and extending survival, their impact on lung cancer is measurable only in months with the added burden of severe adverse reactions. Lung cancer patients generally confront an initial stage of diagnosis and oncological treatment, during which complete or partial remission is achieved, followed by a second stage, during which the disease inexorably progresses toward terminal illness and death. The mechanism of action of immunotherapy products, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and therapeutic vaccines, is much more selective toward tumor cells and may increase cancer patient survival with improved quality of life.[3\u20135]\n\nThe Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a well-known oncogene. Its overactivation can induce malignant transformation of a normal cell, signaling inhibition of apoptosis, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis and tumor-induced proinflammatory and immunosuppressive processes. The EGFR signaling and transduction pathway can be efficiently interrupted by EGF deprivation, direct specific mAb receptor inhibition, or low molecular weight molecules competing intracellularly with adenosine triphospate (ATP) for the receptor\u2019s tyrosine kinase activity site, with negative repercussions on cell proliferation and, consequently, on tumor development.[6,7]\n\nInducing EGF deprivation by active immunotherapy is an emerging concept developed by Cuban researchers which involves manipulating an individual\u2019s immune response to release its own effector antibodies (Abs) against EGF, thereby reducing tumor size or preventing its progression.[8\u201313]\n\nCIMAvax EGF is a therapeutic anticancer vaccine developed entirely in Cuba. Its active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) are produced by the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (CIGB, its Spanish acronym); the vaccine is formulated at the Molecular Immunology Center (CIM, its Spanish acronym); and clinical trials are conducted in hospitals meeting professional and technological Good Clinical Practice standards.[14,15] Proof of principle (POP) of this novel therapy\u2019s clinical impact was made possible by the integration of Cuban biotechnological development in the public health system and collaboration between research institutes and hospitals.\n\nSince 1995, CIMAvax EGF has undergone five phase I/II and one phase II clinical trials. Results of these investigations led the Government Center for Quality Control of Medicines (CECMED, its Spanish acronym), the Cuban regulatory authority, to license this therapeutic vaccine for use in adult patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Research results have also been published in various national and international scientific journals.\n\nThe objective of this article is to review the pre-clinical and clinical research conducted during development of this novel Cuban therapeutic anticancer vaccine, based primarily on studies published by Cuban investigators in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\nMETHODS\n\nAn automated search of the PubMed database (Medline) through WHO\u2019s HINARI service was made using the key words \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cEGF\u201d. General selection criteria were articles published by Cuban authors in peer-reviewed international journals. Seventeen articles, published between January 1, 1994 and September 30, 2009, were found and reviewed for their coverage of concepts, clinical data and essential technological aspects of CIMAvax EGF development and potential impact on NSCLC. The main findings in each article were described and discussed, along with unpublished preliminary findings of an initial ongoing phase III clinical trial.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nVaccine Formulation and Clinical Induction of Immune Response against Autologous EGF\n\nWhen an individual is immunized with autologous EGF (from its own species), no anti-EGF antibody (Ab) response occurs. To prove the feasibility of manipulating an individual\u2019s immune response to induce an anti-EGF Ab response, reducing EGF concentration in blood and depriving the tumor of this growth factor,[8] a vaccine formulation was needed that would make EGF recognizable to the immune system, that is, render it immunogenic. Therefore, selection of an adequate immunopotentiator and adjuvant was required.\n\nIn 1992, preclinical studies were begun to select the most effective vaccine formulation for inducing autologous EGF immunogenicity. In this stage, components of the vaccine formulation were outlined, and the possibility of inducing effective autologous EGF immunogenicity was demonstrated. Different vaccine formulations were tried, and 2 immunopotentiating proteins were selected: tetanus toxoid (TT) and Neisseria meningitidis P64k (P64k), both produced in Cuba (Finlay Institute and CIGB, respectively). Two possible adjuvants were also proposed for clinical evaluation: aluminum hydroxide (Superfos, Denmark) and Montanide ISA 51 (Seppic, France).[13\u201314]\n\nClinical development of CIMAvax EGF began in 1995 with a phase I/II open-label clinical trial (Pilot 1) at the Medical-Surgical Research Center (CIMEQ, its Spanish acronym) in Havana. A non-randomized design was used in 10 patients with histologically proven primary malignant tumors in different locations, previously treated with first-line chemotherapy (ChTVV therapeutic schedule) (Table 1). The main objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity of the incipient vaccine formulation.[15]\n\nResults of this first clinical trial constituted the earliest published scientific evidence of the feasibility of inducing an immune response against autologous EGF in patients with different advanced stage tumors. Additionally, protein P64k was confirmed as the optimal immunopotentiator for EGF conjugation and the CIMAvax EGF formulation.\n\nSelection of NSCLC Target Location and Advanced Development of Vaccine Formulation\n\nA key factor in developing the final vaccine formulation was selection of the tumor location in which to introduce this novel therapeutic strategy. NSCLC was selected because of its frequency and because EGFR is overexpressed in tissues during development and progression of lung neoplasms in the following proportions: 62% of all NSCLC tumors, 89% of squamous cell tumors, 41% of adenocarcinomas and 80% of bronchoalveolar tumors. Magnitude of EGFR expression has been reported in the literature as a predictive factor of response to biological therapy in NSCLC patients.[6,8,11,16]\n\nThe next two phase I/II clinical trials (Pilot 2 and Pilot 3) were conducted jointly in overlapping periods (1997\u20131999 and 1998\u20132001, respectively) at CIMEQ and the National Oncology and Radiobiology Institute (INOR, its Spanish acronym), also in Havana (Table 1). Pilot 2 included 20 advanced stage NSCLC (IIIB/IV) patients; 10 were randomly immunized with EGF/P64k vaccine using aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant (EGF/P64k/AL), and 10 received EGF/P64k adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 51 (EGF/P64k/Montanide ISA 51).[17]\n\nThe Pilot 3 study also included 20 advanced stage NSCLC (IIIB/IV) patients who received the same treatments used in Pilot 2 (EGF/P64k/AL and EGF/P64k/Montanide ISA 51) with a similar randomization in 2 groups, except they all received a cyclophosphamide dose (200 mg/m2 of body surface) 72 hours before vaccine treatment onset.[17] Cyclophosphamide is a widely studied anticancer drug. Its immunomodulating effects have significant dose- and therapeutic schedule-related repercussions.[18,19] This pretreatment was introduced to disrupt immunologic tolerance to EGF and to induce immunogenicity toward this human molecule from the first dose.[17]\n\nThe Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 clinical trials confirmed that vaccination induced a specific anti-EGF Ab response and enabled classification of immunized patients into 2 subpopulations: poor antibody responders (PAR)\u2014those with poor anti-EGF Ab response\u2014and good antibody responders (GAR)\u2014those with an anti-EGF antibody response \u22651:4000 and at least 4 times (4x) their preimmunization levels. In both studies, survival was longest in the GAR group (mean, 12.41 months; median, 9.1 months), compared to mean, 5.47 months (median, 4.5 months), in PAR patients (Figure 1). The difference in survival was statistically significant (P <0.05). Six-month survival was achieved by 84% of GAR and 38% of PAR. Twelve-month survival was achieved by 37% of GAR and 4% of PAR. These studies also showed that patients with an anti-EGF Ab response \u226560\u00a0days survived longer than those whose response lasted <60 days.[17]\n\nTable 1: EGF Therapeutic Anticancer Vaccine Phase I/II Trials Conducted in Cuba, 1995\u20132005\n\nFigure 1: Survival Functions for Good Antibody Responders (GAR) and Poor Antibody Responders (PAR) to EGF Vaccination in 2 Pilot Phase I/II Clinical Trials (pooled data).[17]\n\nResults of the Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 phase I/II clinical trials confirmed greater immunogenicity with Montanide ISA 51 adjuvant (EGF/P64k/Montanide ISA 51) in the vaccine formulation, as well as the benefits of low-dose cyclophosphamide treatment 72 hours before the first immunization.[17,20]\n\nA 4th phase I/II clinical trial (Pilot 4), conducted at the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital (HAH) in Havana in 2000\u20132003, evaluated 2 dose levels of the therapeutic vaccine. Forty-three patients with advanced stage (IIIB/IV) NSCLC were randomized in 2 groups and received 71 \u00b5g or 142 \u00b5g of EGF (Table 1). The lower dose was applied in one deltoid region and the higher dose distributed between the 2 deltoid regions.[21]\n\nThe Pilot 4 study established a correlation between vaccine dose, anti-EGF Ab titers, EGF serum concentrations, and patient survival. Survival in treated patients (mean, 9.83 months; median, 8 months) significantly exceeded (p <0.05) the historical control (mean, 6.2 months; median, 4.1 months) while positively correlating with GAR titers (\u22651/4000) and lower serum EGF concentrations (<168 pg/ml). This clinical trial demonstrated for the first time that EGF serum concentration levels decrease when Ab titers rise.[21]\n\nReturn to Preclinical Research: Manipulating Immunopharmacological Variables and Fine Tuning the Therapeutic Schedule\n\nThe immunopharmacology of cancer vaccines is not yet fully understood, and there is scant data on immunopharmacological determinants influencing therapeutic anticancer vaccines.[22\u201328] Many variables must be evaluated, such as therapeutic schedules, administration route, dose, dosing interval, and optimal combination with already established therapies, among others. This process is even more complex when attempting to fine tune the therapy schedule of a vaccine based on a circulating self-molecule, such as autologous EGF, and induce an Ab response that suppresses it from circulation, thus depriving its receptor.\n\nFor CIMAvax EGF vaccine, more efficient strategies for inducing Ab response (priming) were needed, as well as for long-term response maintenance through reimmunization (boosting).[25\u201327] Investigators therefore returned to preclinical research using murine biomodels, defined as GAR (BALB/c mice) or PAR (C57BL6 mice), depending on their genetic background and antibody response when challenged with the vaccine. The animals were immunized with CIMAvax EGF vaccine (EGF/P64k/Montanide ISA 51), and some immunopharmacological variables (dose, number of immunizations, dosing interval) were manipulated during both the response induction phase (priming) and the reinforcement or reimmunization (boosting) phase, aimed at inducing an early, robust and prolonged anti-EGF Ab response, potentiating its active immune deprivation.[29]\n\nFor priming, fractioning an apparently low dose (4 \u00b5g) into 4 parts administered by intramuscular injection in different anatomical sites increased maximal Ab titer levels and extended the duration of vaccine response. Shortening the interval between booster doses reduced persistence of anti-EGF Ab titers, whereas repeated boosting converted PAR status to GAR.\n\nResults of this study led to the conclusion that the vaccine should be administered in a high but fractioned dose in multiple anatomical sites (such as the 2 deltoid and 2 gluteal regions), thereby bringing the EGF vaccine closer to regional lymph nodes and synergizing the immune response.[29]\n\nReturn to Clinical Trials: Combining Therapeutic Vaccination (V) and Chemotherapy (ChT)\n\nTumor biology is the result of cell genome interaction with environment; in addition to mutual influence, this interaction has repercussions in both reconfiguration of cell metabolism and evolutionary selection of more efficient tumor mechanisms. The immune system is one of the critical elements involved in shaping cell phenotype.[30\u201334]\n\nThe complexity of mechanisms involved in malignant transformation of cells lends itself to a combination therapy approach aimed at, among other things, simultaneously controlling tumor immunoevasion and dissemination. In this context, immunotherapies emerge as an approach that ensures greater specificity and limited associated toxicity. Immunotherapies have been included in standard cytotoxic therapeutic regimens since they were first developed. Passive mAb immunotherapy, in particular, has confirmed the potential of these combinations.[35\u201339] In this context, it was hypothesized that potentially autoreactive lymphocyte clones, capable of generating an autologous anti-EGF antibody response, reemerge from chemotherapy-induced maximum lymphocyte depletion (lymphopenia nadir), amplified with homeostatic advantage.[40,41]\n\nBased on these concepts and preclinical research results, a therapeutic schedule combining vaccine, chemotherapy and more vaccine (VChTV) was proposed. This schedule was evaluated in the 5th phase I/II clinical trial (Pilot 5) begun in 2001 in the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital (HAH) in Havana, using the CIMAvax EGF (EGF/P64k/Montanide ISA 51) formulation in 20 stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients. This study corroborated the correlation between an increase in anti-EGF Ab titers and a decrease in serum EGF concentration. Correlation between antibody titers and EGF/EGFR binding inhibition capacity was also shown, and GAR patient sera immunodominance against loop B of the EGF molecule was established.[42]\n\nAnother important finding in the Pilot 5 clinical trial was the differentiation of a new subpopulation of patients with anti-EGF antibody titers \u22651:64000, defined as super good antibody responders (sGAR). A correlation between Ab response and survival was also observed; sGAR patients survived significantly longer than patients classified as only GAR (Figure 2). This clinical finding tends to confirm the hypothesis that potentially autoreactive clones reemerge and amplify, possibly favoring active immunization with the VChTV therapeutic schedule.[42]\n\nFigure 2: Survival Functions of Super Good Antibody Responders (sGAR) Compared with Good Antibody Responders (GAR) to CIMAvax EGF Vaccine, Pilot Phase I/II Clinical Trial.[42]\n\nThese findings have led to a new line of preclinical research for evaluating the specific influence of each active immunotherapy combination with standard chemotherapy regimens, defining the immunopharmacological variables considered for rational design of combined therapeutic schedules, and establishing the specific impact of these combinations on T and B lymphocyte populations.[43]\n\nPhase II Clinical Trial: Proof of Principle and Licensing for NSCLC Therapy\n\nParallel to evaluation of the VChTV schedule, a 1st phase II controlled clinical trial was initiated in December 2001 to evaluate the survival effect of CIMAvax EGF (EGF/P64k/Montanide ISA 51) immunization in advanced stage (IIIB/IV) NSCLC patients previously treated with first-line chemotherapy (ChTVV).[44] This trial included 80 patients randomized 1:1 and was conducted in 4 Havana hospitals (HAH, CIMEQ, INOR and the Ben\u00e9fico Jur\u00eddico Hospital) and 5 provincial hospitals (III Congreso Hospital in Pinar del R\u00edo, Celestino Hern\u00e1ndez Hospital in Villa Clara, Mar\u00eda Curie Hospital in Camag\u00fcey, Vladimir Ilich Lenin Hospital in Holgu\u00edn, and Saturnino Lora Hospital in Santiago de Cuba).\n\nIn this phase II clinical trial, the safety profile observed in earlier phase I/II vaccine studies was confirmed. No grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (AE) were detected according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0.\n\nTable 2. EGF Vaccine-Related Adverse Events by Arm, Phase II Clinical Trial\n\nThe most frequent AE were fever, headache, chills and pain at the injection site (Table 2). Correlations between higher anti-EGF Ab titers and lower serum EGF concentrations, and between higher anti-EGF Ab titers and longer patient survival were also confirmed.\n\nMean survival was 19.47 months (median, 11.7 months) in GAR patients (n=20), 4.97 months (median, 3.6 months) in PARs (n=18), and 8.52 months (median, 5.33 months) in the control group (n=37). Longer survival was observed in all vaccinated patients compared to randomized unvaccinated controls, and the difference was significant (p <0.05) in the group aged <60 years (mean,18.53 months; median, 11.47 months in those vaccinated compared to mean, 7.55 months; median, 5.33 months in controls) (Figure 3).[44]\n\nFigure 3: Survival Functions for Patients Aged <60 Years, Phase II Clinical Trial.[44]\n\nLaboratory results associated with the CIMAvax EGF mechanism of action confirmed the EGF/EGFR binding inhibition capacity of vaccinated patient sera, and the capacity of vaccinated patient sera to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation was established for the first time. Additionally, survival was better among vaccinated patients whose sera inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, and was significantly better in patients whose sera preferentially recognized loop B of the EGF molecule.[45]\n\nThis phase II clinical trial contributed to the proof of principle of the therapeutic vaccination\u2019s clinical effect by demonstrating increased survival of CIMAvax EGF-vaccinated patients compared to the control group, and by demonstrating the feasibility of manipulating an individual\u2019s immune response to release its own effector Abs against EGF as a tumor growth factor, thereby reducing tumor size or preventing its progression.\n\nEvidence obtained from the 5 phase I/II clinical trials (Table 1) and the results of this phase II study led CECMED, the Cuban regulatory authority, to license CIMAvax EGF as a therapeutic vaccine indicated for adult advanced stage (IIIB/IV) NSCLC patients.[46]\n\nTechnological Development: Production and Quality Control Systems\n\nTechnological development of CIMAvax EGF therapeutic anticancer vaccine involved inducing autologous EGF immunogenicity by conjugating it with other molecules acting as immunopotentiators (P64k), selecting the most appropriate adjuvant (Montanide ISA 51) and increasing the quantity with each formulation, beginning with laboratory amounts used in preclinical studies and vaccination of the first patients, through scaling up to supply the ongoing phase III clinical trial in Cuba and other clinical trials abroad, as well as health system demand for use in treating patients.\n\nThe EGF used in the vaccine is a recombinant human growth factor (hu-rEGF). The P64k protein is also recombinant; both are produced by CIGB as active pharmaceutical ingredients and supplied to CIM, where they are chemically conjugated and the final vaccine formulation is prepared.\n\nParallel to the production process, physicochemical assays have been conducted to characterize the product at different stages of development, from POP to the current vaccine formulation.[47] Steps have been taken at each stage to guarantee comparability between different batches and different stages of development. Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) have been observed throughout the production and quality control process, which is audited and inspected by regulatory agencies from Cuba and other countries.\n\nConducting assays to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity has been particularly difficult. This type of assay is carried out in vivo. Autologous human EGF is foreign to other species. To overcome this challenge, NMRI mice were used. The genetic background of this outbred line of mice (no parental mating) makes it an adequate biomodel for representing the genetic variability of open human populations. Due to this particularity, NMRI mice only produce anti-EGF Ab responses when immunized with the whole vaccine formulation (EGF/P64k/Montanide ISA 51) and do not respond when immunized with the EGF molecule alone, that is, outside the vaccine formulation that makes it immunogenic.[47]\n\nOngoing Phase III Clinical Trial\n\nA phase III clinical trial has been underway since June 2006 at 18 clinical research sites throughout the country. The same ChTVV therapeutic schedule used in the phase II clinical trial is being used, but the vaccine is being distributed in 4 injection sites. This study is planned to recruit 579 advanced stage (IIIB/IV) NSCLC patients, with a 1:2 randomization (1 control patient for each 2 treated patients). Results will be evaluated in 2 patient strata: aged >60 years (n= 381) and aged \u226460 years (n=198).\n\nPreliminary results from 160 patients show numerical differences in 24-month survival rates. Graphic survival analysis in both strata and by protocol shows a trend towards delayed separation of the curves over time in favor of vaccinated patients compared to unvaccinated, as expected in survival evaluation of patients treated with therapeutic vaccines.[48\u201350] Although statistical significance of these differences has not yet been confirmed, they suggest possible benefit for patients treated with CIMAvax EGF vaccine.\n\nFuture Challenges\n\nEven though the survival benefit of therapeutic immunization with CIMAvax EGF in advanced stage NSCLC patients has been demonstrated, this evidence was obtained in a clinical trial context with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and specialized oncology service standards of care. The next stage in CIMAvax EGF vaccine development is the transition from specialized services to primary health care. To meet this objective, systematizing evidence of the vaccine\u2019s safety for chronic use needs to begin now.\n\nToday\u2019s oncology patients are the object of a therapeutic paradigm shift through which the sequential impact of immunotherapy combined with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy tends to prolong survival with an ethically acceptable quality of life.[3,4,48\u201350] Cancer is beginning to be approached as a 2-stage disease: the first stage begins with diagnosis, followed by very aggressive toxic treatment in a hospital setting, aimed at maximum reduction of tumor burden; the second stage begins when chemotherapy potential has been exhausted, progression is slow and continuous, prognosis depends on tumor progression speed, and the disease behaves like a chronic non-communicable condition requiring permanent care. It is in this second stage, when, due to their low toxicity, immunotherapies could be administered chronically in a primary care setting.\n\nFor CIMAvax EGF, meeting this challenge implies a transition from establishing proof of principle in clinical trials to making an impact on population health by prolonging survival of the approximately 4234 new NSCLC cases reported annually in Cuba and consequently reducing the number of deaths in the same period.\n\nAt the same time, the vaccine\u2019s effect needs to be evaluated in earlier NSCLC stages and in patients unfit for chemotherapy. Predictors are needed to indicate which NSCLC patient subpopulation may or may not respond to this immunotherapy. Moreover, benefits of administering CIMAvax EGF in other tumor locations\u2014such as prostate carcinoma, in which EGFR has a central role in the resistance mechanisms to androgenic blocking\u2014need to be evaluated.[51]\n\nReferences\n\nGal\u00e1n Y, Fern\u00e1ndez L, Torres P, Garc\u00eda M.

Coloured X-ray of the chest of an 84 year old woman with a malignant (cancerous) tumour (yellow) in the apex of the right lung (top left).\n\nDU CANE MEDICAL IMAGING LTD/Getty Images\n\nCuba has for several years had a promising therapeutic vaccine against lung cancer. The 55-year trade embargo led by the US made sure that Cuba was mostly where it stayed. Until---maybe---now.\n\nThe Obama administration has, of course, been trying to normalize relations with the island nation. And last month, during New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's visit to Havana, Roswell Park Cancer Institute finalized an agreement with Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology to develop a lung cancer vaccine and begin clinical trials in the US. Essentially, US researchers will bring the Cimavax vaccine stateside and get on track for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\"The chance to evaluate a vaccine like this is a very exciting prospect,\" says Candace Johnson, CEO of Roswell Park. She's excited, most likely, because research on the vaccine so far shows that it has low toxicity, and it's relatively cheap to produce and store. The Center for Molecular Immunology will give Roswell Park all of the documentation (how it's produced, toxicity data, results from past trials) for an FDA drug application; Johnson says she hopes to get approval for testing Cimavax within six to eight months, and to start clinical trials in a year.\n\nHow did Cuba end up with a cutting edge immuno-oncology drug? Though the country is justly famous for cigars, rum, and baseball, it also has some of the best and most inventive biotech and medical research in the world. That's especially notable for a country where the average worker earns $20 a month. Cuba spends a fraction of the money the US does on healthcare per individual; yet the average Cuban has a life expectancy on par with the average American. \"They've had to do more with less,\" says Johnson, \"so they've had to be even more innovative with how they approach things. For over 40 years, they have had a preeminent immunology community.\"\n\nDespite decades of economic sanctions, Fidel and Raul Castro made biotechnology and medical research, particularly preventative medicine, a priority. After the 1981 dengue fever outbreak struck nearly 350,000 Cubans, the government established the Biological Front, an effort to focus research efforts by various agencies toward specific goals. Its first major accomplishment was the successful (and unexpected) production of interferon, a protein that plays a role in human immune response. Since then, Cuban immunologists made several other vaccination breakthroughs, including their own vaccines for meningitis B and hepatitis B, and monoclonal antibodies for kidney transplants.\n\nThe thing about making such great cigars is, smoking is really, really bad for you. Lung cancer is the fourth-leading cause of the death in Cuba. Medical researchers at the Center for Molecular Immunology worked on Cimavax for 25 years before the Ministry of Health made it available to the public---for free---in 2011. Each shot costs the government about $1. A Phase II trial from 2008 showed lung cancer patients who received the vaccine lived an average of four to six months longer than those who didn't. That prompted Japan and some European countries to initiate Cimavax clinical trials as well.\n\nTo be fair, Cimavax probably won't be a game-changing cancer drug in its current form. The vaccine doesn't attack tumors directly, instead going after a protein that tumors produce which then circulates in the blood. That action spurs a person's body to release antibodies against a hormone called epidermal growth factor, which typically spurs cell growth but can also, if unchecked, cause cancer. (Although most people normally think of a vaccine as something that prevents a disease, technically a vaccine is a substance that stimulates the immune system in some way.) So the point of Cimavax is to keep lung tumors from growing and metastasizing, turning a late-stage growth into something chronic but manageable.\n\nBut in the US and Europe, people with lung cancer already have treatment options with the same goal. Roswell Park researchers say they plan to explore the vaccine's potential as a preventative intervention---making it more like a traditional vaccine. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor plays an important role in many other cancers, like prostate, breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer. \"All those things are potential targets for this vaccine,\" says Kelvin Lee, an immunologist at the company. Mostly for financial reasons, Cubans didn't test Cimavax that way at all.\n\nAnd that drug isn't the only one with potential in the Cuban pharmacopeia. Thomas Rothstein, a biologist at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, has for six years worked with the Center for Molecular Immunology on another vaccine to treat lung cancer called Racotumomab, with an entirely different mechanism. (It messes with a particular lipid found in tumor cell membranes.) \"Investigators from around the world are trying to crack the nut of cancer,\" Rothstein says. \"The Cubans are thinking in ways that are novel and clever.\"\n\nAlthough President Obama has used his executive power to lift some restrictions against medical and research equipment, Congress must lift the Cuban embargo before collaborative research can ramp up. Johnson hopes to see Cuba embrace more entrepreneurialism in science, and see the US soak up more creative approaches to medical research. Constrained by politics, the Cuban researchers had to innovate in ways the US and Europe did not. Now maybe they'll be able to teach their colleagues what they learned.\n\nTopics\n\ncancer\n\nmedicine\n\nvaccines\n\nWIRED is where tomorrow is realized.

Please support us!\n\nSupport Us\n\nThere are many causes of habitat destruction, including leveling land for development and deforestation resulting from the logging industry. In total, about\n\n18 million acres\n\nof forest are lost worldwide every year. This loss of habitat, along with degradation resulting from the environmental impact of pollution and climate change, is causing species to go extinct at a rate\n\n1,000 times faster\n\nthan they would if humans weren\u2019t in the picture.\n\nAnd while we certainly need to pay attention to these causes and do our part to lessen their impact on the environment, the often-overlooked threat\u00a0to animal habitats and our environment is agriculture, which is\n\ndraining our world of its biodiversity\n\nthrough habitat destruction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund\n\n, \u201caround 50 percent of the world\u2019s habitable land has been converted to farming land.\u201d \u00a0But when we think about agriculture, we need to look beyond the grasslands used for\n\ngrazing livestock\n\nand the acres of land dedicated to massive farming operations, or even the land used to grow vegetables and grains for human consumption. Why? Because\n\n33 percent of agricultural land worldwide\n\nis used\n\nsolely\n\nfor livestock feed production. And when you combine that with the amount of land used for grazing and housing animals, you\u2019ll realize that we have a huge problem.\n\nMost of Our Grain is Being Consumed by Animals, Not Humans\n\nSoapWitch/pixabay\n\nApproximately\n\n70 billion farm animals\n\nare being raised for food annually. In 2015, people in the U.S. consumed\n\n24.8 billion\n\npounds of beef, with the majority of that cattle being raised in massive feedlots. Those cattle, in addition to other feedlot animals like chickens and pigs, are consuming\n\n70 percent\n\nof the grain grown in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the USDA\u2019s\n\nwebsite\n\n, corn, barley, oats, and sorghum are used as major feed grains in the U.S., with corn \u201caccounting for more than 95 percent of total feed grain and production use.\u201d In the U.S.,\n\n36 percent\n\nof corn\u00a0crops\u00a0being used to feed livestock. Soy is also commonly used in feed, with\n\n75 percent\n\nof global soybean crops being fed to livestock. To support these crops,\n\none-third\n\nof arable land being used for feed production globally, using vast amounts of land and water resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForests Are Being Cleared at an Alarming Rate\n\nSam Beebe\n\n/flickr\n\nThe world\u2019s tropical rainforests are home to over\n\n13 million\n\nspecies \u2014 or, around two-thirds of all plants and animals. The Amazon Rainforest alone is home to more than\n\n2,000 known species\n\nof mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. It also houses\n\n40,000 known plant species\n\n, some of which play an important role in the treatment of diseases like cancer. Worldwide, forests serve as the habitat for over\n\n80 percent\n\nof the world\u2019s animals, and an estimated\n\n1.6 billion\n\npeople rely on forests for everything from food and water, to shelter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgriculture is responsible for a staggering\n\n80 percent of deforestation\n\n, causing humans and animals to lose their homes, and throwing entire ecosystems \u2014 as well as our planet \u2014 off balance. Soy production is one major culprit, destroying\n\nfour million hectares\n\nof forest in South America every year. But\n\nbefore you go blaming tofu\n\n, remember that the vast majority of soy is being used to feed livestock, not humans.\n\nPesticides and Fertilizers Are Poisoning Aquatic Habitats\n\nAqua Mechanical\n\n/flickr\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrop production also\n\nposes a serious threat\n\nto marine life and freshwater species. Since most crops are maintained using nitrogen fertilizer and herbicides, both of which contribute to the pollution of our land, these\n\npollutants are contaminating\n\nnearby lakes, rivers, and streams \u2014 and eventually, the ocean.\n\nExcessive amounts of nutrients in the water can result in\n\nalgal blooms\n\nand deplete oxygen levels in lakes and oceans, resulting in\n\ndead zones\n\nwhere fish, turtles, and other animals are unable to survive. When this happens, the animals either leave the area or die. The Gulf of Mexico has the second-largest dead zone due to the pollution that\u2019s emptied into it after being carried downstream from as far as Canada. There are currently around\n\n400 dead zones\n\nin the world\u2019s oceans. As a result, over\n\n130\n\nfederally protected species are in danger of extinction.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nWith the world\u2019s population estimated to reach\n\nover nine billion\n\npeople by 2050, we need to take a serious look at our food choices. It takes one acre of land to produce\n\n250 pounds of beef\n\n, where that same amount of land can produce 30,000 pounds of carrots or 53,000 pounds of potatoes. By\n\neating less meat\n\n, we can also help fight climate change,\n\nreduce our water footprint\n\n, reduce pollution, and prevent further habitat destruction and species extinction. It\u2019s a simple way to make a big impact for humans and the environment.\n\nYou can\n\n#EatForThePlanet\n\nstarting today. Just follow the three simple steps below.\n\n1.\u00a0Replace:\n\nTry to\n\nswap animal-based products\n\nin your daily diet with vegan alternatives (milk, butter, mayo, cheese, grilled chicken, beef crumbles, sausages, cold cuts, etc.)\n\n2.\u00a0Embrace:\n\nAdd plant-based whole foods\n\n(local and organic when possible) to your diet like greens, fresh fruits, and vegetables, whole grains, plant proteins like lentils, nuts/seeds, beans, tofu, etc.\n\n3.\u00a0Moderate\n\n: Limit consumption of your favorite meats like beef, lamb, pork, etc.\n\n\u201cThe\n\n#EatForThePlanet\n\nWay is not about restricting your diet, but about changing the way you think about your food choices,\u201d says\n\nZacharias.\n\n\u201cWhen you Eat for the Planet, you make the conscious decision to reduce your negative impact on the world around you.\u201d\n\nWe all have the power to create a better future for our children, and the countless animals we share the planet with, by making one easy swap. If you\u2019re ready to start doing this in your own life, check out\n\nOne Green Planet\u2019s #EatForThePlanet campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more Animal, Earth, Life, Vegan Food, Health, and Recipe content published daily, subscribe to the\n\nOne Green Planet Newsletter\n\n!

You mean the soy products made from soy that\\\u2019s grown in those very fields that are tilled in destroyed natural habitats?\n\nPoint me towards mass-produced vegan products that are made from plants that are NOT grown on an industrial farm.

As one of only three individuals to have their name enshrined in the PRC\u2019s constitution, Xi s arguably the most influential leader of China in decades.\n\nLife\n\nEarly Life\n\nGeneral Secretary Jinping was born in 1953 to affluent and respected parents. Xi Zhongxun, his father, was one of the Chinese Communist Party's founding members, a vice-premier, and close friend of Chairman Mao Zedong. Despite having held high positions and maintaining close working relationships with powerful officials, Zhongxun fell out of favor with Mao and was sent to work in a general stores factory in Henan.\n\nIn 1966, Xi Jinping\u2019s education was cut short when universities across the nation were forced to shutter during the Cultural Revolution. Soon thereafter, the Xi family was targeted as an enemy of the people for their father's supposed crimes. In 1967, a student militia raided the Xi home, causing irreparable in damage and destroying family heirlooms. Less than a month later, Xi Jinping\u2019s sister, Xi Heping, committed suicide after being pressured and bullied by party enforcers. Throughout all this, Xi and his mother were forced by local cadre to publicly denounce Xi Zhongxun as a traitor to the state and enemy of China.\n\nIn 1969, Xi Jinping was sent to China\u2019s desolate province of Shaanxi to work as a manual laborer. While there, he was assigned to work as the town\u2019s party secretary. Within three months, Xi grew disillusioned with the position and snuck back into Beijing. Although he was able to enjoy his freedom for a short period of time, he was arrested during a state crackdown on hard-labor deserters. As punishment for his dereliction of duty, he was sent to a work camp to dig irrigation ditches, the location of which is unknown.\n\nRise to Power\n\nIn 1971, the future leader of China was presented with an opportunity to escape his dire situation. After befriending a local strongman, Xi joined the local chapter of the Community Youth League of China (CYL). Similar to Boy Scouts in the United States of America, the CYL's mission was to prepare the PRC\u2019s next generation of leaders. Managed by the Communist Party of China, several of China's top officials would emerge from CYL program. In 1972, more fortune befell the young man when he was reunited with his father at the behest of Premier Zhou Enlai. With normalcy somewhat restored, Xi entered Tsinghua University in Beijing to study chemical engineering.\n\nIn 1974, Xi became a member of the Communist Party of China. He received his first posting in 1974 as a branch secretary, but was forced to put his advancement on hold while attending university for chemical engineering. After his graduation in 1979, Xi became a secretary for Vice Premier Geng Viao, the secretary-general of the all powerful Central Military Commission (CMC). This transformative experience not only taught Xi about the People\u2019s Liberation Army and its rampant technological, modernization, and mobilization issues, but about the intricacies of operating within the Communist Party itself.\n\nFollowing the normalization of relations between the United States and the People\u2019s Republic in 1979, Xi traveled to the United States as part of a Chinese delegation to study mass agriculture strategies. While on the trip, Xi had the opportunity to stay in the home of an American family in Muscatine, Iowa. Although discussion between the two sides were difficult (Xi and the family had to speak through a translator), the experience reportedly left a lasting impression of the United States on Xi.\n\nAlways seeking to advance his reputation and prestige within the party, Xi shrewdly resigned from CMC duty in 1982. Instead of remaining in Beijing, he requested a deputy secretary position in the province of Hebei. Although the province has many mega-cities, Hebei is also known for its jagged terrain and unforgiving weather. By vying for a more difficult position outside of Beijing instead of a comfortable party job, Xi garnered much praise and admiration from high party officials. Mr. Jinping would remain in this post until 1985, when he become the vice mayor of Xiamen, Fujian.\n\nWhile on assignment in Xiamen, Xi met Peng Liyuan, a well-known and respected Chinese folksinger. After being introduced by friends, their relationship slowly developed into a romantic one. In 1987, after obtaining the required parental consent, they married.\n\nFollowing the marriage, Xi\u2019s good fortunes continued. By 1995, he had worked his way to the post of deputy provincial party secretary, and by 1999, the governorship of Fujian. From his tenure in Fujian, we begin to see Xi\u2019s policy objectives. Top on his agenda was expanding trade with Taiwan, which lay just across the straight. Another topic commonly dealt with by the young governor was environmental conservation, and the growing pollution situation as a result of economic advancement. He held the governorship of Fujian until 2002, when he became the governor and party secretary of Zhejiang. The same year, he became a full member of the 16th Central Committee and thus a national figure, albeit a minor one. While in Zhejiang, Xi attempted to take on rampant corruption that crippled the local administration ability to govern. He also sought to improve infrastructure for the local population and promote industrial development. It remains unclear how effective these attempts were.\n\nIn 2007, the CPC turned to Mr. Jinping for a helping hand. Shanghai\u2019s party secretary had been dipping his hand into the local population\u2019s pension fund, and proved quite sloppy in covering his tracks. Xi was quickly transferred to the city and given the party secretary position for seven months. In this highly public and envied position, he effectively rooted out corruption while simultaneously following the party line.\n\nIn late 2007, Xi was rewarded for his loyalty to the party with a position on the highly respected Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), the most powerful decision making body in the CPC. This position not only fermented Mr. Jinping\u2019s position within the party, but also within China. He was now on a very short list of likely successors to be General Secretary, and also had the ability to influence high-level policy discussions. Within a year, Jinping's status was further elevated when he became the Vice President of China. While in the position, Xi took a special interest in developing trade relationships with foreign states and on improving pollution levels within the People\u2019s Republic.\n\nIn 2010, Xi went full circle and was named the Vice Chairmen of the Central Military Commission (CMC). Less than two years later, in November 2012, Xi Jinping would become the most powerful man in China. At the Communist Party's 18th Congress, Xi became the General Secretary and Chairman of the CMC, thus wielding all political and military power inside the PRC. In March of 2013, Xi became the leader of the state after being elected President of China by the National People\u2019s Congress.\n\nPolicies\n\nUpon taking the seat of power, Xi Jinping sought to transform the PRC's strategic policy objectives both at home and abroad. Specifically, his concerns were focused around corruption, economic growth, military readiness, and internal order.\n\nCorruption\n\nMr. Jinping\u2019s main objective at the start of his tenure was the professionalization of the Chinese Communist Party and state government. This was made manifest in the form of a major anti-corruption crackdown in the months following his inauguration. This campaign quickly made Xi powerful enemies, including former members of the Central Military Commission, Politburo Standing Committee, and state security agencies. However, Xi persisted. Within the first two years of the campaign alone, nearly 200,000 low-ranking officials of the CCP received warnings, fines, and demotions. An unknown amount of individuals have seen their lives upended by dismissals or forced resignations.\n\nThe anti-corruption campaign has also been used to rid the General Secretary of political rivals. Some analysts and exiles have claimed that it is simply a political purge on a scale not seen since the Cultural Revolution, with enforcers believing themselves above the law and unafraid to target innocent individuals.\n\nEconomy\n\nSince 1979, the People's Republic of China has enjoyed unprecedented levels of economic growth. For the past 40 years, China's real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annual rate of nearly 10%. Xi did not start this trend, but he certainly helped it along. By increasing the status of the renminbi (RMB), developing trade partnerships though the Belt and Road Initiative, and making it easier for banks to issue loans, Xi has developed China's middle class and industrial sector into a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, however, may change that trend. Official government numbers from April of 2020 broadcast a nearly 6.8% decline in GDP for the first quarter of the year, the first ever contraction since China started reporting quarterly GDP data in 1992. Of course, a deep contraction isn't surprising given the massive quarantine and lockdown implemented to contain the deadly virus. More concerning for the Chinese Communist Party, however, is the rate at which countries are shifting their supply chains out of China. \u200b\n\nOn April 8, 2020, the Intelligence Ledger reported that the Japanese government was seeking to move its manufactures supply chains out of the People's Republic. It allocated nearly $2.2 billion of the governments economic stimulus package to help firms move production out of China to Japan, and 23.5 trillion yen is intended to help those relocating to stronger allies of Japan. Such moves are being considered by countries as diverse as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and France.\n\nSensing this growing chill, Xi has sought to flex Chinese economic muscle in order to force these states into remaining trading partners, namely Australia. He has also called for the PRC to develop a greater self-reliance on domestic goods and services.\n\nInternal Order\n\nThe PRC controls territory roughly equivalent in size to that of the United States of America. Yet, with nearly 1.3 billion people, its population is over four times as large. Sixty percent of the population lives in only 24% of the country, and most of those live on China\u2019s expansive coast. The other 74% of China is populated by what the Chinese government calls, \u201cnational minorities.\u201d The national minorities are composed of Tibetans and Kazakhs, with Uyghurs and other muslim groups in the relatively rebellious region of Xinjiang. These minorities have strained relations with the government in Beijing, and have close ties with groups in other countries or unofficial relations with other states. \u200bChina views the preservation of order in Tibet and Xinjiang as vital to its national security.\n\nXinjiang is home to Uyghuri separatists who have engaged in acts of protest, both peaceful and violent, to promote independence. In Tibet, most of the population is loyal to the Dalai Lama, a monk who is in exile and believes in an autonomous state. He has been charged by the PRC with promoting Tibetan independence, and thus has been labeled a traitor.\u200b Most recently, the mass protests in Hong Kong have proven extremely disconcerting to the government in Beijing. The uprisings against the central government began in June 2019, when activists called attention to the central governments increasing interference in city affairs. They continued throughout the year, evolving into a movement pushing for democratic reforms within Hong Kong itself and throughout greater China.\n\nXi Jinping has squashed these movements with great efficiency. In May of 2014, the world watched in silence as Beijing used threats of terrorism as a pretext to mercilessly crackdown on members of minority communities in Xinjiang. It is believed that as many as 900,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other minorities have been sent to 're-education camps' since the start of the de facto anti-minority campaign.\n\nIn reality, these are not places of learning. Inmates are forced by the CCP and the government of the PRC to undergo relentless political indoctrination, endless torture, and repeated periods of food deprivation. Furthermore, and perhaps most hurtful to these minorities, is the denial of religious and cultural freedom. Deaths of the infirm, elderly, and outspoken are commonly reported, although the exact number of those killed remains unknown.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Xi has also shown a blatant disregard for international agreements. A British Colony and Dependent Territory of the United Kingdom until 1997, the city was handed back over to Beijing after London obtained guarantees that the city's freedoms, system, and laws would be protected until the year 2047. It is clear, however, that Mr. Jinping has not honored the terms of the pact. Since entering power, reports of judicial tampering have grown and Chinese intelligence operations more common.\n\nRecently, Xi supported the passage of a national security law that would erode Hong Kong's autonomy and bring the city under its control during the annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC). The exact structure of the statue has been shrouded in secrecy by Chinese officials. In fact, the only public statement made by the Chinese government in regards to the legislation was by Stanley Ng, head of the NPC, who declared the law outlaws secession, attempts to subvert state power, foreign interference in city affairs, and terrorism. In the view of the CCP and Chinese government, tighter control over Hong Kong is necessary to preserve domestic order and to protect the state from hostile external forces.\n\nWhile details regarding the new law are hard to come by, one can begin to piece together what it may look like from previous attempts by Beijing to curb opposition in the city. Censorship of the press, searches without warrants, and the destruction of the city's free and independent judiciary are undoubtedly included. Furthermore, Chinese law requires any company operating within China must do their most to help the security state. In 2014, China instituted the Counter-Espionage Law, which states, \"when the state security organ investigates and understands the situation of espionage and collects relevant evidence, the relevant organizations and individuals shall provide it truthfully and may not refuse.\"\n\nThe 2017 National Intelligence Law went further, requiring, \"any organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law.\" Such forced cooperation would quickly erode the city's preeminent position as the home for western businesses in China.\n\nMost importantly, the law empowers Beijing to legally bring the hammer down on Hong Kong's protestors who have been directly challenging the CCP's leadership.\n\nXi Jinping has also sought to use censorship in his quest to ensure internal order. In July of 2012, the CCP released\n\nDocument No. 9.\n\nThe internal memo warns of seven dangerous values: constitutional democracy, pro-market neoliberalism, independent media, individual rights, universal values, historical nihilism, and criticism of socialism. The release or publication of information that deals with these topics is banned in stores, social media, television, and radio.\n\nMilitary\n\nSince taking power in 2012, Xi has overseen a massive modernization and reorganization of the People's Liberation Army.

His father was Xi Zhongxun, one of the Chinese Communist Party's founding members, a vice-premier, and close friend of \u200bChairman Mao. In 1962, however, his family was among the victims impacted by the Cultural Revolution. Xi's father was imprisoned for crimes against the state, while the nine year old boy was sent to the countryside for \"re-education.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nThis did not turn Mr. Xi against the CPC. Instead, he worked his way to the top of the organization. Today, he is President of the People's Republic of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. He is one of only three individuals to have their name enshrined in the PRC's constitution, and is arguably the most influential leader of the state in decades.\n\nSo, is he simply a man who made the best of a bad situation, or an evil that must be stopped?

A federal investigation into Hunter is ongoing, and Republicans vow to continue to probe how Hunter profited off his father\u2019s name, and what President-elect Biden knew about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to turn a blind eye on this,\u201d Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.)\n\nsaid last week\n\n. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep digging.\u201d\n\nBased on information from the laptop and interviews, here\u2019s what we know about the Chinese deal:\n\nJune 2009\n\nAs the Obama-Biden administration hit the halfway point of its inaugural year, Hunter Biden co-founded Rosemont Seneca Partners, an investment fund, along with Christopher Heinz \u2014 the stepson of Obama\u2019s future Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 and Devon Archer, a former Kerry adviser.\n\nApril 7-9, 2010\n\nHunter Biden visited China as a Rosemont Seneca rep during the second year of his father\u2019s vice presidency. There he gained audiences with top officials of influential state-linked enterprises including the Postal Savings Bank, China Investment Corp., and Founder Group. He was joined on the trip by James Bulger, the politically connected co-founder of the Thornton Group, an Asia-oriented financial services firm.\n\n2012\n\nAs Joe Biden ran for his second term as vice president, Hunter Biden and Devon Archer made contact with Chinese financier Jonathan Li, who ran the private-equity fund Bohai Capital. The trio discussed a plan to become partners in a new operation that would invest Chinese cash in ventures outside the country. Eighty percent of the resulting company, Bohai Harvest, was controlled by Chinese state-owned interests.\n\nDecember 2013\n\nWhen Chinese president Xi Jinping\n\nalarmed the rest of Asia\n\nwith an aggressive expansion of his military claims over the East China Sea, Vice President Biden was\n\ndispatched to Beijing\n\nto try to de-escalate tensions. The second son tagged along on Air Force Two. While a somber and subdued Joe Biden held a marathon five-hour meeting with Xi, Hunter got together with Jonathan Li in what handlers at the time described as a social visit. The son even arranged for a handshake between Li and his father at the hotel of the American delegation \u2014 troubling some of the vice president\u2019s advisors,\n\naccording to the New Yorker.\n\nTen days later, the\u00a0Chinese business license for Bohai Harvest \u2014 the company that Hunter Biden and Devon Archer had been trying to launch for more than a year \u2014 was approved.\n\nYe Jianming\n\n2015\n\nAround this time Hunter Biden\u2019s relationship to Chinese tycoon Ye Jianming \u201cbegan to ramp up,\u201d\n\naccording to a Senate report\n\nreleased in September. Ye, the founder of Chinese energy giant CEFC, served as the nation\u2019s unofficial energy liaison to Russia.\n\nFeb. 23 and March 1, 2017\n\nA month after Biden left office, a total of $6 million in wire transfers were made from State Energy HK Ltd., a company controlled by Ye, to Robinson Walker LLC. That company was controlled by Rob Walker, a longtime business partner of Hunter\u2019s who had collaborated with him in at least three other companies. Walker\n\nserved in both\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s administrations \u2014 and his wife, Betsy Massey Walker, is\n\nreportedly\n\na former member of future First Lady\u2019s Jill Biden\u2019s personal staff. The Senate\u2019s joint Finance Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report said it was \u201cunclear what the true purpose is behind these transactions and who the ultimate beneficiary is.\u201d\n\nMay 2-3, 2017\n\nVenture capitalist Tony Bobulinski was\n\nrecruited by the Bidens\n\naround this time to serve as CEO of Sinohawk Holdings, which he describes as a partnership between Ye\u2019s CEFC and the Biden family. Bobulinski\n\nmet  twice with Joe Biden\n\nat the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, where the former veep was set to give a speech. Hunter, Bobulinski told The Post, \u201cbrings Joe over and introduces me, saying [Joe\u2019s] the one who\u2019s helping us with the business we\u2019re doing with the Chinese.\u201d  Biden responded, \u201cI trust you. Good luck and work hard\u201d \u2014 and added a second instruction the next morning: \u201cKeep an eye on my son and [brother Jim Biden] and look out for my family.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden has repeatedly denied any knowledge of his son\u2019s business operation. In September 2020 he\n\ntold reporters emphatically\n\n, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d\n\nTony Bobulinski\n\nREUTERS/Tom Brenner\n\nMay 11, 2017\n\nJames Gilliar, another Hunter Biden business associate, talked with Bobulinski about\n\nhow to \u201cget Joe involved\u201d\n\nin a joint venture with CEFC. The two discussed ways to make the effort look like a \u201ctruly family business\u201d in a series of text messages seen by The Post. \u201cLet\u2019s get the company set up, then tell H and family the high stakes and get Joe involved,\u201d Gilliar wrote. The texts were contained in a tranche of emails and documents released by Bobulinski.\n\nMay 13, 2017\n\nGilliar\n\nemailed Hunter Biden\n\nto outline remuneration packages for Hunter and five other people in an unspecified business venture. The email \u2014 found on the Hunter Biden laptop and exposed in a bombshell report by The Post \u2014 suggested equity shares were being assigned to Biden family members, with a note indicating that 10% would be held by Hunter \u201cfor the big guy\u201d \u2014 who Bobulinski later definitively identified as Joe Biden. Three days later, Bobulinski says, the plans changed: Joe Biden\u2019s 10% share would be held in the name of his brother Jim instead.\n\nBobulinski voiced his doubts about the wisdom of Joe Biden\u2019s involvement to Jim Biden, in light of his brother\u2019s political stature.\n\n\u201cI remember saying, \u2018How are you guys getting away with this? Aren\u2019t you concerned?\u2019\u201d Bobulinski\n\nsaid in an interview\n\nwith The Post\u2019s Michael Goodwin.\n\n\u201c\u2018Plausible deniability,'\u201d Jim Biden responded with a chuckle, Bobulinski recalled.\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention Joe being involved, it\u2019s only when u are face to face, I know u know that but they are paranoid,\u201d Gilliar\n\ninstructed Bobulinksi\n\nin an encrypted WhatsApp message thread. In response, Bobulinksi wrote, \u201cOK they should be paranoid about things.\u201d Later, Bobulinski added what seemed to be a warning about Joe Biden\u2019s future political plans: \u201cYou need to stress to H, does he want to be the reason or factor that blows up his dad\u2019s campaign.\u201d The former veep was still two years away from announcing his third White House bid.\n\nJune 18, 2017\n\nHunter Biden\n\nmade an urgent request\n\nto Ye Jianming to wire him $10 million as seed money for a new venture, SinoHawk Holdings, according to an email obtained by The Post. In the missive he said he was extending \u201cbest wishes from the entire Biden family\u201d and that \u201cWe are all hoping to see you here again soon, or in Shanghai.\u201d\n\nThe diamond sent to Hunter Biden by Ye Jianming.\n\nSummer 2017\n\nHunter met with Ye in Miami to solicit donations for World Food Program USA, according to the Senate report. Over dinner, they discussed details of helping the Chinese magnate find investments for CEFC in the United States. Afterward, Ye sent him a 2.8-carat diamond as a thank-you gift. \u201cI just felt like it was weird,\u201d Hunter later\n\ntold The New Yorker\n\n\u2014 but he accepted the gem. The rock later become a bone of contention in\n\ndivorce proceedings\n\nbetween Hunter Biden and first wife Kathleen Buhle.\n\nAug 1, 2017\n\nA hand-drawn flow chart included in the Senate report\n\nshows an ownership breakdown\n\nof an entity called \u201cHudson West\u201d with a 50/50 split between Biden and someone identified only as \u201cchairman.\u201d An email sent the next day strongly suggests the \u201cchairman\u201d in question was Ye Jianming \u2014 and notes that while Hunter was to have earned $10 million a year \u201cfor introductions alone,\u201d those earlier terms had been changed \u201cTO A MUCH MORE LASTING AND LUCRATIVE ARRANGEMENT.\u201d\n\nAug. 8, 2017\n\nYe\u2019s CEFC wired $5 million to Hudson West. That same day, the company began a year-long series of payments to Owasco, Hunter Biden\u2019s law firm, that would total $4.79 million, the Senate report found. Owasco subsequently sent $1.4 million \u2014 parceled out in 20  different wire transfers \u2014 to the Lion Hall Group, a consulting firm controlled by James Biden and his wife, Sara Biden.\n\nSept. 21, 2017\n\nHunter Biden emailed the Washington office building House of Sweden to\n\nrequest a set of keys\n\nfor Rosemont Seneca offices be produced for Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden and Gongwen Dong \u2014 all of whom were described as \u201coffice mates,\u201d according to another email. Hunter Biden also noted that Gongwen Dong was an \u201cemissary\u201d for CEFC and Ye.\n\nThe House of Sweden building.\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nChi Ping Patrick Ho, a Ye lieutenant,\n\nagreed to pay Hunter Biden\n\na $1 million retainer for \u201cCounsel to matters related to US law and advice pertaining to the hiring and legal analysis of any US Law Firm or Lawyer,\u201d according to an attorney engagement letter obtained by The Post.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nA Manhattan federal jury convicted Ho for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by trying to bribe government officials in Africa. He was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\n2018\n\nThe Department of Justice opens a probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s tax affairs, business ties in China and the Ukraine and documents covering his involvement in more than two dozen entities, according to a\n\nDec. 13, 2020 report by the Associated Press.\n\nAt least one 2017 email notes Hunter Biden failed to disclose $400,000 in income he earned while on the board of the Ukrainian Energy company Burisma.\n\n2018\n\nYe Jianming vanishes in China amid suspicions of \u201ceconomic crimes.\u201d\n\nApril 12, 2019\n\nHunter Biden\n\nleft a waterlogged laptop\n\nat a Delaware computer repair store owned by John Paul Mac Isaac seeking repairs. The computer bore a sticker for the Beau Biden Foundation, named for his deceased brother. Hunter Biden never returned for the machine, however, and Mac Isaac said after repeated attempts to contact Hunter failed, he legally took possession of it under terms of the repair contract.\n\nThe Mac Shop in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nPhoto by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nJohn Paul Mac Isaac, the owner of The Mac Shop.\n\nYouTube\n\nAd\n\nUp Next\n\nClose\n\nBig trouble in little Monaco: Paternity suit, shaved head rock royal watchers\n\nThis week, royal watchers around the world were scratching their...\n\n2\n\nView Slideshow\n\nBack\n\nContinue\n\nShare this:\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nCopy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecember 19, 2020\n\nApril 25, 2019\n\nJoe Biden announced he\u2019s running for president.\n\nDec. 9, 2019\n\nThe FBI issued a subpoena for the Hunter Biden laptop after they are informed of its existence by Mac Isaac, who was \u201cconcerned\u201d about what he saw on its hard drive. \u201cI just don\u2019t know \u2026 what I\u2019m allowed to say,\u201d Isaac\n\nexplained months later\n\n. \u201cI know that I saw, I saw stuff.

Designed to reduce wind noise when recording outdoors, the DeadCat VMP+ combines an open-cell foam surround with an outer layer of acoustically transparent artificial fur. A rubber base prevents any wind noise from entering the rear of the microphone pickup area, whilst ensuring a secure fit specifically suited to the VMP+ Microphone. The DeadCat VMP+ is only compatible with the VideoMic Pro+. For other VideoMic Pro models please see the DeadCat VMP and DeadCat VMPR.\n\n#productDescription h3 {\nmargin: 0.75em 0px 0.375em -1px;\n}\n\nFrom the manufacturer\n\nProtect your recordings from wind noise with a Deadcat.\n\nChoose the appropriate R\u00d8DE Deadcat for your microphone, and enjoy shooting outdoors with improved wind-noise protection.\n\nRead more\n\nDo I need a Deadcat?\n\nIf you plan to shoot outdoors, we strongly recommend using a Deadcat. With the appropriate Deadcat, fitted correctly, you can rest assured that your recordings are well protected against wind noise which would render footage unusable without it. Additionally, Deadcats can help protect against plosive sounds if using your VideoMic as a voice-over recording microphone. We at R\u00d8DE are animal lovers, so our Deadcats are produced using entirely artificial fur.\n\nDiscover the correct Deadcat for your microphone with our handy table below.\n\nRead more\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                              |                |                   |                                      |                                |                     |                            | \n|                              |  VideoMic User |  VideoMic GO User |                    VideoMic Pro User |  VideoMic Pro with Rycote User |  VideoMic Pro+ User |   Stereo VideoMic Pro User | \n| Which Microphone Do You Own? | R\u00d8DE VideoMic | R\u00d8DE VideoMic GO | R\u00d8DE VideoMic Pro (w/Elastic Bands) | R\u00d8DE VideoMic Pro with Rycote | R\u00d8DE VideoMic Pro+ | R\u00d8DE Stereo VideoMic Pro+ | \n|                    You Need: |        Deadcat |        Deadcat GO |                          Deadcat VMP |                   Deadcat VMPR |        Deadcat VMP+ |                 DeadKitten | \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomer Questions & Answers\n\nSee questions and answers\n\nCustomer reviews\n\n4.7 out of 5 stars\n\n4.7 out of 5\n\n266 global ratings\n\n------------------------------------------------\n|                              5 star |  | 82% | \n|                              4 star |  | 13% | \n|                              3 star |  |  4% | \n| 2 star                      0% (0%) |  |  0% | \n|                              1 star |  |  1% | \n------------------------------------------------\n\nHow are ratings calculated?\n\nTo calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don\u2019t use a simple average.

I bought it as an opened-box \u2018as new\u2019 item from Amazon Warehouse deals. Initially I was a bit dubious about this but backed by Amazon\u2019s 30 days money-back guarantee I took the plunge to give it a go. Actually it turned out to be all right, not quite sure why the previous buyer returned it. But anyway back to the machine itself. This was Sony\u2019s flagship prosumer camcorder until the 2nd half of 2017 when they released the upgraded version of 700E, which in my opinion isn\u2019t really worth the price tag considering the extra premium you pay.\n\nPros:\n\nTrue 4k imagine capturing, when footage played back on UHD TV the quality is mind blowing.\n\nFairly good image stabiliser, if not mistaken it\u2019s optical.\n\nThe supplied battery delivers usable time in real world.\n\nDual format allows you to record the main 4k footage and a 720p mp4 reference file simultaneously.\n\nAnd I agree with all other good points mentioned by other reviewers on Amazon UK.\n\nCons: from my own experience after 8 months use.\n\nSlow auto focusing, the machine struggles a bit to hunt the correct focus in low light and sometimes even in bright situations. You may wish to quickly switch to manual focus to save time.\n\nThe menu system is clunky yet confusing in some aspects.\n\nOnly stereo sound capturing in 4k recording modes.\n\nThe machine is noticeably slower in 4k recording modes than it is in full HD or lower-res modes.\n\nEuropean/PAL model i.e. AX 100E can record either 24p or 25p in 4k, which in my opinion isn\u2019t fast enough for fast panning shots or actions. So expect \u2018jitter\u2019 on playback especially on big screens. Someone may like this \u2018film look\u2019 though, while others may not. (NB. The upgraded 700E has the same frame rate on paper).\n\nThe recent stock of this camcorder should be shipped with the latest firmware which has improved auto-focusing algorithm and 100Mbps 4k recording mode. So it\u2019s worth checking that first, if not then you can easily download and install the latest firmware from Sony website. Full instructions are provided there.\n\nRead more\n\n13 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nMr. A. PICKUP\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nAbsolutely delighted!\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 September 2020\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI use a Fuji system, but bought this for videos - the Fuji ones are OK, iPhone OK, that's all. I got this yesterday, so tried it out today and, reluctant as I was, left my 'proper' still equipment at home..\n\n1) I had only read a little of the manual, but coped well enough without. Couldn't change aperture so that is the first thing to look up.\n\n2) I didn't expect to take any stills, but I needed one of a new building which is being developed (I run a local website). The photos are excellent, though I wish it did RAW or DNG. Good enough, though. I took dozens of still photos, mostly of the ground, as my finger kept hitting the button! It takes a few seconds to save them, too. 20Mp is only available with 4K video enabled.\n\n3) The video is fantastic, both 4K and the one below. What was most impressive, though, was the sound quality. I am a heavy breather (don't ask!), but it didn't pick up the sound at all, unlike my other cameras. I also heard conversations I didn't even know had taken place!\n\n4) Autofocus is slow, but when it has got it, it maintains it as it follows the subject movement.\n\n5) I wish I had taken a monopod.\n\nSo, I pondered about buying this, but after a couple of hours' use I have no regrets at all. It will be even better when i've learned to use it properly.\n\nRead more\n\nOne person found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nMr. Gordon Joslin\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nAn Image quality Video Camera.\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 June 2019\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nAn excellent video camera producing quality results in a \" Landscape\" Format. Digital skill is required to make manual adjustments and changing setting. A  theme needs planning and settings set before recording and not during shooting as self inflicted video faults can  occur. Digital stills are excellent and suitable for large format printing.\n\nDynamic range is very good but thought needs to be given to lighting conditions of the subject to ensure there are no hot spots where highlights could be burned out. Details in highlights excellent when care in composition is taken.\n\nI would like to have a  Portait format  available for I enjoy shooting Portraits. Play memories software excellent.\n\nAs the end image  and composition is usually very good, I have little need for editing.\n\nCheck the Composition. Avoid Highlights and if Manual get the settings right before recording.\n\nI prefer a Sony Video Camera and taking Stills to a Still camera taking Video. For me video compsoition and quality is no the same.\n\nRead more\n\nOne person found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nGary\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nClarity of image manual controls and well made so baught this and other than not having time lapse built in its very nice.

When played back one frame at a time one frame is perfect the next frame is brighter and looks over exposed; tree branches look thinner. Next frame normal again. The flashing effect last for about 1-2 seconds\n\nAlso excessive flickering on high detail areas such as foliage, usually when there is slight movement.\n\nOtherwise the picture quality is stunning.\n\nRead more\n\n9 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nMr. james Greene\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nFive Stars\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2015\n\nVerified

Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon.

The thunderbolt connection is a fantastic and to have a partition for sharing with PC's and also the USB3 cable for alternative connection is superb. It will be used as a working drive and not mainly for storage. Regular hard drives will be used for storing finished projects. I just hope that the integrated thunderbolt lead will stand up to regular connecting and disconnecting as I jump between MiniMac and MacAir.\n\nRead more\n\n6 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nWeatherguesser\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nHas completely rejuvenated my mid-2011 iMac - it's like having a new computer\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2017\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nThis device has completely rejuvenated my mid-2011 iMac. Having installed the operating system onto the SSD, the iMac boots in about 40 seconds, compared to about 4 minutes when it was running off the internal hard drive. It's like having a new computer, and the applications open almost instantaneously too. The spinning beachball, indicating a hanging program, is now a thing of the past. I cannot recommend this SSD enough for this reason.  (But it must be pointed out that it won't do the same for every machine - only if the computer has a Thunderbolt connection.)\n\nFor anyone wanting to do the same as me, I recommend the Twelve South BackPack for iMac (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00C1C1WU2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4), which, though rather expensive, provides a very neat solution for stowing the SSD. I use my iMac as a TV quite a lot, and need to spin it round by 45 degrees or so, and with the shelf, the SSD goes too.\n\nRead more\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nMos Daft\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nExcellent\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2020\n\nStyle Name: USB 3.0\n\nCapacity: 500 GB\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nExcellent drive.

It is refusing to show up when connected to my laptop (Mac). It is compatible with it, and has shown up before. It is impossible and unreliable to work with. Out of all the times I have connected it, it has shown up 20% of the time.\n\nThe LaCie support around it has been non-existent. Online if you google the problem a million other people have found the same thing, but with no clear resolution.

Very good!\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2017\n\nStyle Name: Scanner\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nVery good for me - I use it mainly for listening to ATC.  I live in north London and have it hooked up to an external Swedish-made professional airband rx/tx antenna and have no problems receiving LHR, LGW, STN airports, including ground traffic.\n\nBeing able to add tags to the frequencies is so useful but is a bit of a palaver doing it on the scanner - much better to use programming software on your pc - the scanner has the older USB mini type B socket for connection using an appropriate cable.  There's not much of a choice of software to do this, and you'll probably come across BuTel software, which is fine, if a little expensive - around \u20ac30 last time I looked.  Whatever you do, do NOT try and get the software for free by using TrialPay - IT'S A SCAM!!  I know as I got caught!\n\nApart from airband I've only taken the scanner out to my local shopping centre to try the Close Call feature to identify local transmissions.  It worked well, and in addition to picking-up security etc, it also picked up the local buses!\n\nThe scanner is solidly built and has so many customisable options that it will take you a while to learn what it can do. Uniden provide a (~70 pages) printed manual in English, which is nice, not to say unusual these days, but if you prefer you can also download it as a PDF.\n\nThe antenna connector is a BNC and there are many third party antennae available for it.\n\nSound quality is good and clear for my purposes and having just tried it at max is more than adequate, but distorts a little, but I guess that's to be expected with a small speaker.\n\nI had a Uniden Bearcat UBC 100XL in the 1980s for airband reception and loved it.  I worked at an airport then and occasionally took it into work with me, especially when on nightshifts, so that when I was out on the apron I could track my inbounds.  It was brilliant which is why I chose Uniden again.\n\nI'm not sure the batter life on this is that great - it comes with a set of 2300mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries which are charged via the USB socket, but there's no auto-sensor circuitry to stop when the batteries are charged.  Instead you have to set a charging time via the options, which is a bit cr*p in my opinion.  As I use the scanner at home I simply removed the batteries and have it connected via the USB cable to my pc, which works well.\n\nSquelch is via the menu system - there's no knob, and the single knob on top is multi-function.  Turn it and it changes channel/frequency, push it down first and it controls the volume.  It functions differently depending on the mode you are in, and it clicks as it turns, which is nice, although to be honest the click feels a little lightweight, plasticky\u2026or cheap.\n\nThe rubber buttons however have a nice action to them and a positive click when pressed.  You can have a beep too when they are pressed, and this can be turned off in the options.\n\nAnyway, this wasn't meant to be an in-depth review as I haven't used it that much, but sometimes when I start typing I can't stop!\n\nBut for my purposes it fits the bill very well indeed.\n\nI hope this has been of some use to someone :-)\n\nRead more\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nGood.

I'm really glad I splashed out and didn't go for anything else.\n\nIt has inbuilt banks to search through for civil aviation, CB radio, Marine etc, but a simple google search will allow you to pick out some local frequencies for your areas that you want to hear.  Programming these in (see below) lets you go into scan mode, just looking through a set number of frequencies of your choice.  After 5 minutes of listening to your local cab company you'll soon want to drop it.\n\nThe banks are  really useful when scanning.  It allows you to set things up into logical groups to include or exclude areas or choices.  I have mine setup 1) Local airport frequencies 2) ISS (yes you can listen to the Space Station as it goes over 3) Air shows, red arrows, BBMF etc and others for airports, High altitude routes, and military frequencies used alot locally.  You can temporarily lock out a frequency (get the unit to ignore it) at the press of a button until you next power up.\n\nBattery life is great, with power supplied by 2x rechargeable AA's, so easy to carry a few spares if you need them.  However this'll go all day for me at an air show or just listening in to the local airport.\n\nTo get started, I'd recommend downloading a copy of the excellent and independently written  \"Scan 125 program\".  This will allow you to manually enter all of your frequencies into relevant banks on mass via PC connected over USB cable.  This will also allow you to name your channels, something pretty impossible directly on the handset.\n\nReception for me is great with the included aerial but there are simple low price upgrades available.  Perfect performance from our loft conversion around 4 miles from Bournemouth airport, and the same in the garden too.\n\nThe 125 comes with a headphone jack so if you are out and about and want to be a little more discrete about what is, lets be honest,  quite a geeky hobby, you can plug in your badass Beats cans and enjoy great audio quality.\n\nIf you are thinking about dabbling, I can't recommend this enough.  Listening to the red arrows for the first time is both amusing and a great insight into how physical and intricate their performances are.\n\nRead more\n\n92 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nSTP\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nLiked it so much I bought a 2nd\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2018\n\nStyle Name: Scanner\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI\u2019ve owned many scanners down the years. Most considered to be high end. After a gap I decided to re-enter the hobby and after some research bought the 125xlt. That was 2 years ago.

The use of an AA (aspherical) lens not only keeps depiction faithful \u2014 it also keeps the lens unit compact. ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lens helps to ensure accurate reproduction of colour. Multilayer ZEISS T Coating further enhances image quality by reducing unwanted reflection, such as ghost and flare. | Balanced optical steadyshot (not supported in 4K)                    Image stabilisation suppresses camera shake to stabilise a movie as it is being shot within the wide-angle-to-telephoto zoom range. In HD shooting mode, it further reduces effects of camera shake even under unstable conditions with 5-axis Intelligent Active mode compensating for vibration in five different directions, so you can shoot stable high-quality movies even while running. | Fast Intelligent Autofocus (AF)                    Fast Intelligent AF achieves very speedy, accurate contrast-detection autofocus by minimising lens motion, predicting the AF range and accelerating lens drive, thereby improving response so you can capture more fleeting moments. | \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead more\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n| High-quality sound recording                    Its structural design enables the microphone to gather, from five directions, clear sound with approximately 40 per cent 15 less noise and twice as effective15 2 ch stereo (for XAVC S shooting) and three times as effective15 5.1 ch surround (for AVCHD shooting) sound performance. This makes it possible to faithfully reproduce audio with clearly defined separation. | 4 K Time-lapse capture                    You can capture 4 K size still images continuously over an extensive duration of time at a selected constant interval from each shot to the next, edit the entire sequence of still images in post-production and enjoy playback of that series of images as a time-lapse movie. | More professional-style functions                    Time Code and User Bit can be added to movies as data elements. Time Code function records hours/minutes/ seconds/frames on image data for precise video editing. User Bit function records information such as date/time/scene number, etc in eight-digit arbitrary numbers and is useful for editing movies using two or more cameras. |

According to Amazon this is \u2018beyond the expected life of the product\u2019. Amazon fail to recognise UK consumer rights law and fob me off with advice to contact Sony about the faulty product. If 33 months is \u2018beyond the expected life\u2019 for a \u00a3750 consumer camcorder then it is an absolute waste of money and not fit for purpose. You decide whether to waste your money or not!\n\nRead more\n\n19 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nPeter North\n\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n\nThis is a little annoying but as I'm not using the camera for professional ...\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2017\n\nStyle Name: Camcorder\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nThe only negative about this camera is it's only really got semi auto control (priority shooting) so you cant set all the components of exposure manually. This is locked in software to obviously make you spend an extra \u00a31,000 on the AX100 or the new AX700. This is a little annoying but as I'm not using the camera for professional shooting or paid work i can deal with this. The auto settings do a good job and I tend to use the camera on the move so manual exposure tweaking often isn't practical.\n\nOther than that the picture quality is clear, noise is low even at higher gain settings and the stabiliser is second to none. You also get 3.5mm mic input (which I use for a rode videomicro), headphone jack and evf. I love the ability to setup manual focus using the front focus ring. I use manaul focus with the focus peaking turned on more than I thought I would. Not because the auto focus is bad but because the ring is so easy and lets you fix a focus point quickly. Used to it's full potential this camera can create great quality video.\n\nRead more\n\n23 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nMacBraveheart\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars\n\nNot my cuppa at all-  may be great for those who like feeling sea-sick (5 axis balance is waaay too \"loose\")\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2018\n\nStyle Name: Camcorder\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nOMG...  I am a video editor and a fairly decent camera operative and this camera treats me like a total idiot which zero idea of where I like to stop a pan to.  Meaning-  the 5 axis balance is insane!  I am sure its great where you are jogging to keep up with your subject but when you have a steady hand as I do, deliberately stop somewhere on a hand-held pan and the confounded thing keeps rocking as though your decisions are not good enough?!  No-  I wasn't going too fast.  Yes-  it went back.  Saved myself nearly \u00a3160 and got an equivalent Panasonic.\n\nOtherwise-  nicely weighted in the hand (I am used to the Panasonic HVX200 but also had an old, much smaller, Sony camcorder for discreet work) for my liking.\n\nBuild quality was OK with enough metal to make me think it wasn't just a toy.  Inconvenient that it doesn't come with a mains lead and a battery charger.  Battery life is never going to be adequate for me and I like the ability to plug into the mains if a shoot runs over or, at VERY least, charge the (second) battery.\n\nWriting of metal...  The other thing which got to me is that when I received it the lens cover was open and the outer ring's edge is very sharp metal and had \"shaved\" the stupid non-woven packaging.  And, with the lens exposed, that allowed the lens to be covered in shavings.  I'd have had to have cleaned the lens before I could have used it, if I had kept it.\n\nRead more\n\n15 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nChristopher H.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nThe only thing I would recommend is a large memory card (there isn't one included)\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2017\n\nStyle Name: Camcorder\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nThis is a very full featured camera considering the size - which doesn't sit much above your average \"family vacation camcorder\" size (providing you're not a time traveller from the 90s).\n\nThe features and operation are immediately apparent to anyone who has operated a handicam, and most people will be able to get up and filming in no time. However, it's where you start to dive into the features of the camera that you find yourself pleasantly surprised. The wheel at the front can be used to tweak any number of things - such as focal range (magnifier included) AE balance and contrast. This, combined with a quality zoom, really helps give you control over the look of your shots. The steadicam gyroscope is also extremely handy when trying to capture a moving shot without rigid dolly or tripod stiffness.\n\nThe only thing I would recommend is a large memory card (there isn't one included). The video files easily creep into the GB range!\n\nRead more\n\n10 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nG N thompson\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nPleased with my purchase\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2018\n\nStyle Name: Camcorder\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI have been using the ax53 for sometme now, I find it simple to use and with the best quality video I have seen, it is well made and has the feel of a professional camera, I strongly advise using nd filters with the camera for perfect video, the steady shot is fantastic and the zoom gives good quality even at full zoom, you can set your own settings and use this in full manual with Manual focus or exposure, but in full auto mode the results are pretty much faultless, I use manual shutter speed with nd filter or polariser, pop it into sunny on w/b and that\u2019s about it, the results are amazing, the microphone is very good but you can always use a shotgun mic or other with the mic input on the camcorder, it\u2019s an all round perfect camcorder that can be used by anyone, also by the professional.\n\nRead more\n\n3 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nDaniel Davinci\n\nTOP 500 REVIEWER\n\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat but DARK Stills in full light\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2019\n\nStyle Name: Camcorder\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nThis camcorder is a great build.  it really feels like quality.  The LED is bright and vibrant and the res is enough to do its job.  I wasn't sure I like the 'wobble' inside due to the stabilizer but this is something I've gotten used to.  I was very impressed by the quality of the 4K videos which I took on the beach.  Previous to that, I had only taken videos indoors to good effect.\n\nIt brightens up dark videos quite nicely, however when it comes to still photographs, even with full direct studio lighting with LED's, the result is a dull image!  I can't seem to figure this out so appreciate any advice.  I can't see any option to fix this in the menu.  I always have to edit the photo on the computer.\n\nOtherwise, recommended!\n\nRead more\n\n2 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nSee all reviews\n\nvar isAUI = typeof P === 'object' && typeof P.when === 'function';\n  if(typeof setCSMReq == 'function') {\n        setCSMReq('cf');\n  }else {\n     if(typeof uet == 'function') {\n        uet('cf');\n     }\n     if(isAUI){\n     \t   P.trigger(\"cf\");\n     \t}else{\n     \t\tamznJQ.completedStage('amznJQ.criticalFeature');\n     \t}\n  }\n\nvar isAUI = typeof P === 'object' && typeof P.when === 'function';\n  if(typeof setCSMReq == 'function') {\n        setCSMReq('cf');\n  }else {\n     if(typeof uet == 'function') {\n        uet('cf');\n     }\n     if(isAUI){\n     \t   P.trigger(\"cf\");\n     \t}else{\n     \t\tamznJQ.completedStage('amznJQ.criticalFeature');\n     \t}\n  }\n\n{\"pageRefreshUrlParams\":{\"sid\":\"262-9425765-6175839\",\"ptd\":\"CAMCORDER\",\"json\":\"1\",\"dpxAjaxFlag\":\"1\",\"sCac\":\"1\",\"isUDPFlag\":\"1\",\"twisterView\":\"glance\",\"ee\":\"2\",\"pgid\":\"ce_display_on_website\",\"tagActionCode\":\"rvaportal-21\",\"rid\":\"FN4ZJVW07V19SM6PTZ0B\",\"parentAsin\":\"B01K49H6ZS\",\"enPre\":\"1\",\"dcm\":\"1\",\"asinList\":\"B01B5TEX2K\",\"numericGLProductGroupID\":\"23\",\"udpWeblabState\":\"T2\",\"storeID\":\"photo\",\"auiAjax\":\"1\"}}\n\nPages with related products.\n\nSee and discover other items:\n\nslow motion camera\n\n,\n\nsony camcorders\n\n,\n\ntime lapse camera\n\n,\n\n4k movies ultra hd\n\n,\n\n4k uhd movies\n\n,\n\n4k video camera\n\nvar ocInitTimestamp = 1620412464;\n\n----\n|  | \n----\n\n{\"rhfHandlerParams\":{\"disableRhfWeblab\":\"\",\"search\":\"\",\"rhfAsins\":\"\",\"noP13NCache\":\"\",\"weblabTriggers\":\"\",\"auiDebug\":\"\",\"keywords\":\"\",\"k\":\"\",\"rviAsins\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"parentSession\":\"262-9425765-6175839\",\"rhfState\":\"\",\"contextMetadataOverride\":\"\",\"currentSubPageType\":null,\"field-keywords\":\"\",\"relatedRequestId\":\"FN4ZJVW07V19SM6PTZ0B\",\"recsAsins\":\"\",\"rhfHorizonteWeblab\":\"\",\"excludeASIN\":\"QjAxQjVURVgySw==\",\"auditEnabled\":\"\",\"customerId\":\"\",\"testRecsFailure\":\"\",\"previewCampaigns\":\"\",\"forceWidgets\":\"\",\"currentPageType\":\"Detail\",\"stringDebug\":\"\"},\"subPageType\":null,\"requestId\":\"FN4ZJVW07V19SM6PTZ0B\",\"sessionId\":\"262-9425765-6175839\",\"customerId\":\"\",\"pageType\":\"Detail\",\"ybhHandlerParams\":{\"relatedRequestId\":\"FN4ZJVW07V19SM6PTZ0B\",\"currentPageType\":\"Detail\",\"parentSession\":\"262-9425765-6175839\"}}\n\nYour recently viewed items and featured recommendations\n\n\u203a\n\nView or edit your browsing history\n\nAfter viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.\n\nYour recently viewed items and featured recommendations\n\n\u203a\n\nView or edit your browsing history\n\nAfter viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.\n\nBack to top\n\nGet to Know Us\n\nCareers\n\nAbout Us\n\nUK Modern Slavery Statement\n\nSustainability\n\nMake Money with Us\n\nSell on Amazon\n\nSell Under Private Brands\n\nSell on Amazon Business\n\nSell on Amazon Handmade\n\nSell on Amazon Launchpad\n\nAssociates Programme\n\nFulfilment by Amazon\n\nSeller Fulfilled Prime\n\nAdvertise Your Products\n\nIndependently Publish with Us\n\nAmazon Pay\n\nHost an Amazon Hub\n\n\u203a\n\nSee all\n\nAmazon Payment Methods\n\nAmazon Platinum Mastercard\n\nAmazon Classic Mastercard\n\nAmazon Money Store\n\nGift Cards\n\nAmazon Currency Converter\n\nPayment Methods Help\n\nShop with Points\n\nTop Up Your Account\n\nTop Up Your Account in Store\n\nLet Us Help You\n\nCOVID-19 and Amazon\n\nTrack Packages or View Orders\n\nDelivery Rates & Policies\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nReturns & Replacements\n\nRecycling\n\nManage Your Content and Devices\n\nAmazon Mobile App\n\nAmazon Assistant\n\nCustomer Service\n\nAustralia\n\nBrazil\n\nCanada\n\nChina\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nIndia\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nMexico\n\nNetherlands\n\nPoland\n\nSingapore\n\nSpain\n\nTurkey\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nUnited States\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                     Amazon MusicStream millionsof songs |  |             AbeBooksBooks, art&amp;

VideoMic GO fits R\u00d8DE's Boom Pole and VC1 extension cable accessories, which let you get the mic off-camera, and right up close to your speaking subject for the best possible sound. | \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead more\n\nAvoid These Common Mistakes With Your VideoMic GO and Get The Best Sound\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | \n| Sound Professional: Get Close to Your Subject                    Always get your VideoMic GO as close as you can to the speaking subject for the most professional result - within four feet is ideal. This is why professional sound recordists use a boom, and you can too. Just add a VC1 extension cable and a Micro Boompole, which are fully compatible with VideoMic GO. | Avoid Hiss: Use Manual Audio Recording Mode                    To get the best from any mic and avoid hearing hiss in quiet speaking environments, it\u2019s essential you turn OFF Auto Gain Control in your camera\u2019s movie recording settings - as well as getting the microphone close to the subject. Set the audio levels manually, so that your speaking subject is hitting around the \"-12\", without going too much over. This will give a good level without distortion, and without the camera amplifying background noise when the subject is silent. | Avoid Clicks and Whirrs: Use Manual Focus                    The focusing motor inside some affordable lenses can be surprisingly noisy, and any good sensitive microphone will hear this too. If you do have a noisy lens, do as they do on a professional film set, and focus manually for silent recordings. If you must use autofocus, use the VideoMic GO off-camera with a boom or tripod, and a VC1 extension cable. | Avoid Interference: Turn Camera WiFi Off                    All microphones, including the VideoMic GO, can experience interference from strong external RF fields, such as very close WiFi transmitters. Turning off the WiFi function of your camera whilst filming is always good practice, and can help prevent any potential interference. | \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead more\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                          |                                               |                                                                                   |                                    |                                    |                                        |                                                                    | \n|                                          |                                    VIdeoMicro |                                                                       VIdeoMic GO |                           VIdeoMic |                       VIdeoMic Pro |                          VIdeoMic Pro+ |                                                       VIdeoMic NTG | \n|                               Ideal For: | Camcorders, point and shoot, entry level DSLR | Camcorders, point &amp; shoot, entry-level DSLR (Not compatible with Nikon D7000) |         Camcorders, mid-range DSLR |  High-end DSLR, Full frame cameras |      High-end DSLR, Full frame cameras | High-end DSLR, Full frame cameras, Smartphone and USB Computer Use | \n|                        Built in pre-amp?

I read a lot of reviews on here about certain problems relating to hissing and interference from other equipment and even the cameras. However, this did seem to relate somewhat to the cameras rather that camcorders - or at least that was my impression.\n\nLikewise, there was a potential wind noise problem around the cable connection point on the mike which I have a 'dead cat' for.\n\nFor me the major buying point was the 'not having a battery' because I have shot a lot of footage worrying about the battery in my mike, whether I have a spare and whether they will all last the day. It's also another thing to remember..\n\nAnyway, after my initial quick trial - I have a Panasonic HDC-SD900 Camcorder with which I shoot everything from concerts to Murder Mystery films - I am delighted to report that all has gone well. I don't get any extraneous hiss or noise and although I haven't had a chance to boom test it out doors I have tried the 'blow' test which has been good.\n\nThe sound quality seems fine. The internal mike on my Panasonic is pretty good but when filming scenes especially outside when using a boom then a decent mike is essential. This was not exceptional but was certainly adequate.\n\nIt means that I think that some of the extraneous noises people have been experiencing on cameras may be due to audio settings or just the way their camera operates?\n\nFor me and my camcorder this is just what I need. Like I say it's all about expectations and needs..\n\nRead more\n\n20 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nVicente R.\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars\n\nReally disappointed with it. Any suggestion with my video or anything I will appreciate.\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2017\n\nStyle Name: VideoMic GO\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video.\n\nI am Spanish Teacher and I need to record videos at home, I don't know if the sound is clear for the next video but I expected something better for the price I paid\n\nIf you want to use it at indoors I will not recommend you, is useless I do not know about outdoors.\n\nI tried with my Panasonic Lumix Camera and the sound is exactly the same than the microphone in the camera.\n\nI am wondering if I could get a refund.\n\nPS: The sound you heard is exactly the same without the microphone.\n\n(sorry for the script is an attempt for one of my videos)\n\nRead more\n\n25 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nStephen Condren\n\n4.0 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat sound.

Using this product over a year now and I'm really enjoying it.\n\nSide note anyone using a cannon plugging this in. Make sure you turn off your wifi on your camera. otherwise you sound quality will distort\n\nRead more\n\n19 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nPhilip J.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nLight weight and good value\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2019\n\nStyle Name: VideoMic GO\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI mostly take photographs but there are a few things where video works best so I wanted an external mic to minimize interference from wind and focusing noise, this mic was the right price and came well recommended.\n\nI\u2019ve found it light weight and easy to use with my Canon EOS 6D mk2, I can leave it on and it doesn\u2019t  interfere with stills photography, the instructions don\u2019t seem to tell you but if you undo the cross head screw underneath the mount (see picture) you can place the mic in three positions, fully forward works best for me as it doesn\u2019t get in the way when looking through the viewfinder.\n\nThis is not an expensive mic so don't expect studio quality sound, just an improvement over the built in mic in directionality and eliminating wind and focusing noise.\n\nI didn\u2019t get the \u201cDead Cat\u201d originally but found that the foam cover doesn\u2019t do much in anything more than a light breeze, get them both at once if it\u2019s cheaper, overall a good piece of kit.\n\nRead more\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nLight weight and good value\n\nBy Philip J. on 19 February 2019\n\nI mostly take photographs but there are a few things where video works best so I wanted an external mic to minimize interference from wind and focusing noise, this mic was the right price and came well recommended.\n\nI\u2019ve found it light weight and easy to use with my Canon EOS 6D mk2, I can leave it on and it doesn\u2019t  interfere with stills photography, the instructions don\u2019t seem to tell you but if you undo the cross head screw underneath the mount (see picture) you can place the mic in three positions, fully forward works best for me as it doesn\u2019t get in the way when looking through the viewfinder.\n\nThis is not an expensive mic so don't expect studio quality sound, just an improvement over the built in mic in directionality and eliminating wind and focusing noise.\n\nI didn\u2019t get the \u201cDead Cat\u201d originally but found that the foam cover doesn\u2019t do much in anything more than a light breeze, get them both at once if it\u2019s cheaper, overall a good piece of kit.\n\nImages in this review\n\n10 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nMark\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat for YouTube Vlogs\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2016\n\nStyle Name: VideoMic GO\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nSo simple and easy to use. Connect into your camera with the 3.5mm jack and mount on the hotshot. Job done. The sound this mic picks up makes the in built SLR mic completely redundant and I now wouldn't have it without. I make YT videos and do not need lapel mics because of this. Well worth the investment.\n\nRead more\n\n26 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nSee all reviews\n\nvar isAUI = typeof P === 'object' && typeof P.when === 'function';\n  if(typeof setCSMReq == 'function') {\n        setCSMReq('cf');\n  }else {\n     if(typeof uet == 'function') {\n        uet('cf');\n     }\n     if(isAUI){\n     \t   P.trigger(\"cf\");\n     \t}else{\n     \t\tamznJQ.completedStage('amznJQ.criticalFeature');\n     \t}\n  }\n\nvar isAUI = typeof P === 'object' && typeof P.when === 'function';\n  if(typeof setCSMReq == 'function') {\n        setCSMReq('cf');\n  }else {\n     if(typeof uet == 'function') {\n        uet('cf');\n     }\n     if(isAUI){\n     \t   P.trigger(\"cf\");\n     \t}else{\n     \t\tamznJQ.completedStage('amznJQ.criticalFeature');\n     \t}\n  }\n\n{\"pageRefreshUrlParams\":{\"sid\":\"258-1101613-5181320\",\"ptd\":\"MICROPHONE\",\"json\":\"1\",\"dpxAjaxFlag\":\"1\",\"sCac\":\"1\",\"isUDPFlag\":\"1\",\"twisterView\":\"glance\",\"ee\":\"2\",\"pgid\":\"musical_instruments_display_on_website\",\"tagActionCode\":\"rvaportal-21\",\"rid\":\"TEEXJ2RF3T7X19B60ZZ6\",\"parentAsin\":\"B08NDTT5HD\",\"enPre\":\"1\",\"dcm\":\"1\",\"asinList\":\"B00GQDORA4\",\"numericGLProductGroupID\":\"267\",\"udpWeblabState\":\"T2\",\"storeID\":\"musical-instruments\",\"auiAjax\":\"1\"}}\n\nPages with related products.\n\nSee and discover other items:\n\nred camera\n\n,\n\nsound recorder\n\n,\n\nstudio mic\n\n,\n\nvideo microphone\n\n,\n\ncamera rig\n\n,\n\nBest Rated in Camcorder Accessories\n\nvar ocInitTimestamp = 1620413921;\n\n----\n|  | \n----\n\n{\"rhfHandlerParams\":{\"disableRhfWeblab\":\"\",\"search\":\"\",\"rhfAsins\":\"\",\"noP13NCache\":\"\",\"weblabTriggers\":\"\",\"auiDebug\":\"\",\"keywords\":\"\",\"k\":\"\",\"rviAsins\":\"\",\"url\":\"\",\"parentSession\":\"258-1101613-5181320\",\"rhfState\":\"\",\"contextMetadataOverride\":\"\",\"currentSubPageType\":null,\"field-keywords\":\"\",\"relatedRequestId\":\"TEEXJ2RF3T7X19B60ZZ6\",\"recsAsins\":\"\",\"rhfHorizonteWeblab\":\"\",\"excludeASIN\":\"QjAwR1FET1JBNA==\",\"auditEnabled\":\"\",\"customerId\":\"\",\"testRecsFailure\":\"\",\"previewCampaigns\":\"\",\"forceWidgets\":\"\",\"currentPageType\":\"Detail\",\"stringDebug\":\"\"},\"subPageType\":null,\"requestId\":\"TEEXJ2RF3T7X19B60ZZ6\",\"sessionId\":\"258-1101613-5181320\",\"customerId\":\"\",\"pageType\":\"Detail\",\"ybhHandlerParams\":{\"relatedRequestId\":\"TEEXJ2RF3T7X19B60ZZ6\",\"currentPageType\":\"Detail\",\"parentSession\":\"258-1101613-5181320\"}}\n\nYour recently viewed items and featured recommendations\n\n\u203a\n\nView or edit your browsing history\n\nAfter viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.\n\nYour recently viewed items and featured recommendations\n\n\u203a\n\nView or edit your browsing history\n\nAfter viewing product detail pages, look here to find an easy way to navigate back to pages you are interested in.\n\nBack to top\n\nGet to Know Us\n\nCareers\n\nAbout Us\n\nUK Modern Slavery Statement\n\nSustainability\n\nMake Money with Us\n\nSell on Amazon\n\nSell Under Private Brands\n\nSell on Amazon Business\n\nSell on Amazon Handmade\n\nSell on Amazon Launchpad\n\nAssociates Programme\n\nFulfilment by Amazon\n\nSeller Fulfilled Prime\n\nAdvertise Your Products\n\nIndependently Publish with Us\n\nAmazon Pay\n\nHost an Amazon Hub\n\n\u203a\n\nSee all\n\nAmazon Payment Methods\n\nAmazon Platinum Mastercard\n\nAmazon Classic Mastercard\n\nAmazon Money Store\n\nGift Cards\n\nAmazon Currency Converter\n\nPayment Methods Help\n\nShop with Points\n\nTop Up Your Account\n\nTop Up Your Account in Store\n\nLet Us Help You\n\nCOVID-19 and Amazon\n\nTrack Packages or View Orders\n\nDelivery Rates & Policies\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nReturns & Replacements\n\nRecycling\n\nManage Your Content and Devices\n\nAmazon Mobile App\n\nAmazon Assistant\n\nCustomer Service\n\nAustralia\n\nBrazil\n\nCanada\n\nChina\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nIndia\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nMexico\n\nNetherlands\n\nPoland\n\nSingapore\n\nSpain\n\nTurkey\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nUnited States\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                     Amazon MusicStream millionsof songs |  |             AbeBooksBooks, art&amp;

I can't even begin to imagine what I'd do if a 512GB card crashed!\n\nTwo 32GB cards work out slightly cheaper per gigabyte than one 64GB too (59p compared to 61p). However, it has to be admitted that the larger cards beat them both on price (the 512GB card is around 46p per gigabyte).\n\nRead more\n\n81 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nR.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nA solid card\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2019\n\nColour Name: Black\n\nSize Name: 64GB\n\nStyle Name: UHS-I CARD ONLY\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI've always opted for SanDisk Extreme Pro SD cards because I've found they provide me exactly what I need for my camera.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good writing speed for photography and uploading to PC\n\n2. Enough storage size for a good price.\n\n3. I feel safer using this card, it seems based on my experience with other brands that there's a lower chance of SanDisk Extreme Pro cards malfunctioning.\n\n4. It also looks nice (I don't know if this is something people care about, but I like it)\n\nCons:\n\n1. I can't comment on tech support, as I haven't had to use it.\n\n2. Writing speed not 170MB/s (so the described speed actually refers to the read speed, but if you want speeds like this, you have to be willing to pay loads more, no matter the brand. Write speed is still fast enough for all the photos and videos I've ever had to shoot).\n\nRead more\n\n50 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nBen23\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars\n\nSevere reliability problems with iMac\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2019\n\nColour Name: Black\n\nSize Name: 64GB\n\nStyle Name: UHS-I CARD ONLY\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI bought two of these cards to use in my Panasonic Lumix G9 and G80 cameras, where they appear to work fine (though they are no faster than my previous gold Extreme cards). However, they are proving to be extremely unreliable when inserted into my (late 2015) iMac's built-in card reader. Sometimes they work (though again, the read speed is no faster than the older cards), but a lot of the time they don't. They mount fine, but the image files are either absent, or they start off present and then disappear from the folders or can't be read. Fortunately, the files are actually still there, and by putting the card back in the camera and downloading over USB I was able to read them. But because of this, I don't 100% trust them, and will only use them in my G9 with an Extreme card in the second slot as backup.\n\nThese cards have also had issues with some Sony cameras (see other reviews) which leads me to believe there is a particular problem with the ones designated 170MB/s.\n\nI have confirmed that the cards have their stated capacity using the F3 program, and I don't believe they're fake (I also bought them direct from Amazon, not from a Marketplace seller).\n\nI have always used Sandisk cards because they have always been reliable, but they seem to have dropped the ball on these ones, perhaps by bending the UHS-I standard a little too much in the pursuit of a higher headline read speed (which you will never see in a standard card reader anyway).\n\nRead more\n\n32 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nBobble\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nHandles 4K video nicely\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2019\n\nColour Name: Black\n\nSize Name: 128GB\n\nStyle Name: UHS-I CARD ONLY\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nReview for: SanDisk Extreme PRO 128 GB SDXC Memory Card (170MB/s)\n\nUsing inside a very good camera and it copes with 4K 50fps vide nicely.

This is a picture of me, right around the time that my grandma was diagnosed with end-stage heart disease and sent home to die. She had already had so many bypass operations, basically ran out of plumbing at some point, confined to a wheelchair, and there was nothing more they could do. \u00a0Her life was over at age 65. But then, she heard about this guy, Nathan Pritikin, one of our early lifestyle medicine pioneers.\n\nAnd what happened next is chronicled in Pritikin\u2019s biography. My grandma was one of the \u201cdeath\u2019s door\u201d people. Frances Greger arrived in a wheelchair. \u201cMrs. Greger had heart disease, angina, and claudication; her condition was so bad she could no longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs. \u00a0Within three weeks, though she was not only out of her wheelchair but was walking ten miles a day.\u201d\n\nThis is my grandma at her grandson\u2019s wedding 15 years after she was given her medical death sentence, and thanks to a healthy diet, she was able to live\u00a0another 31 years on this earth\u2014until 96\u2014to enjoy her six grandkids, including me.\n\nThat is why I went into medicine.\n\nWhen Dr. Ornish published his Lifestyle Heart Trial years later, proving with quantitative angiography that coronary artery\u00a0disease could indeed be reversed in the majority of patients without drugs or surgery\u2014just a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle changes, I assumed that it was going to be a game-changer. My family had seen it with their own eyes, but finally here it was in black and white, published in one of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals on the planet. But, nothing happened\u2014 leaving me to wonder if, effectively, the cure to our #1\u00a0killer could get lost down some rabbit hole and ignored, then, what else might be in the medical literature that can help my patients? I made it my life\u2019s mission to find out.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with my work, every year I read through every issue of every English-language nutrition journal in the world\u2014so busy folks like you don\u2019t have to.\n\nI then compile all the most interesting, the most groundbreaking, the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day to\u00a0my nonprofit site, NutritionFacts.org.\n\nEverything on the website is free. There are no ads, no corporate sponsorships. It\u2019s strictly noncommercial, not selling anything. I just put it up as a public service, as a labor of love.\n\nNew videos and articles\n\nevery day\n\n, on the latest in\n\nevidence-based\n\nnutrition. What a concept!\n\nWhere did Pritikin get his evidence from? A network of missionary hospitals set up by Western doctors throughout sub-Saharan Africa uncovered what may be one of the most important advances in health, according to one of our\u00a0most famous medical figures of the 20th century, Dr. Denis Burkitt: the fact that many of the most common and major diseases \u201cin modern Western culture are universally rare in third world communities.\u201d\n\nLike, heart disease. This landmark article from the 50s started out with a shocking statement: \u201cIn the African population of Uganda, coronary heart disease is almost non-existent.\u201d Wait a second, our #1 cause of death, almost nonexistent? What were they eating?\n\nThey were eating a lot of starchy vegetables, starchy grains, and greens, and their protein almost exclusively\u00a0from plant sources, and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it. Actually, very similar to those eating modern-day, plant-based diets.\n\nMaybe the Africans were just dying early from some\u00a0other kind of diseases\u2014and so, never lived long enough to have a heart attack? No, here are\n\nage-matched\n\nheart attack rates in Uganda versus St. Louis. Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda, only one myocardial infarction. Out of 632 age- and gender-matched autopsies in Missouri, 136 myocardial infarctions: more than 100 times the rate of our #1 killer.\n\nIn fact, they were so blown away they went back and did another 800 autopsies in Uganda, and still, just that one small healed infarct (meaning it wasn\u2019t even the cause of death) out of 1,427 patients\u2014less than one in a thousand; whereas here, heart disease is an epidemic.\n\nThis is a list of diseases commonly found in the U.S. (and in populations that eat and live like the U.S.), but are rare or even nonexistent in populations centering their diets around\n\nwhole plant foods\n\n.\n\nThese are among our most\n\ncommon\n\ndiseases, like obesity, for example, or hiatal hernia, one of the most common stomach problems. Varicose veins and hemorrhoids\u2014two of the most common venous problems; colorectal cancer\u2014a leading cause of cancer-related death; diverticulitis\u2014the #1 disease of the intestines; appendicitis\u2014the #1 cause of\u00a0emergency abdominal surgery; gallbladder disease\u2014the #1 cause of\n\nnonemergency\n\nabdominal surgery; as well as\u00a0ischemic heart disease\u2014the\n\ncommonest cause of death\n\nhere, but a rarity among plant-based populations.\n\nThis suggests heart disease may be a\n\nchoice\n\n. Like cavities. If you look at the teeth of people who lived over 10,000 years before the invention of the toothbrush, they pretty much had no cavities. Didn\u2019t brush a day in their lives; no flossing; yet, no cavities. That\u2019s because candy bars hadn\u2019t been invented yet.\n\nWhy do people continue to get cavities when we know they\u2019re preventable through diet? Simple. Because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist\u2019s chair for many people. And, that\u2019s fine!\n\nLook, as long as people understand the consequences of their actions, as a physician, what more can I do? If you\u2019re an adult, and decide the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family, then, go for it\u2014I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence (I\u2019ve got a good dental plan).\n\nBut, what if instead of the plaque on our teeth, we\u2019re talking about the plaque building up inside of our arteries? This is another disease that can be prevented by changing our diet.\n\nNow, what are the consequences for you and your family? Now, we\u2019re not talking about scraping tartar anymore. Now, we\u2019re talking life and death. The most likely reason that most of our loved ones will die is because of heart disease. It\u2019s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live\u2014but we should make these\u00a0choices consciously, educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions.\n\nCoronary heart disease; atherosclerosis; hardening of the arteries, begins in\n\nchildhood\n\n.\n\nBy age 10, the arteries of nearly all kids raised on the standard American diet already have fatty streaks\u2014the first stage of the disease.\n\nThen, these plaques start forming in our 20s, get worse in our 30s, and then, can start killing us off. In our hearts, it\u2019s called a heart attack; in our brains, the same disease is\u00a0called a stroke.\n\nIf there is\n\nanyone\n\nin this audience older than age 10, then the question\u00a0isn\u2019t whether or not to eat healthy to\n\nprevent\n\nheart disease; it\u2019s whether you want to\n\nreverse\n\nthe heart disease that you already have.\n\nIs that even possible? When researchers took people with heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by those populations that didn\u2019t suffer from heart disease, their hope was to slow the disease process down\u2014maybe even stop it. But instead, something miraculous happened.\n\nThe disease started to reverse, to get better. As soon as patients stopped eating an artery-clogging diet, their arteries started opening up. \u00a0Their bodies were able to start dissolving some of the plaque away. Even in some cases of severe triple vessel heart disease, arteries opened up without drugs, without surgery\u2014suggesting their bodies wanted to heal all along, but were just never given the chance. This improvement in blood flow to the heart is after just three weeks of eating healthy.\n\nLet me share with you the best-kept secret in medicine. The best-kept secret in medicine is that sometimes, given the right conditions, our\u00a0body can heal itself.\n\nIf you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get all red, hot, swollen, and inflamed, but will heal naturally if we just stand back and let our body work its magic. But what if we\n\nkept\n\nwhacking it in the same place three times a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) every day? It\u2019d never heal.\n\nYou\u2019d go to your doctor and say, \u201cMy shin hurts.\u201d And the doctor would be like, no problem, whip out their pad, and write you a prescription for painkillers. You\u2019re still whacking your shin three times a day, but it feels so much better with the pain pills on board. Thank heavens for modern medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s like when taking\u00a0nitroglycerine for crushing chest pain. Tremendous relief, but you\u2019re not actually treating the underlying cause of the disease.\n\nOur body wants to come back to health, if we let it. But if we keep re-injuring it three times a day, we may never heal.\n\nIt\u2019s like smoking. One of the most\n\namazing\n\nthings I learned in medical school was that within about 15 years of stopping smoking, our lung cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Our lungs can clear out all that tar, and eventually, it\u2019s almost as if\u00a0we never started smoking at all.\n\nEvery morning of our smoking life, that healing process started until, wham, our first cigarette of the day, re-injuring our lungs with every puff. Just like we can re-injure our arteries with every bite, when all we had to do all along\u2014the miracle cure, was to just stand back, get out of the way, stop re-damaging ourselves, and let our bodies\u2019 natural healing processes bring us back towards health.\n\nSure, you could choose moderation, and hit yourself with a smaller hammer. But why beat yourself up at all?\n\nThe human body is a self-healing machine.\n\nWe\u2019ve known about this for decades.\n\nAmerican Heart Journal\n\n, 1977: cases like Mr. F.W. here; such severe angina he couldn\u2019t even make it to the mailbox, but then started eating healthier, and a few months later, he was climbing mountains, no pain.\n\nThere are some fancy new anti-angina drugs on the market now that cost thousands of dollars a year. But at the highest dose, they can successfully prolong exercise duration, extending the time someone can walk on a treadmill as long as 33\u00a01/2\u00a0seconds.\n\nIt does not look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.\n\nYou see, plant-based diets aren\u2019t just safer and cheaper, but they\u00a0can work\n\nbetter\n\n.\n\nKiller #2\u00a0is cancer. What happens if we put cancer on a plant-based diet? Dean Ornish and colleagues found that the progression of prostate cancer could be reversed with a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle behaviors\u2014and no wonder.\n\nIf you drip the blood of those eating the standard American diet onto cancer cells growing in a petri dish, cancer growth is cut down by about 9%. But put people on a plant-based diet for a year, though, and their blood can do this. The blood circulating within the bodies of those eating\u00a0plant-based diets has nearly eight\u00a0times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth.\n\nNow, this was for prostate cancer\u2014the leading cancer killer specific to men. In women, it\u2019s breast cancer. So, researchers tried duplicating the study with women, using breast cancer cells instead. They didn\u2019t want to wait a whole year to get the results, though. So, they figured they\u2019d see what a healthy diet could do in just two weeks, against three different types of human breast cancer cells.\n\nThis was the before: cancer growth powering away at 100%. And then, after eating a plant-based diet for 14 days.\n\nHere\u2019s the before picture: a layer of breast cancer cells is laid down in a petri dish, and then blood from women eating the standard American diet is dripped on them. And as you can see, even people eating crappy diets have some ability to break down cancer. But after just two\u00a0weeks eating healthy, blood was drawn from those same women\u2014so, they acted as their own controls\u2014dripped on another carpet of breast cancer cells, and this is what they were left with; just a few individual cancer cells left. Their bodies just cleaned up.\n\nBefore, and after; just two weeks eating healthy. Their blood became that much more hostile to cancer.\n\nSlowing down the growth of cancer cells is nice, but getting rid of them is even better. This is what\u2019s called apoptosis, programmed cell death. After eating healthy, their own bodies were able to reprogram the cancer cells, forcing them into early retirement.\n\nThis is what\u2019s called TUNEL imaging, measuring\u00a0DNA fragmentation or cell death. Dying cells show up as white spots. So, again, this is the before\u2014what the blood of the average woman eating a standard American diet can do to breast cancer cells. Her blood may be able to kill off a few. But then, after 14 days of healthy plant-based living, her blood can do this. It\u2019s like she\u2019s an entirely different person inside.\n\nThe same blood that was now coursing through these women\u2019s bodies gained the power to significantly slow down and stop breast cancer cell growth, within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\nof eating a plant-based diet.\n\nWhat kind of blood do we want in our body; what kind of immune system? Do we want blood that just kind of rolls over when new cancer cells pop up, or do we want blood circulating to every nook and cranny of our body with the power to slow down and stop them?\n\nNow, this dramatic strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plant-based diet\n\nand\n\nexercise; they had these women\u00a0out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day. Well, wait a second, if you do two things, how do you know what role the diet played? So, the researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\nThis is measuring cancer cell clearance. This is what we saw before; the effect of blood taken from those who ate a plant-based diet\u2014in this case for an average of 14 years\u2014along with mild exercise, like just walking every day. Plant-based diet and walking\u2014that\u2019s the kind of cancer cell clearance you get. Compare that to the cancer-stopping power of your average sedentary meat-eater, which is basically nonexistent.\n\nThis middle group is interesting, though. Instead of 14 years on a plant-based diet, ate 14 years of a standard American diet\u2014\n\nbut\n\n, had 14 years of daily, strenuous, hour-long exercise, like calisthenics.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if you exercise long enough, if you exercise hard enough, can you rival some strolling plant-eaters?\n\nAnd the answer is, exercise helped\u2014no question, but literally 5,000 hours in the gym was no match for a plant-based diet.\n\nSame thing as before. Even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes, your body\u2019s not totally defenseless. Your bloodstream can kill off a few cancer cells. But here\u2019s the hard core strenuous exercise group, killing off cancer cells left and right.\n\nBut nothing appears to kick more cancer tush than a plant-based diet.\n\nWe think it\u2019s because of the animal proteins\u2014meat, egg white, and dairy proteins\u2014increasing the level of IGF-1 in our bodies. Insulin-like growth factor-1, a cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in the acquisition and progression of malignant tumors.\n\nBut if we lower animal protein intake, if you put people on a plant-based diet, their IGF-1 levels go down, and if you put people\u00a0on a plant-based diet for years, their levels drop even further.\n\nAnd their IGF-1\n\nbinding protein\n\nlevels go up. That\u2019s one way our body tries to protect itself from cancer\u2014from excessive growth\u2014by releasing a binding protein into our bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF-1. It\u2019s like our body\u2019s emergency brake. Yes, in as little as two\u00a0weeks, a plant-based diet can bring down your liver\u2019s production of IGF-1 . But what about all the IGF-1 circulating in your bloodstream from the bacon and eggs you had three weeks before? So, your liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to take it out of circulation. And, as you can see, it just gets better and better, the longer you eat healthy.\n\nHere\u2019s the experiment that nailed IGF-1 as the villain; same as last time. Go on a plant-based diet, cancer cell growth drops, and cancer cell death shoots up. But then, here\u2019s the kicker: what if you added back to the cancer the exact same amount of IGF-1 banished from your system just\u00a0because you were eating healthy for two weeks? It erases the diet and exercise effect. It\u2019s like you never started eating healthy at all.\n\nSo, the reason the largest prospective study on diet and cancer ever found that the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meat-eaters may be because they eat less animal protein. So, they end up with less IGF-1, which can mean less cancer growth.\n\nHow much less cancer are we talking about? Middle-aged men and women with high protein intakes had a 75% increase in total\u00a0mortality, and a four\n\n\u2013\n\nfold\u00a0increase in the risk of dying from cancer. But not all proteins; specifically animal protein, which makes sense, of course, given the higher IGF-1 levels.\n\nThe academic institution sent out a press release with a memorable opening line: \u201cThat chicken wing you\u2019re eating could be as deadly as a cigarette,\u201d explaining that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer\u2014\u201da mortality risk factor comparable to smoking.\u201d\n\nWhat was the response to the revelation that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking? One nutrition scientist replied that it was potentially dangerous to compare the effects of smoking with the effect of meat and cheese. Why? Because a smoker might think, \u201cWhy bother quitting smoking if my ham\u00a0and cheese\u00a0sandwich is just as bad for me?\u201d So, better not to tell anyone about the whole meat and dairy thing.\n\nThat reminds me of a famous Philip Morris cigarette ad that tried to downplay the risks by saying, \u201cYou think secondhand smoke is bad, increasing the risk of lung cancer 19%? Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of milk every day may be three times as bad\u201462% increased\u00a0risk of lung cancer.\u201d Or doubling the risk by frequently cooking with oil, or tripling your risk of heart disease by eating non-vegetarian, or multiplying your risk six-fold by eating lots of meat and dairy. So, they conclude, \u201cLet\u2019s keep a sense of\n\nperspective\n\nhere.\u201d The risk of lung cancer from secondhand smoke may be \u201cwell below the risk reported for other everyday activities.\u201d So, breathe deep.\n\nThat\u2019s like saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about getting stabbed, because getting shot is so much worse.\u201d\n\nUh, how about neither? Two risks don\u2019t make a right.\n\nYou\u2019ll note Philip Morris stopped throwing dairy under the bus when they purchased Kraft Foods.\n\nOkay, what about the other\u00a013 leading causes of death?\n\nThe top three killers used to be heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Oh, that is\n\nso\n\n2007. Now, it\u2019s heart disease, cancer, and COPD\u2014chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, like emphysema. Thankfully, COPD can be prevented with the help of a plant-based diet, and even treated with plants; improving lung function over time.\n\nOf course, the tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently. Instead of adding plants to one\u2019s\n\ndiet\n\nto help one\u2019s lung function, wouldn\u2019t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes? And indeed, the addition of a\u00e7a\u00ed berries to cigarettes evidently has a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice. Who would have thunk it?\n\nNext, they\u2019re going to be putting berries in meat. And indeed, I couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. The addition of\u00a0fruit extracts to burgers was not without its glitches, though. The blackberries \u201cliterally dyed burger patties with a distinct purplish colour\u201d\u2014though, evidently, infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in does evidently improve tenderness. And, it\u2019s even possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurters with powdered grape seeds, though, there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product. And if there\u2019s one thing we know about hot dog-eaters, it\u2019s that they\u2019re picky about what goes in their food.\n\nPig anus? Okay, but grape seeds? Eww!\n\nStrokes are killer #4. Preventing strokes may be all about eating potassium-rich foods, yet most Americans don\u2019t even reach the recommended\n\nminimum\n\ndaily intake. And by most, I mean more than 98%. 98% of us eat potassium-deficient diets, because 98% of us don\u2019t eat enough plants.\n\nPotassium comes from the words pot ash. You take any plant, put it in a pot, and reduce it to ash, and you\u2019re left with pot-ash-ium, so-called vegetable alkali. True story, but can anyone name me a plant food particularly high in potassium?\n\nBananas, right? I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s like the one thing everyone knows about nutrition. Chiquita must have had a great PR firm or something. But it turns out that bananas don\u2019t even make the top 50 sources, coming in at number 86, right behind fast food vanilla milk shakes. It goes fast food vanilla milk shakes,\n\nthen\n\nbananas.\n\nIn fact, when I was researching for my new book, I found out that the USDA expanded their list, and now bananas don\u2019t even make the top\n\nthousand\n\nsources\n\n;\n\ncoming in at number 1,611, right after Reese\u2019s Pieces. I kid you not. The most concentrated whole food sources of potassium in the diet are: beans, and greens, and dates.\n\nBananas don\u2019t make it to a thousand\u2014in fact, if you look at the next leading cause of death (unintentional injuries), bananas could be downright dangerous.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is now our sixth leading killer, now striking\u00a0a staggering four\u00a0million Americans affected. Twenty\u00a0years ago, it wasn\u2019t even in the top ten. According to the latest dietary guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s, the two most important things we can do: cut down our consumption of meat, dairy, and junk; and replace those\u00a0with vegetables, beans, fruits, and whole grains.\n\nThis is based, in part, on data going back over 20\u00a0years now. Those who eat meat\u2014red meat or white meat, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014appear between two\u00a0to three\u00a0times more likely to become demented later in life, compared to those that don\u2019t eat meat. And the longer one eats meat-free, the lower the risk of dementia drops.\n\nNext on the list: type 2 diabetes, which we can prevent, arrest, and reverse with a plant-based diet\u2014something we\u2019ve known since back in the 1930s. Within five\u00a0years, about a quarter of the diabetics were able to get off insulin.\n\nBut plant-based diets are low-calorie diets. Maybe their diabetes just got better because they lost so much weight? To tease that out, what we would need is a study where researchers switch people to a healthy diet, but force them to eat so much food that they wouldn\u2019t\u00a0lose any weight, despite eating healthier. Then, we could see if plant-based diet had unique benefits beyond all the weight loss. We\u2019d have to wait 44 years, but here it is: subjects were weighed every day, and if they started losing weight, they were made to eat more food. In fact, so much food, some of the participants had problems\u00a0eating it all\u2014like \u201cnot another tostada, not another salad.\u201d But they eventually adapted; so, there was no significant alteration in body weight, despite restricting meat, dairy, eggs, and junk.\n\nSo, with zero weight loss, did a plant-based diet still help? Overall, insulin requirements were cut about 60%, and half were able to get off insulin altogether despite no change in weight. How many years did this\u00a0take? No, 16\n\ndays\n\n.\n\nSo, we\u2019re talking diabetics who\u2019ve had diabetes for as long as 20\u00a0years, injecting 20 units of insulin a day. And then, as few as 13 days later, they\u2019re off of all insulin altogether, thanks to less than two weeks on a plant-based diet\u2014even with zero weight loss. Diabetes for 20 years, then off all insulin in two\u00a0weeks. Diabetes for 20 years, because no one had told them about a plant-based diet. Here\u2019s patient 15; 32 units of insulin on the control diet, and then, 18 days later, on none. Lower blood sugars on 32 units\n\nless\n\ninsulin. That\u2019s the power of plants. This was without weight loss; his body just started working that much better.\n\nAnd as a bonus, their cholesterol dropped like a rock to under 150, in just 16 days. Just like moderate changes in diet usually result in only modest reductions in cholesterol, how moderate do you want your diabetes?\n\nEverything in moderation may be a truer statement than many people realize. Moderate changes in diet can leave diabetics with moderate vision loss, moderate kidney failure, and moderate amputations\u2014maybe just a few\u00a0toes or something? Moderation in all things is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nThat study that purported to show that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking supposedly suggested that people who eat lots of animal protein are four times as likely to die from cancer or diabetes. But if you look at the actual study, you\u2019ll see that\u2019s not true. Those eating lots of animal protein didn\u2019t have just four\u00a0times more risk of dying from diabetes;\n\nthey had 73 times higher risk of dying from diabetes.\n\nThose who chose moderation\u2014eating a moderate amount of animal protein\u2014only had 23 times the risk of death from diabetes.\n\nKiller #8 is kidney failure, which may be both prevented and treated with a plant-based diet. And no surprise; kidneys are highly vascular organs. Harvard researchers found three dietary risk factors for declining kidney function: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. Animal fat can alter the actual structure of our kidneys, based on studies like this, showing plugs of fat literally clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys.\n\nAnd the animal\n\nprotein\n\ncan have a profound effect on normal kidney function, inducing what\u2019s called hyperfiltration; increasing the workload on the kidney, but not plant protein. Eat some\u00a0tuna fish, and you can see increased pressure on the kidneys one, two, and three\u00a0hours after the meal; shoots right up. If, instead of having a tuna salad sandwich, though, you\u00a0had a\n\ntofu\n\nsalad sandwich with the same amount of protein, no effect. Kidneys can deal with plant protein\u00a0without even batting an eyelash.\n\nWhy does\n\nanimal\n\nprotein cause the overload reaction, but not plant protein? It appears to be due to inflammation triggered by the animal protein. We know this because if you give a powerful anti-inflammatory drug along with the tuna fish, you can actually abolish that hyperfiltration effect, that protein leakage effect in response to meat ingestion.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the acid load. Animal protein induces the formation of acid within the kidney, which may lead to tubular toxicity: damage to the delicate urine-making tubes within the kidney. Animal foods tend to be acid-forming, whereas plant foods tend to either be relatively neutral or actually alkaline,\n\nbase\n\n-forming, to counteract some of that acid. So, the solution to halting the progression of chronic kidney disease might lie\u00a0in the produce aisle\u00a0rather than the pharmacy aisle.\n\nNo wonder plant-based diets have been used to\n\ntreat\n\nkidney disease for decades. Here\u2019s protein leakage on the low-sodium diet that physicians would conventionally put these patients on; switched to a supplemented vegan diet; conventional; plant-based; conventional; plant-based\u2014turning kidney dysfunction on and off like a light switch, based on what\u2019s going into their mouths.\n\nKiller #9 is respiratory infections. What possible role could diet play? You obviously haven\u2019t seen my video\n\nKale and the Immune System\n\n, talking about the immunostimulatory effects of kale. Is there anything kale cannot do?\n\nBoosting antibody production seven-fold; but that\u2019s in a petri dish. What about in people? Older men and women were split into two groups right before they were going to get their Pneumovax vaccination (their pneumonia vaccination). Half continued to eat as they always had. The other half added just a few servings of fruits and vegetables to their daily diet, and after getting their injection, you can see a significant improvement in the protective antibody immune response from that one simple change. That wasn\u2019t cutting out meat; just adding fruits and vegetables can significantly improve immune function.\n\nKiller #10 is suicide. We\u2019ve known those eating healthier have healthier mood states\u2014in fact, only about half the depression, anxiety, and stress scores compared to those that eat meat. Researchers suspect it\u2019s the arachidonic acid, this\u00a0inflammatory long chain omega-6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs. That\u2019s where it\u2019s predominantly found in the American diet. But you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s cause and effect, until you put it to the test.\n\nThey took people eating the standard American diet, and removed meat, fish, poultry, and eggs from their diets, and got a significant improvement in mood scores within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\n. Thanks, perhaps, to the removal of arachidonic acid from their bodies, which they thought may be adversely impacting mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation; brain inflammation, but we\u00a0could bring that down\u00a0within a matter of weeks after cutting eggs, chicken, and other meat.\n\nNow, am I just cherry picking, though? What about all the randomized controlled trials like that, showing that\n\nother\n\ndiets have improved mood?\n\nThere aren\u2019t any.\n\nA recent review concluded that\n\nonly\n\nthe plant-based study fit the bill. It\u2019s hard to cherry pick when there\u2019s only one cherry.\n\nWorks in a workplace setting too: significant increases in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health\u2014not surprisingly, translating into improved work productivity. The biggest such study, across 15 corporate sites at Geico, found that plant-based diets resulted in significant reported improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and emotional well-being. So, lifestyle interventions, such as exercise, can help\n\nmental\n\nas well as physical health. And among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets.\n\nKiller #11 is blood infections. Sure, foodborne bacteria can kind of burrow through the bloodstream and directly invade through the intestinal wall\u2014but in women, may creep up into their bladder.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for decades that it\u2019s bacteria creeping up from the rectum that cause bladder infections. But only recently did we figure out where that rectal reservoir of bladder-infecting\n\nE. coli\n\nwas coming from: chicken. We now have DNA fingerprinting proof of a direct link between farm animals, meat, and bladder infections\u2014solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis, bladder infections as an animal-to-human disease.\n\nWait a second. Can\u2019t I\u00a0just use a meat thermometer and cook the meat through? No, because of cross-contamination. We\u2019ve known for decades that if you give someone a frozen chicken to prepare and cook in their own kitchen as they normally would, a multitude of antibiotic-resistant\n\nE. coli\n\njump from the chicken into the gut of the volunteer \u2014before they even eat it! So, you could incinerate it to ash; you don\u2019t even have to eat any of it. And it still wouldn\u2019t matter, because you already infected yourself just handling it.\n\nWithin days, the drug-resistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person\u2019s gut flora. The chicken bacteria were like taking over their intestines.\n\nEven if you follow all the safe handling guidelines, rinsing everything with bleach\u2014even spraying bleach on for good measure, there still may be pathogenic fecal bacteria left behind. No one actually does this, but what if you did this, and then came in later and swabbed kitchen surfaces? Researchers found pathogenic fecal bacteria: salmonella, campylobacter\u2014both serious human pathogens, still left behind in the kitchen. The reason that most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen sink than on their toilet seat is because most people rinse chickens in the sink, not the toilet. So, unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab, the only way to guarantee we\u2019re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into our homes in the first place.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s not like you eat chicken once, and you\u2019re colonized for life. In this study, the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about ten\u00a0days before our good bacteria were able to muscle them out of the way. The problem is that most families eat chicken more than once every ten days; so, they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems.\n\nBut wait a second. You can\u2019t sell unsafe cars; you can\u2019t sell unsafe toys; how is it legal to sell unsafe meat?\n\nThey do it by blaming the consumer. As one USDA poultry microbiologist said: \u201cRaw meats are not idiot-proof. They can be mishandled and when they are, it\u2019s like handling a hand grenade. If you pull the pin, somebody\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d See, if we get sick, it\u2019s our fault.\n\nWhile some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in supermarkets, the USDA poultry expert disagrees. \u201cI think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it.\u201d That\u2019s like a car company saying yeah, we installed faulty brakes, but it\u2019s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt.\n\nThe head of the CDC\u2019s food poisoning division responded famously to this kind of blame-the-victim attitude coming from the meat industry. \u201cIs it reasonable that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger, their three-year-old dies?\u201d Is that reasonable?\n\nNot to worry, though: the meat industry is on it. They got the FDA approval for a bacteria-eating virus to spray on the meat. Now, the industry is concerned that consumer acceptance of bacteria-eating viruses may present something of a challenge to the food industry. But if they think that\u2019s going to be a challenge, check out their other bright idea.\n\nThe \u201cEffect of Extracted Housefly Pupae Peptide Mixture on Chilled Pork Preservation\u201d\u2014this is a science-y way of saying they want to smear a maggot mixture on meat.\n\nNow wait\u2014it\u2019s a low-cost and simple method. Think about it; maggots thrive on rotting meat. However, there have been no reports that maggots have any serious diseases; so, they must be packed with some sort of antibacterial something. Have you ever seen a maggot sneeze? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\nSo, they took maggots at three\u00a0days old, washed them, toweled them off, a little Vitamix action, and voil\u00e0! Safer meat.\n\nWe did kidney failure; what about liver failure? We\u2019ve known for decades that a plant-based diet could be used to treat liver failure, significantly reducing the toxins that would otherwise build up eating meat, without a fully functional liver to detoxify your blood.\n\nI do have to admit, though, that some people on plant-based diets have\n\nworsening\n\nliver function. They\u2019re called alcoholics.\u00a0Living on potatoes, corn, grapes, and barley\u2014in fact,\n\nstrictly\n\nplant-based, yet still not doing so hot.\n\nHigh blood pressure is next, affecting nearly 78 million Americans. That\u2019s one in three of us. And as we age, our pressures get higher and higher, such that by age 60, it strikes more than half.\n\nWait a second. If it affects most of us when we get older, maybe it\u2019s less a disease, and more just an inevitable consequence of aging? No. We\u2019ve known since the 1920s that high blood pressure need not occur.\n\nResearchers measured the blood pressures of a thousand people in rural Kenya who ate a diet centered around whole plant foods. Starchy vegetables, whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafies. Our pressures go up as we age; their pressures actually go down.\n\nAnd, the lower the better. The whole 140 over 90 cut-off is arbitrary. \u00a0Even people who start out with blood pressure under 120 over 80 appear to benefit from blood pressure reduction. So, the ideal blood pressure, the no-benefit-from-reducing-it-further blood pressure, is actually 110 over 70. But is it even possible to get blood pressures down to 110 over 70? It\u2019s not just possible; it\u2019s normal\u2014for those eating healthy enough diets.\n\nOver two years at a rural Kenyan hospital, 1,800 patients were admitted. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. Wow! So, they must have had low rates of heart disease. No, they had no rates of heart disease. Not a single case of arteriosclerosis, our #1 killer, was found.\n\nRural China too; about 110 over 70 their entire lives. 70-year-olds had the same average blood pressure as 16-year-olds. Now, of course, Africa and China have vastly different diets, but they share this common theme, that they are plant-based day-to-day, with meat only eaten on special occasions.\n\nWhy do we think it\u2019s the plant-based nature of their diets that was so protective? Because in the Western world, as the American Heart Association has pointed out, the only folks really getting down that low are those eating\u00a0strictly plant-based diets, coming in at an average of\u00a0110 over 65.\n\nBased on the largest study of those eating plant-based diets to date\u201489,000 Californians\u2014there appears to be a stepwise drop in blood pressure\u00a0rates as people eat more and more plant-based.\n\nSame thing with diabetes and obesity. The more and more healthy we eat, the better. Yes, you can wipe out most of your risk eating strictly plant-based, but it\u2019s not black and white, all or nothing. Any movement along the spectrum towards healthier eating can accrue significant benefits.\n\nYou can show this experimentally. You take vegetarians and give them meat, pay them enough to eat it, and their blood pressures go up. Or, you remove meat from their diet, and their blood pressures go down\u2014in just seven\u00a0days! And this is after the vast majority reduced or stopped their blood pressure medications completely. They had to reduce their medications because their pressures were getting so low that if they were on drugs, they could fall over and crack their heads open! \u00a0Lower pressures on fewer drugs; that\u2019s the power of plants.\n\nSo, does the American Heart Association recommend a no-meat diet? No, they recommend a low-meat diet, the so-called DASH diet. Why not vegetarian? When the DASH diet was created, were they just not aware of this landmark research, done by Harvard\u2019s Frank Sacks? No, they were aware of the landmark research. The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Frank Sacks.\n\nSee, the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the #1 goal of capturing the blood pressure-lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet, yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public. They didn\u2019t think the public could handle the truth.\n\nIn their defense, you can see what they were thinking. Just like drugs\n\nnever work\n\nunless you actually take them, diets never work unless you actually eat them. So, you can\u2019t tell people to eat plant-based\u2014they won\u2019t do it. So, they figured they might help more on a population scale if they just soft-pedaled the truth\u00a0to make it more acceptable. Alright,\u00a0tell that to the thousand families\n\na day\n\nthat lose a loved one to high blood pressure. Maybe it\u2019s time to tell the American public the truth.\n\nKiller #14 is Parkinson\u2019s disease. Does a plant-based diet reduce risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease? Well, most studies to date do suggest a link between dairy products and Parkinson\u2019s\u2014but why?\n\nWell, there\u2019s evidence that milk is contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals. High levels of pesticide residues are found in the milk supply, and in the brains of people who die from Parkinson\u2019s disease. And there are other pollutants, like tetrahydroisoquiniline, which is actually what scientists use to try to induce Parkinson\u2019s in primates\u2014and which is found mostly in cheese. So, maybe the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of the milk supply. Good luck with that.\n\nYou could always just not drink it, but then, what would happen to your bones? That\u2019s a marketing ploy; if you look at the actual science, milk does\n\nnot\n\nappear to protect against hip fracture risk, whether drinking during your adult years, or drinking milk during your teen years. If anything, milk consumption was associated with an\n\nincrease\n\nin fracture risk. \u00a0Maybe this is why hip fracture rates are\n\nhighest\n\nin populations with the greatest milk consumption, where they drink the most milk. Swedish researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\n100,000\u00a0men and women followed for up to 20 years, and milk-drinking women had higher rates of death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer, for each daily glass of milk. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of premature death.\n\nAnd they had significantly more bone and hip fractures, too. More milk, more fractures. Milk-drinking men also had higher rates of death. But for some reason, you never see milk ads like this [image of milk carton among gravestones].\n\nFinally, aspiration pneumonia, which is caused by swallowing problems due to Parkinson\u2019s, or Alzheimer\u2019s, or a stroke\u2014all of which we\u2019ve already covered.\n\nSo, where does this leave us? These are the top fifteen reasons that Americans die, and a plant-based diet can help prevent nearly all of them; can help treat more than half of them; and, even, in some cases, even reverse the progression of disease, including our top three killers.\n\nThere are drugs that, in some circumstances, can help, too. You can take one drug to treat cholesterol every day for the rest of your life; another drug for blood sugars; a couple different pills for high blood pressure.\n\nThe\n\nsame\n\ndiet, though, does it all! It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a liver-healthy diet, and a\u00a0heart-healthy diet and a different brain-healthy diet. No, a liver-healthy diet is a heart-healthy diet, is a brain-healthy diet. One diet to rule them all.\n\nAnd what about drug side effects? I\u2019m not talking a little rash or something. Prescription drugs kill more than 100,000\u00a0Americans every year.\n\nWait a second\u2014106,000 deaths a year? That means that the sixth leading cause of death is actually doctors!\n\nThe sixth leading cause of death\u2026 is me! Thankfully, I can be prevented with a plant-based diet.\n\nSeriously, though, compared to 15,000 American vegetarians, meat-eaters had about twice the odds of being on aspirin, sleeping pills, tranquilizers, antacids, painkillers, blood pressure medications, laxatives (of course), and insulin. So, plant-based diets are great for those that don\u2019t like taking drugs, those that don\u2019t like paying for drugs, and for people\u00a0that don\u2019t like risking drug\u00a0side effects.\n\nWant to solve the healthcare crisis? I\u2019ve got a suggestion.\n\nThere is only one diet that\u2019s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients\u2014a plant-based diet. Anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet, ask them one simple question: \u201cHas it been proven to reverse heart disease? You know, the most likely reason you and everyone you love will die?\u201d If the answer is no, why would you even consider it?\n\nIf that\u2019s all a plant-based diet could do\u2014reverse our #1 killer, then shouldn\u2019t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing, treating, and reversing\u00a0other leading killers would seem to make the case for plant-based eating overwhelming.\n\nMost deaths in the United States are preventable, and related to nutrition. According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published, the #1 cause of death in the United States and the #1 cause of disability is our diet, which has since bumped tobacco smoking to killer #2. Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year\u2014whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more.\n\nSo, let me end with a thought experiment. Imagine yourself a smoker, back in the 1950s. The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4,000 cigarettes a year. Think about that. In the 1950s, the\n\naverage\n\nAmerican smoked a half a pack a day.\n\nThe media was telling you to smoke, and famous athletes agreed. Even Santa Claus. I mean, you want to keep fit and stay slender. So, you make sure to smoke and eat hot dogs to keep trim. And eat lots of sugar to stay slim\n\nand trim\n\n. Sugar is a lot better than that apple there, right? \u00a0I mean, sheesh.\n\nAlthough apples do \u201cconnote goodness and freshness,\u201d reads one internal tobacco industry memo, \u201cwhich brings up many possibilities for making youth-oriented cigarettes.\u201d They want to make apple-flavored cigarettes for children. Shameless!\n\n\u201cFor digestion\u2019s sake, you smoke.\u201d I mean, no curative power is claimed for Philip Morris\u2014but, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, better safe than sorry, and smoke.\n\n\u201cBlow in her face and she\u2019ll follow you anywhere.\u201d \u00a0\u201cNo woman ever says no.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cso round, so firm, so fully packed!\u201d\n\nAfter all, John Wayne smoked them, until he got lung cancer and died.\n\nBack then, even the paleo folks were smoking, and so were the doctors.\n\nThis is not to say there wasn\u2019t controversy within the medical profession. Yes, some doctors smoked Camels, but other doctors\u00a0preferred Luckies. So, there was a little conflict there.\n\nThe leader of the U.S. Senate agreed. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to give their throat a vacation? How could there be a single case of throat irritation, when \u201ccigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink?\u201d (Perhaps in Flint, Michigan!)\n\nAnd if you do get irritated? No problem; your doctor can always write you a prescription for cigarettes. This is an ad in\u00a0the\n\nJournal of the American Medical Association\n\n. So, when mainstream medicine is saying that smoking, on balance, is\u00a0good for you, when the American Medical Association is saying that, where could you turn back then if you just wanted the facts? What\u2019s the new data advanced by science? She was \u201ctoo tired for fun\u2026and then she smoked a Camel.\u201d\n\nBabe Ruth spoke of proof positive medical science\u2014that is, when he still could speak, before he died of throat cancer.\n\nNow if, by some miracle, there was a SmokingFacts.org website back then that could deliver the science directly, bypassing commercially corruptible institutional filters, you would have become aware of studies like this. An Adventist study in California published in 1958, that showed that nonsmokers may have at least 90% lower\u00a0lung cancer risk compared to smokers. But this wasn\u2019t the first.\n\nWhen famed surgeon Michael DeBakey was asked why his studies published back in the 30s linking smoking and lung cancer were simply ignored, he had to remind people about what it was like back then. We were a smoking society. It was in the movies; it was everywhere. Medical meetings were one heavy haze of smoke. Smoking was, in a word, normal.\n\nSo, back to our thought experiment: if you\u2019re a smoker in the 50s in the know, what do you do? \u00a0Do you change, or do you wait? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your smoking habit is probably not good for you. So, do you change your smoking habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between puffs, to quit, you could have cancer by then. If you wait until the powers that be officially recognize it, like the Surgeon General did in the subsequent decade, you could be dead by then.\n\nIt took 25 years for the Surgeon General\u2019s report to come out. It took more than 7,000 studies, and the deaths of countless smokers before the first Surgeon General\u2019s report against smoking was finally released in the 1960s. You\u2019d think, maybe, after the first 6,000 studies, they could have given people a little heads up or something? No, it was a powerful industry.\n\nSo, one wonders how many people are currently suffering needlessly from dietary diseases. Maybe we should have stopped smoking after the\n\n700th\n\nstudy like this came out.\n\nAs a smoker in the 50s, on one hand, you had all of society, the government, the medical profession itself telling you to smoke. And, on the other hand, all you had was the science\u2014if you were even lucky enough to be aware\u00a0of studies like this.\n\nNow fast forward, 55\u00a0years. There\u2019s a new Adventist study out of California, warning America about the risks of something else they may be putting in their mouths. And it\u2019s not just one study. According to the latest review, the total sum of evidence suggests that mortality from all causes put together, and many of our dreaded diseases\u2014heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes\u2014is significantly lower in those eating plant-based.\n\nSo, instead of someone going along with America\u2019s smoking habits in the 50s, imagine you, or someone you know, going along with America\u2019s\n\neating\n\nhabits today. What do you do? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your eating habits are probably not so good for you. So, do you change your eating habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between bites, to change your diet, it may be too late.\n\nIn fact, even after the Surgeon General\u2019s report was released, the medical community still dragged their feet. The AMA actually went on record refusing to endorse the Surgeon General\u2019s report. Why? Could that have been because they had just been handed $10 million from the tobacco industry? Maybe not;\u00a0maybe it\u2019s coincidence.\n\nSo, we know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry\u2014but why weren\u2019t individual doctors speaking out? Well, there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time, writing in, as there are today, standing up against industries killing millions. But why not more? Maybe it\u2019s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes, just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemic of dietary diseases. What was the AMA\u2019s rallying cry back then? Everything in moderation. \u201cExtensive scientific studies have proved that smoking in moderation\u201d is okay. Sound familiar?\n\nToday, the food industry uses the same tobacco industry tactics\u2014supplying misinformation, twisting the science.\n\nThe same scientists-for-hire paid to downplay the risks of secondhand smoke and toxic chemicals are the same paid\u00a0by the National Confectioners Association to downplay the risks of candy, and the same hired by the meat industry to downplay the risks of meat.\n\nConsumption of animal products and processed foods causes at least 14 million deaths around the world every\u00a0year. 14 million people dead every year. Plant-based diets can\u00a0now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking.\n\nHow many more people have to die, though, before the CDC encourages people not to wait for open-heart surgery to start eating healthy as well?\n\nUntil the system changes, we need\u00a0to take personal responsibility for our own health, and for our family\u2019s health. We can\u2019t wait until society catches up to the science, because it\u2019s a matter of life and death.\n\nLast year, Dr. Kim Williams became President of the American College of Cardiology. He was asked why he follows his own advice that he gives to patients, to eat a plant-based diet. \u201cI don\u2019t mind dying,\u201d Dr. Williams replied. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be my own fault.\u201d\n\nThank you very much.\n\nTo see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr.\u00a0Greger may be referring, watch the above video.

This is a picture of me, right around the time that my grandma was diagnosed with end-stage heart disease and sent home to die. She had already had so many bypass operations, basically ran out of plumbing at some point, confined to a wheelchair, and there was nothing more they could do. \u00a0Her life was over at age 65. But then, she heard about this guy, Nathan Pritikin, one of our early lifestyle medicine pioneers.\n\nAnd what happened next is chronicled in Pritikin\u2019s biography. My grandma was one of the \u201cdeath\u2019s door\u201d people. Frances Greger arrived in a wheelchair. \u201cMrs. Greger had heart disease, angina, and claudication; her condition was so bad she could no longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs. \u00a0Within three weeks, though she was not only out of her wheelchair but was walking ten miles a day.\u201d\n\nThis is my grandma at her grandson\u2019s wedding 15 years after she was given her medical death sentence, and thanks to a healthy diet, she was able to live\u00a0another 31 years on this earth\u2014until 96\u2014to enjoy her six grandkids, including me.\n\nThat is why I went into medicine.\n\nWhen Dr. Ornish published his Lifestyle Heart Trial years later, proving with quantitative angiography that coronary artery\u00a0disease could indeed be reversed in the majority of patients without drugs or surgery\u2014just a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle changes, I assumed that it was going to be a game-changer. My family had seen it with their own eyes, but finally here it was in black and white, published in one of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals on the planet. But, nothing happened\u2014 leaving me to wonder if, effectively, the cure to our #1\u00a0killer could get lost down some rabbit hole and ignored, then, what else might be in the medical literature that can help my patients? I made it my life\u2019s mission to find out.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with my work, every year I read through every issue of every English-language nutrition journal in the world\u2014so busy folks like you don\u2019t have to.\n\nI then compile all the most interesting, the most groundbreaking, the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day to\u00a0my nonprofit site, NutritionFacts.org.\n\nEverything on the website is free. There are no ads, no corporate sponsorships. It\u2019s strictly noncommercial, not selling anything. I just put it up as a public service, as a labor of love.\n\nNew videos and articles\n\nevery day\n\n, on the latest in\n\nevidence-based\n\nnutrition. What a concept!\n\nWhere did Pritikin get his evidence from? A network of missionary hospitals set up by Western doctors throughout sub-Saharan Africa uncovered what may be one of the most important advances in health, according to one of our\u00a0most famous medical figures of the 20th century, Dr. Denis Burkitt: the fact that many of the most common and major diseases \u201cin modern Western culture are universally rare in third world communities.\u201d\n\nLike, heart disease. This landmark article from the 50s started out with a shocking statement: \u201cIn the African population of Uganda, coronary heart disease is almost non-existent.\u201d Wait a second, our #1 cause of death, almost nonexistent? What were they eating?\n\nThey were eating a lot of starchy vegetables, starchy grains, and greens, and their protein almost exclusively\u00a0from plant sources, and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it. Actually, very similar to those eating modern-day, plant-based diets.\n\nMaybe the Africans were just dying early from some\u00a0other kind of diseases\u2014and so, never lived long enough to have a heart attack? No, here are\n\nage-matched\n\nheart attack rates in Uganda versus St. Louis. Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda, only one myocardial infarction. Out of 632 age- and gender-matched autopsies in Missouri, 136 myocardial infarctions: more than 100 times the rate of our #1 killer.\n\nIn fact, they were so blown away they went back and did another 800 autopsies in Uganda, and still, just that one small healed infarct (meaning it wasn\u2019t even the cause of death) out of 1,427 patients\u2014less than one in a thousand; whereas here, heart disease is an epidemic.\n\nThis is a list of diseases commonly found in the U.S. (and in populations that eat and live like the U.S.), but are rare or even nonexistent in populations centering their diets around\n\nwhole plant foods\n\n.\n\nThese are among our most\n\ncommon\n\ndiseases, like obesity, for example, or hiatal hernia, one of the most common stomach problems. Varicose veins and hemorrhoids\u2014two of the most common venous problems; colorectal cancer\u2014a leading cause of cancer-related death; diverticulitis\u2014the #1 disease of the intestines; appendicitis\u2014the #1 cause of\u00a0emergency abdominal surgery; gallbladder disease\u2014the #1 cause of\n\nnonemergency\n\nabdominal surgery; as well as\u00a0ischemic heart disease\u2014the\n\ncommonest cause of death\n\nhere, but a rarity among plant-based populations.\n\nThis suggests heart disease may be a\n\nchoice\n\n. Like cavities. If you look at the teeth of people who lived over 10,000 years before the invention of the toothbrush, they pretty much had no cavities. Didn\u2019t brush a day in their lives; no flossing; yet, no cavities. That\u2019s because candy bars hadn\u2019t been invented yet.\n\nWhy do people continue to get cavities when we know they\u2019re preventable through diet? Simple. Because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist\u2019s chair for many people. And, that\u2019s fine!\n\nLook, as long as people understand the consequences of their actions, as a physician, what more can I do? If you\u2019re an adult, and decide the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family, then, go for it\u2014I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence (I\u2019ve got a good dental plan).\n\nBut, what if instead of the plaque on our teeth, we\u2019re talking about the plaque building up inside of our arteries? This is another disease that can be prevented by changing our diet.\n\nNow, what are the consequences for you and your family? Now, we\u2019re not talking about scraping tartar anymore. Now, we\u2019re talking life and death. The most likely reason that most of our loved ones will die is because of heart disease. It\u2019s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live\u2014but we should make these\u00a0choices consciously, educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions.\n\nCoronary heart disease; atherosclerosis; hardening of the arteries, begins in\n\nchildhood\n\n.\n\nBy age 10, the arteries of nearly all kids raised on the standard American diet already have fatty streaks\u2014the first stage of the disease.\n\nThen, these plaques start forming in our 20s, get worse in our 30s, and then, can start killing us off. In our hearts, it\u2019s called a heart attack; in our brains, the same disease is\u00a0called a stroke.\n\nIf there is\n\nanyone\n\nin this audience older than age 10, then the question\u00a0isn\u2019t whether or not to eat healthy to\n\nprevent\n\nheart disease; it\u2019s whether you want to\n\nreverse\n\nthe heart disease that you already have.\n\nIs that even possible? When researchers took people with heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by those populations that didn\u2019t suffer from heart disease, their hope was to slow the disease process down\u2014maybe even stop it. But instead, something miraculous happened.\n\nThe disease started to reverse, to get better. As soon as patients stopped eating an artery-clogging diet, their arteries started opening up. \u00a0Their bodies were able to start dissolving some of the plaque away. Even in some cases of severe triple vessel heart disease, arteries opened up without drugs, without surgery\u2014suggesting their bodies wanted to heal all along, but were just never given the chance. This improvement in blood flow to the heart is after just three weeks of eating healthy.\n\nLet me share with you the best-kept secret in medicine. The best-kept secret in medicine is that sometimes, given the right conditions, our\u00a0body can heal itself.\n\nIf you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get all red, hot, swollen, and inflamed, but will heal naturally if we just stand back and let our body work its magic. But what if we\n\nkept\n\nwhacking it in the same place three times a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) every day? It\u2019d never heal.\n\nYou\u2019d go to your doctor and say, \u201cMy shin hurts.\u201d And the doctor would be like, no problem, whip out their pad, and write you a prescription for painkillers. You\u2019re still whacking your shin three times a day, but it feels so much better with the pain pills on board. Thank heavens for modern medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s like when taking\u00a0nitroglycerine for crushing chest pain. Tremendous relief, but you\u2019re not actually treating the underlying cause of the disease.\n\nOur body wants to come back to health, if we let it. But if we keep re-injuring it three times a day, we may never heal.\n\nIt\u2019s like smoking. One of the most\n\namazing\n\nthings I learned in medical school was that within about 15 years of stopping smoking, our lung cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Our lungs can clear out all that tar, and eventually, it\u2019s almost as if\u00a0we never started smoking at all.\n\nEvery morning of our smoking life, that healing process started until, wham, our first cigarette of the day, re-injuring our lungs with every puff. Just like we can re-injure our arteries with every bite, when all we had to do all along\u2014the miracle cure, was to just stand back, get out of the way, stop re-damaging ourselves, and let our bodies\u2019 natural healing processes bring us back towards health.\n\nSure, you could choose moderation, and hit yourself with a smaller hammer. But why beat yourself up at all?\n\nThe human body is a self-healing machine.\n\nWe\u2019ve known about this for decades.\n\nAmerican Heart Journal\n\n, 1977: cases like Mr. F.W. here; such severe angina he couldn\u2019t even make it to the mailbox, but then started eating healthier, and a few months later, he was climbing mountains, no pain.\n\nThere are some fancy new anti-angina drugs on the market now that cost thousands of dollars a year. But at the highest dose, they can successfully prolong exercise duration, extending the time someone can walk on a treadmill as long as 33\u00a01/2\u00a0seconds.\n\nIt does not look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.\n\nYou see, plant-based diets aren\u2019t just safer and cheaper, but they\u00a0can work\n\nbetter\n\n.\n\nKiller #2\u00a0is cancer. What happens if we put cancer on a plant-based diet? Dean Ornish and colleagues found that the progression of prostate cancer could be reversed with a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle behaviors\u2014and no wonder.\n\nIf you drip the blood of those eating the standard American diet onto cancer cells growing in a petri dish, cancer growth is cut down by about 9%. But put people on a plant-based diet for a year, though, and their blood can do this. The blood circulating within the bodies of those eating\u00a0plant-based diets has nearly eight\u00a0times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth.\n\nNow, this was for prostate cancer\u2014the leading cancer killer specific to men. In women, it\u2019s breast cancer. So, researchers tried duplicating the study with women, using breast cancer cells instead. They didn\u2019t want to wait a whole year to get the results, though. So, they figured they\u2019d see what a healthy diet could do in just two weeks, against three different types of human breast cancer cells.\n\nThis was the before: cancer growth powering away at 100%. And then, after eating a plant-based diet for 14 days.\n\nHere\u2019s the before picture: a layer of breast cancer cells is laid down in a petri dish, and then blood from women eating the standard American diet is dripped on them. And as you can see, even people eating crappy diets have some ability to break down cancer. But after just two\u00a0weeks eating healthy, blood was drawn from those same women\u2014so, they acted as their own controls\u2014dripped on another carpet of breast cancer cells, and this is what they were left with; just a few individual cancer cells left. Their bodies just cleaned up.\n\nBefore, and after; just two weeks eating healthy. Their blood became that much more hostile to cancer.\n\nSlowing down the growth of cancer cells is nice, but getting rid of them is even better. This is what\u2019s called apoptosis, programmed cell death. After eating healthy, their own bodies were able to reprogram the cancer cells, forcing them into early retirement.\n\nThis is what\u2019s called TUNEL imaging, measuring\u00a0DNA fragmentation or cell death. Dying cells show up as white spots. So, again, this is the before\u2014what the blood of the average woman eating a standard American diet can do to breast cancer cells. Her blood may be able to kill off a few. But then, after 14 days of healthy plant-based living, her blood can do this. It\u2019s like she\u2019s an entirely different person inside.\n\nThe same blood that was now coursing through these women\u2019s bodies gained the power to significantly slow down and stop breast cancer cell growth, within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\nof eating a plant-based diet.\n\nWhat kind of blood do we want in our body; what kind of immune system? Do we want blood that just kind of rolls over when new cancer cells pop up, or do we want blood circulating to every nook and cranny of our body with the power to slow down and stop them?\n\nNow, this dramatic strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plant-based diet\n\nand\n\nexercise; they had these women\u00a0out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day. Well, wait a second, if you do two things, how do you know what role the diet played? So, the researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\nThis is measuring cancer cell clearance. This is what we saw before; the effect of blood taken from those who ate a plant-based diet\u2014in this case for an average of 14 years\u2014along with mild exercise, like just walking every day. Plant-based diet and walking\u2014that\u2019s the kind of cancer cell clearance you get. Compare that to the cancer-stopping power of your average sedentary meat-eater, which is basically nonexistent.\n\nThis middle group is interesting, though. Instead of 14 years on a plant-based diet, ate 14 years of a standard American diet\u2014\n\nbut\n\n, had 14 years of daily, strenuous, hour-long exercise, like calisthenics.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know if you exercise long enough, if you exercise hard enough, can you rival some strolling plant-eaters?\n\nAnd the answer is, exercise helped\u2014no question, but literally 5,000 hours in the gym was no match for a plant-based diet.\n\nSame thing as before. Even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes, your body\u2019s not totally defenseless. Your bloodstream can kill off a few cancer cells. But here\u2019s the hard core strenuous exercise group, killing off cancer cells left and right.\n\nBut nothing appears to kick more cancer tush than a plant-based diet.\n\nWe think it\u2019s because of the animal proteins\u2014meat, egg white, and dairy proteins\u2014increasing the level of IGF-1 in our bodies. Insulin-like growth factor-1, a cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in the acquisition and progression of malignant tumors.\n\nBut if we lower animal protein intake, if you put people on a plant-based diet, their IGF-1 levels go down, and if you put people\u00a0on a plant-based diet for years, their levels drop even further.\n\nAnd their IGF-1\n\nbinding protein\n\nlevels go up. That\u2019s one way our body tries to protect itself from cancer\u2014from excessive growth\u2014by releasing a binding protein into our bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF-1. It\u2019s like our body\u2019s emergency brake. Yes, in as little as two\u00a0weeks, a plant-based diet can bring down your liver\u2019s production of IGF-1 . But what about all the IGF-1 circulating in your bloodstream from the bacon and eggs you had three weeks before? So, your liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to take it out of circulation. And, as you can see, it just gets better and better, the longer you eat healthy.\n\nHere\u2019s the experiment that nailed IGF-1 as the villain; same as last time. Go on a plant-based diet, cancer cell growth drops, and cancer cell death shoots up. But then, here\u2019s the kicker: what if you added back to the cancer the exact same amount of IGF-1 banished from your system just\u00a0because you were eating healthy for two weeks? It erases the diet and exercise effect. It\u2019s like you never started eating healthy at all.\n\nSo, the reason the largest prospective study on diet and cancer ever found that the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meat-eaters may be because they eat less animal protein. So, they end up with less IGF-1, which can mean less cancer growth.\n\nHow much less cancer are we talking about? Middle-aged men and women with high protein intakes had a 75% increase in total\u00a0mortality, and a four\n\n\u2013\n\nfold\u00a0increase in the risk of dying from cancer. But not all proteins; specifically animal protein, which makes sense, of course, given the higher IGF-1 levels.\n\nThe academic institution sent out a press release with a memorable opening line: \u201cThat chicken wing you\u2019re eating could be as deadly as a cigarette,\u201d explaining that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer\u2014\u201da mortality risk factor comparable to smoking.\u201d\n\nWhat was the response to the revelation that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking? One nutrition scientist replied that it was potentially dangerous to compare the effects of smoking with the effect of meat and cheese. Why? Because a smoker might think, \u201cWhy bother quitting smoking if my ham\u00a0and cheese\u00a0sandwich is just as bad for me?\u201d So, better not to tell anyone about the whole meat and dairy thing.\n\nThat reminds me of a famous Philip Morris cigarette ad that tried to downplay the risks by saying, \u201cYou think secondhand smoke is bad, increasing the risk of lung cancer 19%? Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of milk every day may be three times as bad\u201462% increased\u00a0risk of lung cancer.\u201d Or doubling the risk by frequently cooking with oil, or tripling your risk of heart disease by eating non-vegetarian, or multiplying your risk six-fold by eating lots of meat and dairy. So, they conclude, \u201cLet\u2019s keep a sense of\n\nperspective\n\nhere.\u201d The risk of lung cancer from secondhand smoke may be \u201cwell below the risk reported for other everyday activities.\u201d So, breathe deep.\n\nThat\u2019s like saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about getting stabbed, because getting shot is so much worse.\u201d\n\nUh, how about neither? Two risks don\u2019t make a right.\n\nYou\u2019ll note Philip Morris stopped throwing dairy under the bus when they purchased Kraft Foods.\n\nOkay, what about the other\u00a013 leading causes of death?\n\nThe top three killers used to be heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Oh, that is\n\nso\n\n2007. Now, it\u2019s heart disease, cancer, and COPD\u2014chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, like emphysema. Thankfully, COPD can be prevented with the help of a plant-based diet, and even treated with plants; improving lung function over time.\n\nOf course, the tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently. Instead of adding plants to one\u2019s\n\ndiet\n\nto help one\u2019s lung function, wouldn\u2019t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes? And indeed, the addition of a\u00e7a\u00ed berries to cigarettes evidently has a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice. Who would have thunk it?\n\nNext, they\u2019re going to be putting berries in meat. And indeed, I couldn\u2019t make this stuff up. The addition of\u00a0fruit extracts to burgers was not without its glitches, though. The blackberries \u201cliterally dyed burger patties with a distinct purplish colour\u201d\u2014though, evidently, infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in does evidently improve tenderness. And, it\u2019s even possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurters with powdered grape seeds, though, there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product. And if there\u2019s one thing we know about hot dog-eaters, it\u2019s that they\u2019re picky about what goes in their food.\n\nPig anus? Okay, but grape seeds? Eww!\n\nStrokes are killer #4. Preventing strokes may be all about eating potassium-rich foods, yet most Americans don\u2019t even reach the recommended\n\nminimum\n\ndaily intake. And by most, I mean more than 98%. 98% of us eat potassium-deficient diets, because 98% of us don\u2019t eat enough plants.\n\nPotassium comes from the words pot ash. You take any plant, put it in a pot, and reduce it to ash, and you\u2019re left with pot-ash-ium, so-called vegetable alkali. True story, but can anyone name me a plant food particularly high in potassium?\n\nBananas, right? I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s like the one thing everyone knows about nutrition. Chiquita must have had a great PR firm or something. But it turns out that bananas don\u2019t even make the top 50 sources, coming in at number 86, right behind fast food vanilla milk shakes. It goes fast food vanilla milk shakes,\n\nthen\n\nbananas.\n\nIn fact, when I was researching for my new book, I found out that the USDA expanded their list, and now bananas don\u2019t even make the top\n\nthousand\n\nsources\n\n;\n\ncoming in at number 1,611, right after Reese\u2019s Pieces. I kid you not. The most concentrated whole food sources of potassium in the diet are: beans, and greens, and dates.\n\nBananas don\u2019t make it to a thousand\u2014in fact, if you look at the next leading cause of death (unintentional injuries), bananas could be downright dangerous.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is now our sixth leading killer, now striking\u00a0a staggering four\u00a0million Americans affected. Twenty\u00a0years ago, it wasn\u2019t even in the top ten. According to the latest dietary guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s, the two most important things we can do: cut down our consumption of meat, dairy, and junk; and replace those\u00a0with vegetables, beans, fruits, and whole grains.\n\nThis is based, in part, on data going back over 20\u00a0years now. Those who eat meat\u2014red meat or white meat, it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014appear between two\u00a0to three\u00a0times more likely to become demented later in life, compared to those that don\u2019t eat meat. And the longer one eats meat-free, the lower the risk of dementia drops.\n\nNext on the list: type 2 diabetes, which we can prevent, arrest, and reverse with a plant-based diet\u2014something we\u2019ve known since back in the 1930s. Within five\u00a0years, about a quarter of the diabetics were able to get off insulin.\n\nBut plant-based diets are low-calorie diets. Maybe their diabetes just got better because they lost so much weight? To tease that out, what we would need is a study where researchers switch people to a healthy diet, but force them to eat so much food that they wouldn\u2019t\u00a0lose any weight, despite eating healthier. Then, we could see if plant-based diet had unique benefits beyond all the weight loss. We\u2019d have to wait 44 years, but here it is: subjects were weighed every day, and if they started losing weight, they were made to eat more food. In fact, so much food, some of the participants had problems\u00a0eating it all\u2014like \u201cnot another tostada, not another salad.\u201d But they eventually adapted; so, there was no significant alteration in body weight, despite restricting meat, dairy, eggs, and junk.\n\nSo, with zero weight loss, did a plant-based diet still help? Overall, insulin requirements were cut about 60%, and half were able to get off insulin altogether despite no change in weight. How many years did this\u00a0take? No, 16\n\ndays\n\n.\n\nSo, we\u2019re talking diabetics who\u2019ve had diabetes for as long as 20\u00a0years, injecting 20 units of insulin a day. And then, as few as 13 days later, they\u2019re off of all insulin altogether, thanks to less than two weeks on a plant-based diet\u2014even with zero weight loss. Diabetes for 20 years, then off all insulin in two\u00a0weeks. Diabetes for 20 years, because no one had told them about a plant-based diet. Here\u2019s patient 15; 32 units of insulin on the control diet, and then, 18 days later, on none. Lower blood sugars on 32 units\n\nless\n\ninsulin. That\u2019s the power of plants. This was without weight loss; his body just started working that much better.\n\nAnd as a bonus, their cholesterol dropped like a rock to under 150, in just 16 days. Just like moderate changes in diet usually result in only modest reductions in cholesterol, how moderate do you want your diabetes?\n\nEverything in moderation may be a truer statement than many people realize. Moderate changes in diet can leave diabetics with moderate vision loss, moderate kidney failure, and moderate amputations\u2014maybe just a few\u00a0toes or something? Moderation in all things is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nThat study that purported to show that diets high in meat, eggs, and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking supposedly suggested that people who eat lots of animal protein are four times as likely to die from cancer or diabetes. But if you look at the actual study, you\u2019ll see that\u2019s not true. Those eating lots of animal protein didn\u2019t have just four\u00a0times more risk of dying from diabetes;\n\nthey had 73 times higher risk of dying from diabetes.\n\nThose who chose moderation\u2014eating a moderate amount of animal protein\u2014only had 23 times the risk of death from diabetes.\n\nKiller #8 is kidney failure, which may be both prevented and treated with a plant-based diet. And no surprise; kidneys are highly vascular organs. Harvard researchers found three dietary risk factors for declining kidney function: animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol. Animal fat can alter the actual structure of our kidneys, based on studies like this, showing plugs of fat literally clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys.\n\nAnd the animal\n\nprotein\n\ncan have a profound effect on normal kidney function, inducing what\u2019s called hyperfiltration; increasing the workload on the kidney, but not plant protein. Eat some\u00a0tuna fish, and you can see increased pressure on the kidneys one, two, and three\u00a0hours after the meal; shoots right up. If, instead of having a tuna salad sandwich, though, you\u00a0had a\n\ntofu\n\nsalad sandwich with the same amount of protein, no effect. Kidneys can deal with plant protein\u00a0without even batting an eyelash.\n\nWhy does\n\nanimal\n\nprotein cause the overload reaction, but not plant protein? It appears to be due to inflammation triggered by the animal protein. We know this because if you give a powerful anti-inflammatory drug along with the tuna fish, you can actually abolish that hyperfiltration effect, that protein leakage effect in response to meat ingestion.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the acid load. Animal protein induces the formation of acid within the kidney, which may lead to tubular toxicity: damage to the delicate urine-making tubes within the kidney. Animal foods tend to be acid-forming, whereas plant foods tend to either be relatively neutral or actually alkaline,\n\nbase\n\n-forming, to counteract some of that acid. So, the solution to halting the progression of chronic kidney disease might lie\u00a0in the produce aisle\u00a0rather than the pharmacy aisle.\n\nNo wonder plant-based diets have been used to\n\ntreat\n\nkidney disease for decades. Here\u2019s protein leakage on the low-sodium diet that physicians would conventionally put these patients on; switched to a supplemented vegan diet; conventional; plant-based; conventional; plant-based\u2014turning kidney dysfunction on and off like a light switch, based on what\u2019s going into their mouths.\n\nKiller #9 is respiratory infections. What possible role could diet play? You obviously haven\u2019t seen my video\n\nKale and the Immune System\n\n, talking about the immunostimulatory effects of kale. Is there anything kale cannot do?\n\nBoosting antibody production seven-fold; but that\u2019s in a petri dish. What about in people? Older men and women were split into two groups right before they were going to get their Pneumovax vaccination (their pneumonia vaccination). Half continued to eat as they always had. The other half added just a few servings of fruits and vegetables to their daily diet, and after getting their injection, you can see a significant improvement in the protective antibody immune response from that one simple change. That wasn\u2019t cutting out meat; just adding fruits and vegetables can significantly improve immune function.\n\nKiller #10 is suicide. We\u2019ve known those eating healthier have healthier mood states\u2014in fact, only about half the depression, anxiety, and stress scores compared to those that eat meat. Researchers suspect it\u2019s the arachidonic acid, this\u00a0inflammatory long chain omega-6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs. That\u2019s where it\u2019s predominantly found in the American diet. But you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s cause and effect, until you put it to the test.\n\nThey took people eating the standard American diet, and removed meat, fish, poultry, and eggs from their diets, and got a significant improvement in mood scores within\u00a0just\n\ntwo weeks\n\n. Thanks, perhaps, to the removal of arachidonic acid from their bodies, which they thought may be adversely impacting mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation; brain inflammation, but we\u00a0could bring that down\u00a0within a matter of weeks after cutting eggs, chicken, and other meat.\n\nNow, am I just cherry picking, though? What about all the randomized controlled trials like that, showing that\n\nother\n\ndiets have improved mood?\n\nThere aren\u2019t any.\n\nA recent review concluded that\n\nonly\n\nthe plant-based study fit the bill. It\u2019s hard to cherry pick when there\u2019s only one cherry.\n\nWorks in a workplace setting too: significant increases in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health\u2014not surprisingly, translating into improved work productivity. The biggest such study, across 15 corporate sites at Geico, found that plant-based diets resulted in significant reported improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, and emotional well-being. So, lifestyle interventions, such as exercise, can help\n\nmental\n\nas well as physical health. And among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets.\n\nKiller #11 is blood infections. Sure, foodborne bacteria can kind of burrow through the bloodstream and directly invade through the intestinal wall\u2014but in women, may creep up into their bladder.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for decades that it\u2019s bacteria creeping up from the rectum that cause bladder infections. But only recently did we figure out where that rectal reservoir of bladder-infecting\n\nE. coli\n\nwas coming from: chicken. We now have DNA fingerprinting proof of a direct link between farm animals, meat, and bladder infections\u2014solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis, bladder infections as an animal-to-human disease.\n\nWait a second. Can\u2019t I\u00a0just use a meat thermometer and cook the meat through? No, because of cross-contamination. We\u2019ve known for decades that if you give someone a frozen chicken to prepare and cook in their own kitchen as they normally would, a multitude of antibiotic-resistant\n\nE. coli\n\njump from the chicken into the gut of the volunteer \u2014before they even eat it! So, you could incinerate it to ash; you don\u2019t even have to eat any of it. And it still wouldn\u2019t matter, because you already infected yourself just handling it.\n\nWithin days, the drug-resistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person\u2019s gut flora. The chicken bacteria were like taking over their intestines.\n\nEven if you follow all the safe handling guidelines, rinsing everything with bleach\u2014even spraying bleach on for good measure, there still may be pathogenic fecal bacteria left behind. No one actually does this, but what if you did this, and then came in later and swabbed kitchen surfaces? Researchers found pathogenic fecal bacteria: salmonella, campylobacter\u2014both serious human pathogens, still left behind in the kitchen. The reason that most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen sink than on their toilet seat is because most people rinse chickens in the sink, not the toilet. So, unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab, the only way to guarantee we\u2019re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into our homes in the first place.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s not like you eat chicken once, and you\u2019re colonized for life. In this study, the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about ten\u00a0days before our good bacteria were able to muscle them out of the way. The problem is that most families eat chicken more than once every ten days; so, they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems.\n\nBut wait a second. You can\u2019t sell unsafe cars; you can\u2019t sell unsafe toys; how is it legal to sell unsafe meat?\n\nThey do it by blaming the consumer. As one USDA poultry microbiologist said: \u201cRaw meats are not idiot-proof. They can be mishandled and when they are, it\u2019s like handling a hand grenade. If you pull the pin, somebody\u2019s going to get hurt.\u201d See, if we get sick, it\u2019s our fault.\n\nWhile some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in supermarkets, the USDA poultry expert disagrees. \u201cI think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it.\u201d That\u2019s like a car company saying yeah, we installed faulty brakes, but it\u2019s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt.\n\nThe head of the CDC\u2019s food poisoning division responded famously to this kind of blame-the-victim attitude coming from the meat industry. \u201cIs it reasonable that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger, their three-year-old dies?\u201d Is that reasonable?\n\nNot to worry, though: the meat industry is on it. They got the FDA approval for a bacteria-eating virus to spray on the meat. Now, the industry is concerned that consumer acceptance of bacteria-eating viruses may present something of a challenge to the food industry. But if they think that\u2019s going to be a challenge, check out their other bright idea.\n\nThe \u201cEffect of Extracted Housefly Pupae Peptide Mixture on Chilled Pork Preservation\u201d\u2014this is a science-y way of saying they want to smear a maggot mixture on meat.\n\nNow wait\u2014it\u2019s a low-cost and simple method. Think about it; maggots thrive on rotting meat. However, there have been no reports that maggots have any serious diseases; so, they must be packed with some sort of antibacterial something. Have you ever seen a maggot sneeze? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\nSo, they took maggots at three\u00a0days old, washed them, toweled them off, a little Vitamix action, and voil\u00e0! Safer meat.\n\nWe did kidney failure; what about liver failure? We\u2019ve known for decades that a plant-based diet could be used to treat liver failure, significantly reducing the toxins that would otherwise build up eating meat, without a fully functional liver to detoxify your blood.\n\nI do have to admit, though, that some people on plant-based diets have\n\nworsening\n\nliver function. They\u2019re called alcoholics.\u00a0Living on potatoes, corn, grapes, and barley\u2014in fact,\n\nstrictly\n\nplant-based, yet still not doing so hot.\n\nHigh blood pressure is next, affecting nearly 78 million Americans. That\u2019s one in three of us. And as we age, our pressures get higher and higher, such that by age 60, it strikes more than half.\n\nWait a second. If it affects most of us when we get older, maybe it\u2019s less a disease, and more just an inevitable consequence of aging? No. We\u2019ve known since the 1920s that high blood pressure need not occur.\n\nResearchers measured the blood pressures of a thousand people in rural Kenya who ate a diet centered around whole plant foods. Starchy vegetables, whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafies. Our pressures go up as we age; their pressures actually go down.\n\nAnd, the lower the better. The whole 140 over 90 cut-off is arbitrary. \u00a0Even people who start out with blood pressure under 120 over 80 appear to benefit from blood pressure reduction. So, the ideal blood pressure, the no-benefit-from-reducing-it-further blood pressure, is actually 110 over 70. But is it even possible to get blood pressures down to 110 over 70? It\u2019s not just possible; it\u2019s normal\u2014for those eating healthy enough diets.\n\nOver two years at a rural Kenyan hospital, 1,800 patients were admitted. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. Wow! So, they must have had low rates of heart disease. No, they had no rates of heart disease. Not a single case of arteriosclerosis, our #1 killer, was found.\n\nRural China too; about 110 over 70 their entire lives. 70-year-olds had the same average blood pressure as 16-year-olds. Now, of course, Africa and China have vastly different diets, but they share this common theme, that they are plant-based day-to-day, with meat only eaten on special occasions.\n\nWhy do we think it\u2019s the plant-based nature of their diets that was so protective? Because in the Western world, as the American Heart Association has pointed out, the only folks really getting down that low are those eating\u00a0strictly plant-based diets, coming in at an average of\u00a0110 over 65.\n\nBased on the largest study of those eating plant-based diets to date\u201489,000 Californians\u2014there appears to be a stepwise drop in blood pressure\u00a0rates as people eat more and more plant-based.\n\nSame thing with diabetes and obesity. The more and more healthy we eat, the better. Yes, you can wipe out most of your risk eating strictly plant-based, but it\u2019s not black and white, all or nothing. Any movement along the spectrum towards healthier eating can accrue significant benefits.\n\nYou can show this experimentally. You take vegetarians and give them meat, pay them enough to eat it, and their blood pressures go up. Or, you remove meat from their diet, and their blood pressures go down\u2014in just seven\u00a0days! And this is after the vast majority reduced or stopped their blood pressure medications completely. They had to reduce their medications because their pressures were getting so low that if they were on drugs, they could fall over and crack their heads open! \u00a0Lower pressures on fewer drugs; that\u2019s the power of plants.\n\nSo, does the American Heart Association recommend a no-meat diet? No, they recommend a low-meat diet, the so-called DASH diet. Why not vegetarian? When the DASH diet was created, were they just not aware of this landmark research, done by Harvard\u2019s Frank Sacks? No, they were aware of the landmark research. The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Frank Sacks.\n\nSee, the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the #1 goal of capturing the blood pressure-lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet, yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public. They didn\u2019t think the public could handle the truth.\n\nIn their defense, you can see what they were thinking. Just like drugs\n\nnever work\n\nunless you actually take them, diets never work unless you actually eat them. So, you can\u2019t tell people to eat plant-based\u2014they won\u2019t do it. So, they figured they might help more on a population scale if they just soft-pedaled the truth\u00a0to make it more acceptable. Alright,\u00a0tell that to the thousand families\n\na day\n\nthat lose a loved one to high blood pressure. Maybe it\u2019s time to tell the American public the truth.\n\nKiller #14 is Parkinson\u2019s disease. Does a plant-based diet reduce risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease? Well, most studies to date do suggest a link between dairy products and Parkinson\u2019s\u2014but why?\n\nWell, there\u2019s evidence that milk is contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals. High levels of pesticide residues are found in the milk supply, and in the brains of people who die from Parkinson\u2019s disease. And there are other pollutants, like tetrahydroisoquiniline, which is actually what scientists use to try to induce Parkinson\u2019s in primates\u2014and which is found mostly in cheese. So, maybe the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of the milk supply. Good luck with that.\n\nYou could always just not drink it, but then, what would happen to your bones? That\u2019s a marketing ploy; if you look at the actual science, milk does\n\nnot\n\nappear to protect against hip fracture risk, whether drinking during your adult years, or drinking milk during your teen years. If anything, milk consumption was associated with an\n\nincrease\n\nin fracture risk. \u00a0Maybe this is why hip fracture rates are\n\nhighest\n\nin populations with the greatest milk consumption, where they drink the most milk. Swedish researchers decided to put it to the test.\n\n100,000\u00a0men and women followed for up to 20 years, and milk-drinking women had higher rates of death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer, for each daily glass of milk. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of premature death.\n\nAnd they had significantly more bone and hip fractures, too. More milk, more fractures. Milk-drinking men also had higher rates of death. But for some reason, you never see milk ads like this [image of milk carton among gravestones].\n\nFinally, aspiration pneumonia, which is caused by swallowing problems due to Parkinson\u2019s, or Alzheimer\u2019s, or a stroke\u2014all of which we\u2019ve already covered.\n\nSo, where does this leave us? These are the top fifteen reasons that Americans die, and a plant-based diet can help prevent nearly all of them; can help treat more than half of them; and, even, in some cases, even reverse the progression of disease, including our top three killers.\n\nThere are drugs that, in some circumstances, can help, too. You can take one drug to treat cholesterol every day for the rest of your life; another drug for blood sugars; a couple different pills for high blood pressure.\n\nThe\n\nsame\n\ndiet, though, does it all! It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a liver-healthy diet, and a\u00a0heart-healthy diet and a different brain-healthy diet. No, a liver-healthy diet is a heart-healthy diet, is a brain-healthy diet. One diet to rule them all.\n\nAnd what about drug side effects? I\u2019m not talking a little rash or something. Prescription drugs kill more than 100,000\u00a0Americans every year.\n\nWait a second\u2014106,000 deaths a year? That means that the sixth leading cause of death is actually doctors!\n\nThe sixth leading cause of death\u2026 is me! Thankfully, I can be prevented with a plant-based diet.\n\nSeriously, though, compared to 15,000 American vegetarians, meat-eaters had about twice the odds of being on aspirin, sleeping pills, tranquilizers, antacids, painkillers, blood pressure medications, laxatives (of course), and insulin. So, plant-based diets are great for those that don\u2019t like taking drugs, those that don\u2019t like paying for drugs, and for people\u00a0that don\u2019t like risking drug\u00a0side effects.\n\nWant to solve the healthcare crisis? I\u2019ve got a suggestion.\n\nThere is only one diet that\u2019s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients\u2014a plant-based diet. Anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet, ask them one simple question: \u201cHas it been proven to reverse heart disease? You know, the most likely reason you and everyone you love will die?\u201d If the answer is no, why would you even consider it?\n\nIf that\u2019s all a plant-based diet could do\u2014reverse our #1 killer, then shouldn\u2019t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing, treating, and reversing\u00a0other leading killers would seem to make the case for plant-based eating overwhelming.\n\nMost deaths in the United States are preventable, and related to nutrition. According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published, the #1 cause of death in the United States and the #1 cause of disability is our diet, which has since bumped tobacco smoking to killer #2. Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year\u2014whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more.\n\nSo, let me end with a thought experiment. Imagine yourself a smoker, back in the 1950s. The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4,000 cigarettes a year. Think about that. In the 1950s, the\n\naverage\n\nAmerican smoked a half a pack a day.\n\nThe media was telling you to smoke, and famous athletes agreed. Even Santa Claus. I mean, you want to keep fit and stay slender. So, you make sure to smoke and eat hot dogs to keep trim. And eat lots of sugar to stay slim\n\nand trim\n\n. Sugar is a lot better than that apple there, right? \u00a0I mean, sheesh.\n\nAlthough apples do \u201cconnote goodness and freshness,\u201d reads one internal tobacco industry memo, \u201cwhich brings up many possibilities for making youth-oriented cigarettes.\u201d They want to make apple-flavored cigarettes for children. Shameless!\n\n\u201cFor digestion\u2019s sake, you smoke.\u201d I mean, no curative power is claimed for Philip Morris\u2014but, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, better safe than sorry, and smoke.\n\n\u201cBlow in her face and she\u2019ll follow you anywhere.\u201d \u00a0\u201cNo woman ever says no.\u201d They\u2019re \u201cso round, so firm, so fully packed!\u201d\n\nAfter all, John Wayne smoked them, until he got lung cancer and died.\n\nBack then, even the paleo folks were smoking, and so were the doctors.\n\nThis is not to say there wasn\u2019t controversy within the medical profession. Yes, some doctors smoked Camels, but other doctors\u00a0preferred Luckies. So, there was a little conflict there.\n\nThe leader of the U.S. Senate agreed. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want to give their throat a vacation? How could there be a single case of throat irritation, when \u201ccigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink?\u201d (Perhaps in Flint, Michigan!)\n\nAnd if you do get irritated? No problem; your doctor can always write you a prescription for cigarettes. This is an ad in\u00a0the\n\nJournal of the American Medical Association\n\n. So, when mainstream medicine is saying that smoking, on balance, is\u00a0good for you, when the American Medical Association is saying that, where could you turn back then if you just wanted the facts? What\u2019s the new data advanced by science? She was \u201ctoo tired for fun\u2026and then she smoked a Camel.\u201d\n\nBabe Ruth spoke of proof positive medical science\u2014that is, when he still could speak, before he died of throat cancer.\n\nNow if, by some miracle, there was a SmokingFacts.org website back then that could deliver the science directly, bypassing commercially corruptible institutional filters, you would have become aware of studies like this. An Adventist study in California published in 1958, that showed that nonsmokers may have at least 90% lower\u00a0lung cancer risk compared to smokers. But this wasn\u2019t the first.\n\nWhen famed surgeon Michael DeBakey was asked why his studies published back in the 30s linking smoking and lung cancer were simply ignored, he had to remind people about what it was like back then. We were a smoking society. It was in the movies; it was everywhere. Medical meetings were one heavy haze of smoke. Smoking was, in a word, normal.\n\nSo, back to our thought experiment: if you\u2019re a smoker in the 50s in the know, what do you do? \u00a0Do you change, or do you wait? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your smoking habit is probably not good for you. So, do you change your smoking habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between puffs, to quit, you could have cancer by then. If you wait until the powers that be officially recognize it, like the Surgeon General did in the subsequent decade, you could be dead by then.\n\nIt took 25 years for the Surgeon General\u2019s report to come out. It took more than 7,000 studies, and the deaths of countless smokers before the first Surgeon General\u2019s report against smoking was finally released in the 1960s. You\u2019d think, maybe, after the first 6,000 studies, they could have given people a little heads up or something? No, it was a powerful industry.\n\nSo, one wonders how many people are currently suffering needlessly from dietary diseases. Maybe we should have stopped smoking after the\n\n700th\n\nstudy like this came out.\n\nAs a smoker in the 50s, on one hand, you had all of society, the government, the medical profession itself telling you to smoke. And, on the other hand, all you had was the science\u2014if you were even lucky enough to be aware\u00a0of studies like this.\n\nNow fast forward, 55\u00a0years. There\u2019s a new Adventist study out of California, warning America about the risks of something else they may be putting in their mouths. And it\u2019s not just one study. According to the latest review, the total sum of evidence suggests that mortality from all causes put together, and many of our dreaded diseases\u2014heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes\u2014is significantly lower in those eating plant-based.\n\nSo, instead of someone going along with America\u2019s smoking habits in the 50s, imagine you, or someone you know, going along with America\u2019s\n\neating\n\nhabits today. What do you do? With access to the science, you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your eating habits are probably not so good for you. So, do you change your eating habits, or do you wait? If you wait until your physician tells you, between bites, to change your diet, it may be too late.\n\nIn fact, even after the Surgeon General\u2019s report was released, the medical community still dragged their feet. The AMA actually went on record refusing to endorse the Surgeon General\u2019s report. Why? Could that have been because they had just been handed $10 million from the tobacco industry? Maybe not;\u00a0maybe it\u2019s coincidence.\n\nSo, we know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry\u2014but why weren\u2019t individual doctors speaking out? Well, there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time, writing in, as there are today, standing up against industries killing millions. But why not more? Maybe it\u2019s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes, just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemic of dietary diseases. What was the AMA\u2019s rallying cry back then? Everything in moderation. \u201cExtensive scientific studies have proved that smoking in moderation\u201d is okay. Sound familiar?\n\nToday, the food industry uses the same tobacco industry tactics\u2014supplying misinformation, twisting the science.\n\nThe same scientists-for-hire paid to downplay the risks of secondhand smoke and toxic chemicals are the same paid\u00a0by the National Confectioners Association to downplay the risks of candy, and the same hired by the meat industry to downplay the risks of meat.\n\nConsumption of animal products and processed foods causes at least 14 million deaths around the world every\u00a0year. 14 million people dead every year. Plant-based diets can\u00a0now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking.\n\nHow many more people have to die, though, before the CDC encourages people not to wait for open-heart surgery to start eating healthy as well?\n\nUntil the system changes, we need\u00a0to take personal responsibility for our own health, and for our family\u2019s health. We can\u2019t wait until society catches up to the science, because it\u2019s a matter of life and death.\n\nLast year, Dr. Kim Williams became President of the American College of Cardiology. He was asked why he follows his own advice that he gives to patients, to eat a plant-based diet. \u201cI don\u2019t mind dying,\u201d Dr. Williams replied. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be my own fault.\u201d\n\nThank you very much.\n\nTo see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr.\u00a0Greger may be referring, watch the above video.
