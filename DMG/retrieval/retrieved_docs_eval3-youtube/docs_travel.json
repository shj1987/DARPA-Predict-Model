But it will take you more than that to take it from Djibouti to Addis Ababa. It will now take us one day or more,\" he said.\n\nAt the opening ceremony on Wednesday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said that the rail line would be a boost to the economy.\n\n\"It will provide huge benefits to the industrial parks and modern farms that will be built in the future,\" he said.\n\nimage caption\n\nIn a test run on Wednesday, invited guests were taken on a short ride of one of the trains\n\nA businessman at the opening told the BBC that the railway \"would transform\" his trade in transporting livestock.\n\n\"It will be easier, more efficient,\" he said.\n\nThe railway was 70% financed by China's Exim Bank and built by China Railway Group and China Civil Engineering Construction.\n\nChinese controllers, technicians and station masters are among those staffing the services for the next five year after which Ethiopians will be employed.\n\nMr Getachew told the AFP news agency that their local counterparts are in training.\n\nimage copyright\n\nAFP\n\nimage caption\n\nChinese staff are contracted to manage the trains for five years\n\nimage copyright\n\nAFP\n\nimage caption\n\nLocal counterparts will be trained during that time\n\nDjibouti is important to landlocked Ethiopia which currently imports and exports nearly 90% of its goods through its port.\n\nBefore construction was completed freight services transported food to areas affected by drought last year.\n\nimage copyright\n\nAFP\n\nimage caption\n\nThe rail line starts off with freight services\n\nThe railway is the first step in a vast 5,000km-long network of rail which Ethiopia hopes to build by 2020, connecting it to Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan.\n\nThe dream is that one day\n\nthe railway will extend from Djibouti's coast all the way across Africa to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nimage copyright\n\nReuters\n\nimage caption\n\nThe trains go through Adama train station in the Oromia region of Ethiopia\n\nRelated Topics\n\nDjibouti\n\nRail travel\n\nEngineering\n\nInfrastructure\n\nEthiopia\n\nMore on this story\n\nCan Ethiopia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s railway bring peace to Somalia?\n\nPublished\n\n23 November 2015\n\nIs Ethiopia's building boom masking poverty?\n\nPublished\n\n16 April 2015\n\nEthiopia country profile\n\nPublished\n\n5 November 2020\n\nDjibouti profile\n\nPublished\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAround the BBC\n\nAfrica Today podcasts\n\nTop Stories\n\nDozens killed as train crashes in Taiwan tunnel\n\nAt least 48 people are dead and scores more injured in the island's worst rail disaster in decades.\n\nPublished\n\n18 minutes ago\n\nFloyd 'had no pulse' when paramedics arrived\n\nPublished\n\n12 hours ago\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy' Video\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy'\n\nPublished\n\n13 hours ago\n\nFeatures\n\nCelebrity rush exposes Australian 'double standard'\n\nThen and now: Rising temperatures threaten corals\n\nWeekly quiz: TV bust-ups and 'Satan Shoes'\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy' Video\n\n'I discovered my father was a spy'\n\nWorld's deepest-known shipwreck finally seen\n\n'The China media war that pushed me out\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nRiz Ahmed: 'Listening is not just with your ears'\n\nFive takeaways from Biden's White House cabinet\n\nThe pain of being alone behind bars\u00c2\n\nElsewhere on the BBC\n\nFootball phrases\n\n15 sayings from around the world\n\nMost Read\n\nMan beaten up by 'furious octopus' in Australia\n\n1\n\nCelebrity rush exposes Australian 'double standard'\n\n2\n\nYouTuber admits to messaging with 16-year-olds\n\n3\n\nDozens killed as train crashes in Taiwan tunnel\n\n4\n\nSub dives to deepest-known shipwreck\n\n5\n\nTrump sanctions on Italian restaurant were mistake\n\n6\n\nNike wins lawsuit to halt sale of 'Satan Shoes'\n\n7\n\nMore countries added to England's travel ban list\n\n8\n\nStock markets hit new records on Biden spending plan\n\n9\n\nCricket legend Tendulkar in hospital with Covid-19\n\n10\n\nBBC News Services\n\nOn your mobile\n\nOn smart speakers\n\nGet news alerts\n\nContact BBC News\n\nHome\n\nNews\n\nSport\n\nReel\n\nWorklife\n\nTravel\n\nFuture\n\nCulture\n\nMusic\n\nTV\n\nWeather\n\nSounds\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout the BBC\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies\n\nAccessibility Help\n\nParental Guidance\n\nContact the BBC\n\nGet Personalised Newsletters\n\nWhy you can trust the BBC\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info\n\n\u00c2\u00a9 2021 BBC.

He believed Bitcoin would one day change the world and replace the dollar.\n\nBut now he sees a new force emerging - a payment system created by the Chinese state and known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP).\n\nIt's really a digital version of China's official currency, the yuan, and Mr Guo feels DCEP will become the dominant global currency. \"One day everyone in the world will be using DCEP,\" he says.\n\n\"DCEP will be successful because there are a lot of Chinese people living outside of China - there are 39 million Chinese living outside of the country.\n\n\"If they have a connection with China they will use the DCEP. They can make DCEP become an international currency.\"\n\nBut many question whether it will succeed and there are concerns that it will be used by Beijing to spy on citizens.\n\nmedia caption\n\nBitcoin explained: How do crypto-currencies work?\n\nLike Bitcoin, DCEP\n\nutilises a blockchain technology\n\n, a type of digitised ledger used to verify transactions.\n\nBlockchain acts as a universal record of every transaction ever made on that network, and users collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur.\n\nIn practice, that means users don't need a bank if, for example, they want to pay each other, perhaps with their phones.\n\nChina plans to launch DCEP later this year. But so far, the People's Bank of China has not given an exact date for the nationwide launch.\n\nChina began testing the digital currency earlier this year in selected cities. When rolled out it will allow users to link downloaded electronic wallets to their bank cards, make transactions and transfer money.\n\nimage copyright\n\nGetty Images\n\nimage caption\n\nThe new digital yuan will be controlled by the People's Bank of China\n\n\"It's hard to predict the timeline but the People's Bank of China is under a lot of pressure to accelerate the development because they do not want to be in a world where Libra\n\n(Facebook's digital currency)\n\nbecomes the global currency, which they think is worse than the current global financial system controlled by the US,\" says Linghao Bao, an analyst from Beijing-based Trivium.\n\nObservers say China wants to internationalise the yuan so that it can compete with the dollar.\n\n\"The Chinese government believes that if some other countries can also use the Chinese currency it can break the United States' monetary sovereignty. The United States has built the current global financial system and the instruments,\" says an anonymous Chinese cryptocurrency observer known as Bitfool.\n\nThe technology enthusiast worked in the venture capital sector before joining a number of Chinese internet companies. He started researching Bitcoin and believes that digital currencies represent the future of money.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\n'Lack of investment' behind delayed court cases\n\nHow photographers track down stolen pictures\n\nWhen changing a light bulb is a really big deal\n\nFans face closer tracking when stadiums reopen\n\nCan artificial intelligence create a decent dinner?\n\n\"Some traditional banking systems can't serve a poor country. In the traditional system, if you only have $10 a bank can't make money from you, but with digital currency, everyone has the right to enter. The threshold to enter is really low,\" he says.\n\nAlthough Facebook has\n\nscaled back its plans for Libra\n\n, it was still a concern for China. The social media giant plans to roll out an e-wallet known as Novi later this year. It will work as a standalone app but can also be available on Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\n\"The two sides are definitely involved in financial warfare even though no large confrontation has happened yet,\" says Linghao Bao.\n\nObservers like Bitfool believe that China is already further ahead of the US in the battle for the future of money.\n\nChina's digital payment systems are widely seen as the most advanced in the world.\n\nThe country is on the verge of becoming a cashless society. In 2019, four out of every five payments in China were made through either Tencent's WeChat Pay or Alibaba's Alipay.\n\nimage copyright\n\nGetty Images\n\nimage caption\n\nThe new currency could be big if Chinese communities outside China adopt it\n\n\"America is the leader of the global financial system. But they don't have the motivation like China to make the change [to a digital currency],\" says Bitfool.\n\n\"China wants to share that power. But for America, Libra is just a backup plan.\n\n\"In poor countries and also in China there are a lot of people who live in villages. They have very little money but they are using smartphones. If you can buy a smartphone you can use DCEP.\"\n\nHowever, DCEP will be centralised and state-run, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum which are free of state control.\n\nimage copyright\n\nChandler Guo\n\nimage caption\n\nTo create a significant amount of cryptocurrency you need a lot of computing power\n\nMany Bitcoin enthusiasts fear that DCEP will be used as a tool by the Chinese Communist Party to exert greater control over their citizens through surveillance. The authorities will be able to monitor how money is spent in real time. They will also have the same controls over DCEP as with the yuan.\n\nThe yuan is tightly controlled by Beijing and its exchange rate is the source of much tension between the US and China. The US accuses China of\n\nkeeping the yuan weak to benefit its economy.\n\n\"DCEP is the antithesis of Bitcoin. The ultimate goal of a cryptocurrency is the separation of money and state,\" says Stewart Mackenzie, a cryptocurrency expert based in Hong Kong. \"It's easy for them to say that it's like Bitcoin when it's worlds apart.\"\n\nLinghao Bao agrees. \"DCEP is built on an idea of centralised control. The value of Bitcoin lies in its decentralisation nature and its isolation from the financial system,\" Mr Bao says.\n\n\"I trust Bitcoin more. Because it really belongs to me,\" says Bitfool.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nChina\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nHong Kong\n\nBitcoin\n\nTop Stories\n\nGeorge Floyd's girlfriend recalls first meeting\n\nCourteney Ross gives emotional testimony during the fourth day of Derek Chauvin's murder trial.\n\nPublished\n\n1 hour ago\n\nChildren dropped over US border wall.

Designed to reduce wind noise when recording outdoors, the DeadCat VMP+ combines an open-cell foam surround with an outer layer of acoustically transparent artificial fur. A rubber base prevents any wind noise from entering the rear of the microphone pickup area, whilst ensuring a secure fit specifically suited to the VMP+ Microphone. The DeadCat VMP+ is only compatible with the VideoMic Pro+. For other VideoMic Pro models please see the DeadCat VMP and DeadCat VMPR.\n\n#productDescription h3 {\nmargin: 0.75em 0px 0.375em -1px;\n}\n\nFrom the manufacturer\n\nProtect your recordings from wind noise with a Deadcat.\n\nChoose the appropriate R\u00d8DE Deadcat for your microphone, and enjoy shooting outdoors with improved wind-noise protection.\n\nRead more\n\nDo I need a Deadcat?\n\nIf you plan to shoot outdoors, we strongly recommend using a Deadcat. With the appropriate Deadcat, fitted correctly, you can rest assured that your recordings are well protected against wind noise which would render footage unusable without it. Additionally, Deadcats can help protect against plosive sounds if using your VideoMic as a voice-over recording microphone. We at R\u00d8DE are animal lovers, so our Deadcats are produced using entirely artificial fur.\n\nDiscover the correct Deadcat for your microphone with our handy table below.\n\nRead more\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                              |                |                   |                                      |                                |                     |                            | \n|                              |  VideoMic User |  VideoMic GO User |                    VideoMic Pro User |  VideoMic Pro with Rycote User |  VideoMic Pro+ User |   Stereo VideoMic Pro User | \n| Which Microphone Do You Own? | R\u00d8DE VideoMic | R\u00d8DE VideoMic GO | R\u00d8DE VideoMic Pro (w/Elastic Bands) | R\u00d8DE VideoMic Pro with Rycote | R\u00d8DE VideoMic Pro+ | R\u00d8DE Stereo VideoMic Pro+ | \n|                    You Need: |        Deadcat |        Deadcat GO |                          Deadcat VMP |                   Deadcat VMPR |        Deadcat VMP+ |                 DeadKitten | \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomer Questions & Answers\n\nSee questions and answers\n\nCustomer reviews\n\n4.7 out of 5 stars\n\n4.7 out of 5\n\n266 global ratings\n\n------------------------------------------------\n|                              5 star |  | 82% | \n|                              4 star |  | 13% | \n|                              3 star |  |  4% | \n| 2 star                      0% (0%) |  |  0% | \n|                              1 star |  |  1% | \n------------------------------------------------\n\nHow are ratings calculated?\n\nTo calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don\u2019t use a simple average.

Nearly 7,000 patients are currently hospitalized, with about 20% of those in intensive care units.\n\nRead More\n\nCalifornia has seen a startling increase in coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths over the\n\npast two months\n\n. The state averaged more than 40,000 new coronavirus infections every day for the week prior to Christmas, according to data from Johns Hopkins University,\n\nfilling up hospitals and pushing health care workers to consider ways to ration care\n\n.\n\nShortage of oxygen canisters, too\n\nA patient lies on a stretcher in the hallway of the overloaded emergency room at Providence St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley, California, on December 23, 2020.\n\nTo solve the oxygen supply issue, some hospitals are moving Covid-19 patients down to lower floors within the medical center, which makes it easier to pump the oxygen through pipes without it freezing.\n\nAnother challenge, Ghaly said, is that several supply companies have a shortage of the actual oxygen canisters that patients can take home once discharged from the hospital. Without the canisters, patients who might otherwise be able to go home -- and free up a bed and health care workers' time -- have to stay in the hospital.\n\nLos Angeles County Department of Health Services confirmed that several hospitals have gone on \"internal disaster\" designation because of oxygen issues, closing themselves off to incoming EMS traffic. The hospitals most impacted are in the eastern areas of LA County and the San Fernando Valley, the department said.\n\nOne aspect of the issue was just the sheer amount of oxygen needed to treat severe Covid-19, which primarily affects the lungs.\n\n\"First, high levels of oxygen are necessary to treat patients with COVID-19, and that level may be up to 10 times more than normal usage,\" the deparmtent said in a statement. \"Hospitals in general are running out of oxygen sooner than under their normal conditions, and the oxygen suppliers are changing their processes to respond to the hospitals' needs.\"\n\nOther hospitals are seeing\n\nshortages of space and staff\n\n.\n\nRecord Covid-19 hospitalizations in US could soon force health experts to ration care\n\nAt Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital in Los Angeles, for example, patients are being treated in tents outside the hospital, in a conference room and in the chapel. Gurneys are taken into the gift shop. Rationing care could be next, hospital CEO Dr. Elaine Batchlor said Monday.\n\n\"If we continue to see an increase in the number of Covid patients, we may be forced to do something that, as health professionals, we all really just loathe having to even think about,\" she said.\n\nAt Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, California, nurses that usually care for one or two patients are now caring for three or four, infectious disease specialist Dr. Kimberly Shriner told CNN on Sunday.\n\n\"We have a limited number of ventilators, we have a limited number of ICU beds,\" Shriner said, adding that a team including a bioethicist, a community member, a physician, a nurse and an administrative leader will decide how to divide those resources if it comes down to it.\n\nThese issues can combine for some difficult decisions ahead, said CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner.\n\n\"If you don't have respirators, you don't have nurses to care for patients, you don't have ICU beds, we will have to have these terrible discussions with families, which is why people need to stay home, and when they go out, they need to wear a mask,\" Reiner said.\n\nCNN's Eric Levenson contributed to this report.\n\nSearch\n\nUS\n\nCrime + Justice\n\nEnergy + Environment\n\nExtreme Weather\n\nSpace + Science\n\nWorld\n\nAfrica\n\nAmericas\n\nAsia\n\nAustralia\n\nChina\n\nEurope\n\nIndia\n\nMiddle East\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Biden Presidency\n\nFacts First\n\nUS Elections\n\nBusiness\n\nMarkets\n\nTech\n\nMedia\n\nSuccess\n\nPerspectives\n\nVideos\n\nOpinion\n\nPolitical Op-Eds\n\nSocial Commentary\n\nHealth\n\nFood\n\nFitness\n\nWellness\n\nParenting\n\nVital Signs\n\nEntertainment\n\nStars\n\nScreen\n\nBinge\n\nCulture\n\nMedia\n\nTech\n\nInnovate\n\nGadget\n\nForeseeable Future\n\nMission: Ahead\n\nUpstarts\n\nWork Transformed\n\nInnovative Cities\n\nStyle\n\nArts\n\nDesign\n\nFashion\n\nArchitecture\n\nLuxury\n\nBeauty\n\nVideo\n\nTravel\n\nDestinations\n\nFood and Drink\n\nStay\n\nNews\n\nVideos\n\nSports\n\nPro Football\n\nCollege Football\n\nBasketball\n\nBaseball\n\nSoccer\n\nOlympics\n\nVideos\n\nLive TV\n\nDigital Studios\n\nCNN Films\n\nHLN\n\nTV Schedule\n\nTV Shows A-Z\n\nCNNVR\n\nAudio\n\nCoupons\n\nCNN Underscored\n\nExplore\n\nWellness\n\nGadgets\n\nLifestyle\n\nCNN Store\n\nWeather\n\nClimate\n\nStorm Tracker\n\nWildfire Tracker\n\nVideo\n\nMore\n\nPhotos\n\nLongform\n\nInvestigations\n\nCNN Profiles\n\nCNN Leadership\n\nCNN Newsletters\n\nWork for CNN\n\nUS\n\nFollow CNN\n\nTerms of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nAccessibility & CC\n\nAdChoices\n\nAbout Us\n\nCNN Store\n\nNewsletters\n\nTranscripts\n\nLicense Footage\n\nCNN Newsource\n\nSitemap\n\n\u00a9\n\n2021\n\nCable News Network.\n\nA Warner Media Company.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCNN Sans \u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network.\n\nif (WM.UserConsent.inUserConsentState([\"data-store\",\"measure-ads\",\"measure-content\",\"measure-market\",\"product-develop\"], { id: \"usabilla\" })) {CNN.INJECTOR.loadFeature('usabilla');}\n",

Here are the top 8.\n\nIn light of the current political crisis in Venezuela, a United States-supported opposition figure has announced a\n\ndisputed\n\npresidency.\n\nIt follows an\n\nattempted\n\ncoup by national guard members after the country\u2019s Supreme Court rejected a declaration by an opposition-controlled legislature that Nicolas Maduro\u2019s presidency was illegitimate.\n\nUS support for the opposition is not new.\n\nIn 2017, then CIA director Mike Pompeo\n\ncommented\n\nthat he was \u201chopeful that there can be a transition in Venezuela and we the CIA is doing its best to understand the dynamic there\u201d.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of US interventions, forced regime change and military coups in Latin America, the CIA director\u2019s words reflect an established approach for the United States in dealing with its southern neighbours, often away from the public eye and motivated by big business, economic interest and ideology.\n\nHere are eight of the most notorious cases of US interference in Latin America.\n\n1. Guatemala\n\nThe United Fruit Company (UFCO) was a highly successful American company that made major profits from bananas grown in Latin America and sold in the United States and Europe. Under Guatemalan dictator Jorge Ubico, the UFCO\n\ncontrolled\n\n42 percent of Guatemala\u2019s land and was exempt from tax and import duties. The company\n\nowned\n\nall of Guatemala's banana production, monopolised banana exports, and also owned the country's telephone and telegraph system, as well as almost all of its railroad track - while brutally repressing farm owners.\n\nIn 1944, the right-wing dictator Ubico was removed following the Guatemalan Revolution, as the country saw its first democratic election in history. In 1951, after another election, Colonel Jacobo Arbez became president and extended political freedoms to all, allowing communists to enter politics.\n\nThe United States was alarmed by the alleged spread of communism, and further by President Arbenz\u2019s\n\nproposed\n\n\u2018Decree 900\u2019, which would allow the redistribution of undeveloped lands held by large property owners to landless farmers, making up 90 percent of the population. Arbenz believed this was critical because at the time only two percent of landowners owned 70 percent of the land, while farmers worked in a form of debt slavery.\n\nThe United Fruit Company took an extreme position towards these reforms, and made use of its\n\nstrong ties\n\nto the Eisenhower administration to launch a massive anti-communist propaganda campaign against Guatemala.\n\nFollowing extensive lobbying, President Eisenhower chose to make use of the CIA to remove President Arbenz, in what came to be known as operation\n\nPBSUCCESS\n\n.\n\nThe CIA would go on to\n\norchestrate\n\na coup against the sitting president, building, arming and training an opposition force to overthrow him.\n\nArbenz was overthrown, and Guatemala was ruled by a military dictatorship for 40 years. During that time, nearly 250,000 Guatemalans were\n\nkilled\n\nor \u2018disappeared\u2019.\n\n2. Chile\u2019s brutal Pinochet regime\n\nAfter the democratic election of President Salvador Allende, who had ties to the Cuban Castro government, in 1970, US President Richard Nixon\n\nordered\n\nan economic war against Chile. This would be followed by a CIA-instigated\n\ncoup\n\nagainst Allende in 1973 by General Augusto Pinochet.\n\nFollowing the coup, Pinochet\u2019s regime would become one of the most oppressive and brutal military regimes of the 20th Century.\n\nThe US\n\nsupported\n\nPinochet\u2019s military dictatorship for decades. Pinochet banned political parties, dissolved congress and scrapped the constitution. He also censored the press, banned unions, permitted torture and repression, and according to one government report,\n\nkilled\n\nnearly 28,000 people during his rule.\n\n3. Invasion of Grenada\n\nGrenada is a small Caribbean island 150 km north of Venezuela. In 1979, a revolution led by Maurice Bishop\n\nsucceeded\n\nwith Cuban support. One of his projects was the construction of a large airstrip, which US President Reagan claimed was designed for Soviet aircraft.\n\nDuring an internal power struggle, while 800 US medical students were on the island, Reagan used the unrest as justification for ordering an invasion. On October 25, 1983, 10,000 US, Jamaican and Caribbean troops\n\ninvaded\n\nthe island, in a move that killed over 100 civilians and was condemned internationally by the UN General Assembly.\n\n4. Panama\n\nBefore Panama sought independence from Greater Colombia, the Colombian government was\n\nnegotiating\n\nwith the US to build a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. With the failure of negotiations, the US supported a separatist movement in Panama.\n\nOnce the country gained independence, French businessman Phillip Burnau-Varilla\n\nsold\n\nhis rights to building the Panama Canal to the US government. As a result, the US demanded full control of the canal and a 9.7 km zone around it.\n\nIn the 1970s, the CIA would go on to\n\nrecruit\n\nGeneral Manuel Noriega, who had previously run the country\u2019s secret police until his president\u2019s sudden death in a plane crash. He\n\nwent on\n\nto help Colombian drug trafficker Pablo Escobar smuggle cocaine, as well as helping the US smuggle weapons to Nicaraguan Contra death squads in what would later come to be known as the\n\nIran-Contra affair\n\n.\n\nIt was only when Noriega outlived his usefulness that he would be\n\noverthrown\n\nby the US in 1990, and arrested for corruption, racketeering and drug smuggling.\n\n5. Nicaragua\n\nThe US\n\noccupied\n\nNicaragua in 1912, going on to acquire rights to build a supposed \u2018Nicaragua Canal\u2019 from the US-backed Chamorro family. General Augusto Sandino led a rebellion against the conservative government and US occupation. Sandino was later assassinated and followed by the US-backed Somoza dictatorship.\n\nNot long after, the Sandinista revolution\n\noverthrew\n\nthe US-backed Somoza dictatorship and faced off against the US-sponsored Contra guerrilla rebels. This would later be publicised as the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nIn a\n\nblack book\n\noperation during the Reagan administration in 1985, the US sold 1,500 missiles to Iran in exchange for seven American hostages. Much of the $30 million paid by Iran for the weapons went to fund the Contras.\n\n6. Argentina\n\nIn 1976, Argentina\u2019s democratically elected President Isabel Peron was overthrown in a military coup d\u2019etat that lead to the deaths of nearly 30,000. The coup was supported and endorsed by the\n\nUnited States\n\ngovernment, with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger going to\n\nvisit\n\nthe newly-installed dictatorship several times.\n\nThe US-endorsed dictatorship committed grievous human rights violations while in power. Crimes included mass execution, extrajudicial arrest, torture and rape, as well as the\n\nrelocation\n\nof children born of pregnant detainees (before imprisonment, after continuous rape). Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon would later rule that Kissinger was a\n\nwitness\n\nto such crimes.\n\n7. Brazil\n\nIn 1964, President John F. Kennedy backed a coup d\u2019etat against Brazilian President Joao Goulart, \u201cto\n\nprevent\n\nBrazil from becoming another Cuba\u201d. Brazil\u2019s return to democracy would see several right-wing hardliner governments come to power, resulting in deep inequality and extreme\n\npoverty\n\nfor the country that continues to affect it to the present day.\n\n8. Cuba\n\nIn exchange for Cuba\u2019s independence, the US\n\nforced\n\nthe newly-independent nation to include the Platt Amendment in its new constitution. The\n\nPlatt Amendment\n\nprevented Cuba from leasing land to any country but the US, allowed for US intervention in Cuban affairs, and forbade it from negotiating any treaties with anyone but the US.\n\nThe Platt Amendment would also set the\n\nbasis\n\nfor leasing Guantanamo Bay to the US, allowing them to carry out extrajudicial torture on foreign soil.\n\nIn 1959, Fidel Castro\n\noverthrew\n\nthe US-backed military Batista government in power, causing alarm in the US over his explicit communist agenda and links to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Batista government\n\nopened\n\nHavana to US investment and tax refuge, exploitative tourism, organised crime syndicates and drugs, and announced that it would match, dollar for dollar, any investment over $1 million USD.\n\nPresident Eisenhower would oversee plans to overthrow Castro with the same model used in Guatemala, eventually\n\nimplemented\n\nby President Kennedy. In 1961,\n\nCIA-trained\n\nanti-Castro exiles landed in the Bay of Pigs, supported by US strikes on Cuban airfields.\n\nCastro\u2019s communist government was well\n\nequipped\n\nwith Soviet weapons, and defeated the invasion, which would lead to the notorious Cuban Missile Crisis stand-off the following year as the world came dangerously close to outright nuclear war.\n\nSource: TRT World\n\nAUTHOR\n\nAdam Bensaid\n\n@AdamABensaid\n\nAdam Bensaid is a deputy producer at TRT World.\n\nRelated News\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Guaido released after brief arrest\n\nPipe bomb package addressed to CNN in Atlanta intercepted\n\nPence aide testifies in Trump impeachment inquiry, Bolton a no-show\n\nThousands take to streets in the US to rally against gun-violence\n\nCategory News\n\nUS expresses concerns over Russia-Ukraine military tensions\n\nBiden unveils 'once-in-a-generation' $2T infrastructure investment plan\n\nUN envoy calls for action to prevent looming 'civil war' in Myanmar\n\nStore cashier expresses 'disbelief, guilt' over George Floyd's death\n\nVenezuela\n\nAmericas\n\nNorthern America\n\nUnited States of America\n\nSouth America\n\nBACK\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Guaido released after brief arrest\n\nPipe bomb package addressed to CNN in Atlanta intercepted\n\nPence aide testifies in Trump impeachment inquiry, Bolton a no-show\n\nThousands take to streets in the US to rally against gun-violence\n\nTrump blames Democrats for migrant 'caravan' without providing any proof\n\nBACK\n\n1\n\nUnited Airlines to hire 300 new pilots as air travel rebounds\n\n2\n\nChild among mass shooting victims in California\n\n3\n\nTwo Capitol police officers sue Trump over January 6 siege\n\n4\n\nSpaceX Mars rocket prototype breaks apart during test flight\n\n5\n\nFormer Minneapolis cop's trial in George Floyd's murder gets underway\n\nBACK\n\nShow people, places and other topics in this story\n\nRead articles related to this story\n\nSee what's popular on TRT World\n\nCLOSE\n\nWhat would you like to learn?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words.

Image: Getty\n\nStacked Farm, an Australian automated vertical indoor farm, has received international interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about the continuity of food supplies.\n\nThe farm produces salad greens and has the capacity for tomatoes and strawberries.\n\nCEO Conrad Smith told Business Insider Australia Stack Farm received significant interest from the Middle East.\n\nVisit Business Insider Australia\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nAussie company Stacked Farm, a fully automated vertical indoor farm, has been gaining international interest amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStacked Farm, founded in 2017, produces salad greens and herbs like lettuce and rocket, and has the capacity tp produce tomatoes and strawberries. It\u2019s even looking at testing out a type of blueberry next year.\n\nThe company has been receiving a lot of interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about virus clusters breaking out in the food supply chain. Back in May, a coronavirus cluster broke out at Melbourne\u2019s Cedar Meats abattoir, which was linked to 62 cases,\n\naccording to the ABC\n\n.\n\n\u201cPeople are more concerned than ever about who is handling their food, where it\u2019s coming from and how many stops it made before arriving on supermarket shelves,\u201d Stacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith said in a statement.\n\nThe company is headquartered in Burleigh Heads, Queensland and has plans to open up farms across Australia as well. \u201cA scaled-up farm in Victoria will be our first major commercial farm,\u201d Smith told Business Insider Australia. Its farm is fully automated, with the produce packed and sealed once its harvested by robotic farming.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pass through the usual supply chains either \u2013 greens and herbs can go directly to wholesalers, retails, hotels and restaurants, unlike traditional produce which passes through a number of hands before reaching our shelves,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\nStacked Farm has a partnership with fresh produce supplier Morco Fresh and counts Dnata as one of its clients as well, which provides aircraft services like flight catering.\n\n\u201cWe are not too dissimilar to a normal farm where we go through markets and we go through wholesalers and food service distributors,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAnd while it mainly supplies to the food service industry, Stacked Farm is looking at a move into retail so people can grab its produce from supermarket shelves as well. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the capacity to do that at the moment,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut when we scale up to our Victorian farm, we will certainly have the capacity to do that and we\u2019ll be looking for retail partners to jump on the journey that we\u2019re on.\u201d\n\nThe farms are temperature controlled and automated\n\nStacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith. Image: Troy Archer\n\nStacked Farm grows its produce 12 months a year, without relying on different seasons. Its products are grown in a temperature-controlled environment that is fully automated from seeding to harvesting. The company is looking at post-harvest automation as part of its next business phase.\n\nStacked Farm also makes barley-based livestock feed. \u201cIn a drought-vulnerable country like Australia, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there because while we all think about human consumption, animals are a massive part of the food chain that needs to be considered,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe company\u2019s employees are mainly in the science and tech field rather than traditional farm labourers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not like traditional farms where we require pickers, packers and harvesters,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe employ more labour leaning towards engineering, software engineering, mechanical engineering, CAD designers [and] horticultural scientists.\u201d\n\nThe company has been receiving interest from the Middle East\n\nStacked Farm has received international interest in its farm during the coronavirus pandemic, mainly thanks to concerns over food safety, quality and security.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of food chains that have been broken throughout this COVID-19 pandemic, and we\u2019ve had interest from the Middle East to set up farms there,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cWe have been very enthused by the interest from particularly a couple of states in the Middle East that have governments that really support local industry and local farming.\u201d Smith gave the example of Dubai which relies predominantly on imports.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\n\n, the United Arab Emirates imports up to 90% of its food.\n\nSmith explained that in Dubai, \u201ca lot of produce can\u2019t travel by sea\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve immediately recognised that there\u2019s a problem in their food chain and they need to bring tech businesses to their country to support feeding their people.\u201d And, in the case of Stacked Farm, can help feed livestock too.\n\nSmith added that Stacked Farm can support the future of food production, particularly in extremely hot and dry or extremely cold climates. He explained that\n\none in nine people go hungry\n\naround the world.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations\n\n, by 2050 world food demand is expected to rise by 70%.\n\n\u201cHaving urban indoor vertical farms is definitely [an] exciting prospect for the future,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe can literally shave days off out of the logistics process, we can extend the shelf life of products so there\u2019s less wastage and that in turn will benefit the community.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on\n\nFacebook\n\n,\n\nTwitter\n\n,\n\nLinkedIn\n\n, and\n\nInstagram\n\n.\n\nTagged In\n\naustralian stories\n\ncoronavirus\n\nfood chain\n\nqueensland\n\nstacked farm\n\nBusiness Insider Research\n\nI adopted a dog in 2020, and this handheld vacuum cleaner helped me keep fur off every surface in my house\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts\n\nSite highlights each day to your inbox.\n\nEmail Address\n\nJoin\n\nBusiness Insider Australia\n\nContact Editor\n\nGot A Story Tip?\n\nReport Issue\n\nBusiness Insider Video\n\nA company in Uganda is turning the waste from bananas into rugs, place mats, and baskets\n\nHow metalworkers in India are keeping the 600-year-old craft of Bidri art alive\n\nPopular on Facebook\n\nDoing these 24 uncomfortable things will pay off forever\n\nYes, Apple just killed iTunes \u2014 here's what that means for your library of music, movies, and TV shows\n\nWe took a 4-hour flight on the new Delta Airbus jet that Boeing tried to keep out of the US.

For decades, corporate media's propaganda machinery has been pedestalizing Bill Gates as a billionaire philanthropist genius who invented Microsoft and wishes to help humanity. But Bill Gates is neither a genius nor interested in the wellbeing of the working class and the poor. He was born into the 1% from a father who rubbed shoulders with central banking elites like the Rockefellers. Bill's grandfather was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Seattle. Bill's mother came from a long line of money and power as the daughter of a wealthy banker and the granddaughter of the president of the national city bank of Seattle and the director of the Seattle branch of the Federal Reserve. Bill Gates simply used his parent's money to pay the company that stole the DOS from its original inventor Gary Kildall. Bill also tried to conspire against his own partner Paul Allen by cunningly reducing his shares at Microsoft. After funding the creation of COVID19, Bill Gates is now appearing constantly on the Rothschild-owned corporate media to reaffirm his position that the martial law will never end unless everyone on Earth is forcefully vaccinated for the virus that he helped create. Yes, the same guy who created the world's first computer virus and who's currently in the business of viruses and vaccines, is promising the whole world a mandatory vaccine. Three years ago at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Bill Gates warned the world of a deadly coronavirus pandemic that could kill over 30 million people. In the same year of that speech, Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates vowed that they would not give up on their goal to implement population control (\"Family Planning\" in doublespeak) on 120 million women worldwide by 2020. Not only Bill Gates has been warning for years about a deadly coronavirus outbreak that would kill millions of people, but he also ran a coronavirus simulation a couple of months before the real outbreak in Wuhan. Scientists funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation simulated a global coronavirus pandemic that was dubbed Event 201, and it showed that a coronavirus outbreak could potentially kill hundreds of millions of people under the right circumstances. Bill Gates is now funding a 10-year-old company called Moderna to develop and patent a vaccine for COVID19. Moderna's stocks have been soaring since the beginning of the pandemic. Bill Gates is a known eugenicist who actively pursues population control through vaccinations and drugs around the globe. His obsession with population control, sterilization, and abortion is inspired by his father, who was the head of Planned Parenthood. He regularly gives televised speeches and openly talks about culling the global human population by 10 or 15% through vaccines. Hundreds of thousands of children in Africa and Asia died or were crippled by vaccine experiments conducted on them through corporations funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Most often these vaccines have been used as a trojan horse by Bill Gates to satisfy his obsession with population control. For example, under the guise of eradicating neonatal tetanus, a campaign funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation carried out a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise in Kenya in 2014 using an antigen that causes miscarriages in a vaccine that was administered to 2.3 million girls and women by the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Both the WHO and UNICEF are mercenary companies for Bill Gates.\n\n#BillGates #Plandemic #ID2020 #UNICEF #WHO #MedicalMartialLaw #MedicalMartialLaw2020 #MartialLaw #MartialLaw2020 #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #NWO #NewWorldOrder #COVID19 #COVID19Bioweapon #Coronavirus #COVID19Lockdown #BiologicalWeapons #WuhanCoronavirus #WuhanVirus #Pandemic #PopulationControl #FamilyPlanning #SelfIsolation #NewNorm #BigBrother #ProblemReactionSolution #BillAndMelindaGatesFoundation #GatesFoundation #GaryKildall #Microsoft #DOS\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://is.gd/p759wR\n\nhttps://is.gd/yX4nV5\n\nhttps://is.gd/22XdGn\n\nhttps://is.gd/YsU9iX\n\nhttps://is.gd/NUzpWa\n\nhttps://is.gd/mKvBaj\n\nhttps://is.gd/t9HSAc\n\nhttps://is.gd/5MOKII\n\nhttps://is.gd/3iJdqb\n\nhttps://is.gd/9b1tNU\n\nhttps://is.gd/Wyu55W\n\nhttps://is.gd/YltQ1Z\n\nhttps://is.gd/iSSiLR\n\nhttps://is.gd/wzhn0g\n\nhttps://is.gd/xEDruQ\n\nhttps://is.gd/nizrC7\n\nhttps://is.gd/GVQKgQ\n\nhttps://is.gd/XhlS3b\n\nhttps://is.gd/mCbdXK\n\nhttps://is.gd/wVUYvL\n\nhttps://is.gd/G85jPr\n\nhttps://is.gd/80bRg4\n\nhttps://is.gd/hsrcRq\n\nLESS\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|    Category |                                    News &amp; Politics | \n| Sensitivity | Normal - Content that is suitable for ages 16 and over | \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlaying Next\n\n313\n\n0:23\n\nLady Gaga Speaks At The World Health Organization\n\nBig Brother\n\n11\u00a0months, 2\u00a0weeks ago\n\nRelated Videos\n\n98\n\n1:46\n\nRIP Women's Sports\n\n5\u00a0days, 22\u00a0hours ago\n\n112\n\n1:00\n\nThe World Is So Fucked Up... \ud83d\ude14\n\n1\u00a0week ago\n\n91\n\n0:40\n\nC'mon Man!\n\n1\u00a0week, 3\u00a0days ago\n\n143\n\n2:12\n\nThere's No Hope For The Order-following Sheeple\n\n1\u00a0week, 5\u00a0days ago\n\n282\n\n1:13\n\nMeet The Chief Public Health Officer Of Canada\n\n1\u00a0week, 6\u00a0days ago\n\n149\n\n0:20\n\n\"Those Who Sacrifice Their Liberty For Safety Deserve Neither Liberty Nor Safety.\" \u2015 Benjamin Frankl\n\n2\u00a0weeks ago\n\nWarning - This video exceeds your sensitivity preference!\n\nTo dismiss this warning and continue to watch the video please click on the button below.\n\nNote -\n\nAutoplay has been disabled for this video.\n\nWatch this video\n\nBitChute is a peer-to-peer content sharing platform.

Photograph \u00a9 2016 Jonathan Foley.\n\nNo, Vertical Farms Won\u2019t Feed the World\n\nWhile they are well-intentioned, new indoor \u201cfarms\u201d won\u2019t help feed the world or reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture. We would be better to focus our efforts elsewhere.\n\nDr. Jonathan Foley\n\nFollow\n\nAug 1, 2018\n\n\u00b7\n\n6\n\nmin read\n\nW\n\ne\u2019re beginning to see a new fad in agriculture \u2014 so-called \u201cvertical farms\u201d that grow food\n\nindoors\n\nwith energy-intensive, artificial life support systems.\n\nIn the last few years, a number of tech companies have designed \u201cfarms\u201d that utilize artificial lights, heaters, water pumps, and computer controls to grow crops inside. These systems glow with a fantastic magenta light \u2014 from LEDs that are specially tuned to provide optimal light for photosynthesis \u2014 often with stacked trays of plants, one on top of the other. Some of this technology is new, especially the LEDs, although pot growers have used tools like this for years.\n\nSome of the more notable efforts to build indoor \u201cfarms\u201d include\n\nFreight Farms\n\nin Boston. And there is a group at MIT that is trying to create new high-tech platforms for growing food inside, including \u201c\n\nfood computers\n\n\u201d. These folks are very smart, and have done a lot to perfect the technology.\n\nAt first blush, these \u201cfarms\u201d sound great. Why not\n\ncompletely\n\neliminate food miles, and grow food right next to restaurants, cafeterias, or supermarkets? And why not grow crops inside closed systems, where water can be recycled, and pests can (in theory) be managed without chemicals.\n\nIt sounds great, doesn\u2019t it? But there are many challenges.\n\nF\n\nirst, Vertical Farms Cost a Fortune\n\nBut there are costs to these farms.\n\nHuge\n\ncosts.\n\nFirst, these systems are\n\nreally\n\nexpensive to build. The shipping container systems developed by\n\nFreight Farms\n\n, for example, cost between $82,000 and $85,000\n\nper container\n\n\u2014 an astonishing sum for a box that just grows greens and herbs. Just one container costs as much as 10 entire acres of prime American farmland \u2014 which is a far better investment, both in terms of food production and future economic value. Just remember: farmland has the benefit of generally\n\nappreciating\n\nin\n\nvalue over time\n\n, whereas a big metal box is likely to only decrease in value.\n\nSecond, food produced this way is\n\nvery\n\nexpensive. For example, the Wall Street Journal\n\nreports\n\nthat mini-lettuces grown by Green Line Growers costs more than\n\ntwice\n\nas much as organic lettuce available in most stores. And this is typical for other indoor growers around the country: it\u2019s very, very expensive, even compared to organic food. Instead of making food\n\nmore\n\navailable, especially to poorer families on limited budgets, these indoor crops are only available to the affluent. It might be fine for gourmet lettuce, or fancy greens for expensive restaurants, but regular folks may find it out of reach.\n\nFinally, indoor farms use\n\na lot\n\nof energy and materials to operate. The container farms from Freight Farms, for example, use about\n\n80 kilowatt-hours of electricity a day\n\nto power the lights and pumps. That\u2019s nearly 2\u20133 times as much electricity as a typical (and still very inefficient) American home, or about 8 times the electricity used by an average San Francisco apartment. And on the average American electrical grid, this translates to emitting\n\n44,000 pounds of CO2 per container per year\n\n, from electricity alone, not counting any additional heating costs. This is\n\nvastly\n\nmore than the emissions it would take to ship the food from someplace else.\n\nAnd none of it is necessary.\n\nB\n\nut, Wait, Can\u2019t Indoor Farms Use Renewable Energy?\n\nProponents of indoor techno-farms often say that they can offset the enormous sums of electricity they use, by powering them with renewable energy \u2014 especially solar panels \u2014 to make the whole thing carbon neutral.\n\nBut just stop and think about this for a second.\n\nThese indoor \u201cfarms\u201d would use solar panels to harvest naturally occurring sunlight, and convert it into electricity, so that they can power\u2026\n\nartificial sunlight\n\n? In other words\n\n,\n\nthey\u2019re\n\ntrying to use the sun to replace the sun.\n\nBut we don\u2019t need to replace the sun. Of all of the things we should worry about in agriculture, the availability of free sunlight is not one of them. Any system that seeks to replace the sun to grow food is probably a bad idea.\n\nB\n\nesides, \u201cFood Miles\u201d Aren\u2019t a Big Climate Problem\n\nSometimes we hear that vertical farms help the environment by reducing \u201cfood miles\u201d \u2014 the distance food items travel from farm to table \u2014 and thereby reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis sounds logical, but it turns out to be a red herring.\n\nStrange as it might seem, local food typically uses about the same amount of energy \u2014 per pound \u2014 to transport as food grown far away. Why? Short answer: volume and method of transport. A larger food operator can ship food more efficiently \u2014 even if it travels longer distances \u2014 because of the gigantic volumes they work in. Plus, ships, trains, and even large trucks driving on Interstate highways use less fuel, per pound per mile, than small trucks driving around town.\n\nPlus it turns out that \u201cfood miles\u201d aren\u2019t a very big source of CO2 emissions anyway, whether they\u2019re local or not. In fact, they pale in comparison to emissions from deforestation, methane from cattle and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from over-fertilized fields. And local food systems \u2014 especially organic farms that use fewer fertilizers, and grass fed beef that sequesters carbon in the soil \u2014 can reduce these more critical emissions. At the end of the day, local food systems are generally better for the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions. Just don\u2019t worry about emissions from food miles too much.\n\nA\n\nnd These Vertical \u201cFarms\u201d Can\u2019t Grow Much\n\nA further problem with indoor farms is that a lot of crops could never develop properly in these artificial conditions. While LED lights provide the light needed for\n\nphotosynthesis\n\nto occur, they don\u2019t provide the proper mix of light and heat to trigger plant development stages \u2014 like those that tell plants when to put on fruit or seed. Moreover, a lot of crops need a bit of wind to develop tall, strong stalks, needed later when they are carrying heavy loads before harvest. As a result, indoor farms are severely limited, and have a hard time growing things besides simple greens.\n\nIndoor farms might be able to provide some\n\ngarnish\n\nand\n\nsalads\n\nto the world, but forget about them as a means of growing much other\n\nfood\n\n.\n\nA Better Way?\n\nI\u2019m not the only critic of indoor, high-tech, energy-intensive agriculture. Other authors are starting to point out the problems with these systems too (read very good critiques\n\nhere\n\n,\n\nhere\n\n,\n\nhere\n\n, and\n\nhere\n\n).\n\nWhile I appreciate the enthusiasm and innovation put into developing indoor farms, I think these efforts are, at the end of the day, counterproductive.\n\nInstead, I think we should use the same investment of dollars, incredible technology, and amazing brains to solve other agricultural problems \u2014 like developing new methods for drip irrigation, better grazing systems that lock up soil carbon, and ways of recycling on-farm nutrients. Organic farming and high-precision agriculture are doing promising things, and need more help. We also need innovation and capital to help other parts of the food system, especially in tackling food waste, and getting people to shift their diets towards more sustainable directions.\n\nAn interconnected network of good farms \u2014real farms that provide nutritious food, with social and environmental benefits to their communities \u2014 is the kind of innovation we really need.\n\nNOTE: parts of this piece were adapted from an earlier blog article of mine called\n\n\u201cLocal Food is Great, But Can It Go Too Far?\u201d\n\nDr.\n\nJonathan Foley\n\n(@\n\nGlobalEcoGuy\n\n) is a climate & environmental scientist, writer, and speaker.

Yet, Xi\u2019s outward strongman image is a veneer over his inner insecurity. When he came into power in late 2012, China\u2019s economy had slowed down from double-digit growth to single-digit growth; the mass working-age population, which had been the engine of China\n\n\u2019\n\ns economic growth, has begun to decline. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington, D.C.\u2013based think tank,\n\nprojects\n\nthat by 2030, \u201cChina will round out its thinning labor force by hiring workers from abroad.\u201d At the same time, according to Mark Haas, a political-science professor at Duquesne University, \u201cChina alone in 2050 will have more than 329 million people over 65.\u201d Consequently, China is expected to be the first major economy that will grow older before it achieves widespread prosperity.\n\nWithout its demographic dividend and with an aging population, China\u2019s economic growth will further slow down at the time when the government needs to keep its growing middle class from demanding a level of political freedom matching their newfound wealth. An aging population would also force the government to allocate more national resources for elder care and social services, which means there will be fewer resources to compete against the U.S. This is probably one of the most important reasons why Xi feels that he has to abandon the so-called strategic-patience guidance issued by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1997, who instructed his comrades to bide their time and avoid any confrontation with powerful external forces until China was in a much stronger position both economically and militarily.\n\nXi, however, believes that China can\u2019t afford to bide its time any longer. It must replace the liberal world order with a Sino-centric world order before China\n\n\u2019\n\ns population becomes too old and the Chinese economy becomes too stagnant. However, rather than furthering economic reform and opening up more sectors to foreign investment and competition to strengthen its economy, Xi chose to hide China\u2019s weaknesses and exaggerate China\u2019s economic strengths. He emphasizes self-reliance and utilizing China\u2019s resources to pump up \u201cnational champions,\u201d or state-owned enterprises that could compete against global leaders in strategic sectors. Xi feels that nationalism is his new trump card, something he can use to motivate, excite, and unite a billion people all the while strengthening the CCP\u2019s rule over them. Others say that his inward-looking nationalist policies are leading China to the very\n\nmiddle-income trap\n\n\u2014 in which China\u2019s level of development stalls out before reaching the heights of other modern industrial nations \u2014 that Xi and his predecessors tried very hard to avoid.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet the more the Chinese economy slows down, the more Xi feels the need to project a strongman image both abroad and, especially, at home. As Wang Gungwu and Zheng Yongnian, two Chinese scholars, wrote in\n\nChina and the New International Order\n\n, this dynamic has deep roots in Chinese history: \u201cChina\u2019s internal order was so closely related to her international order that one could not long survive without the other; when the barbarians were not submissive abroad, rebels might more easily arise within. Most dynasties collapsed under the twin blows of inside disorder and outside calamity,\n\nnei luan wai hu\n\na\n\nn\n\ng\n\n, that is, domestic rebellion and foreign invasion.\u201d\n\nXi is keenly aware that he is vulnerable to internal rebellion. He has purged more than 1.5 million government officials, military leaders, and party elites. His trade war with the U.S. is deeply unpopular inside China because it has caused economic pains such as rising unemployment, closing of factories, and the shifting of the global supply chain out of China. Xi knows very well that if he shows any signs of weakness, he may end up like his political rival, Bo Xilai \u2014 a princeling who is currently languishing in a notorious Chinese prison for high-level party officials.\n\nIn addition, Xi saw former U.S. President Obama as a \u201cweak\u201d leader who led a nation that was on its way to inevitable decline, which opened up an unprecedented opportunity for China. Xi also has certain milestones he wants to reach: In 2021, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, and in 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of Communist China. Xi wants to do something big to cement his place in history when he reaches these milestones. Therefore, in his mind, the era of hiding strength and biding time is over. He wants to show the world a new set of policies, actions, and attitudes that match China\u2019s powerful status.\n\nFor a while, Xi was succeeding. Internally, he ruthlessly cracked down on religious believers, political dissenters, party officials, and business elites. He also built a mass surveillance state that turned the dystopian nightmare imagined by George Orwell\u2019s\n\n1984\n\ninto a reality. Internationally, he imposed his strong will on businesses and nations big and small through his signature project \u201cOne Belt and One Road.\u201d The way Xi sees it, the more other countries become economically dependent on China, the more he can dominate them peacefully without having to use force. One commentator\n\nhas observed\n\nthat Xi \u201cresembles a clenched fist. At home, he is clenching hard to assert his control. To the outside world, he is a hard-thrusting force determined to get his way.\u201d Xi\u2019s fist has conditioned many nations including the Western democracies to believe that China is stronger than it actually is and that China\u2019s global dominance is inevitable. Therefore, few are willing to challenge China\u2019s human-rights violations at home and its assertive behavior abroad.\n\nBut even the most powerful emperor can fly too close to the sun. The dissenting voices inside China are getting louder, while global backlash against China reached new heights in 2019. Then the 2020 coronavirus outbreak stripped the facade of Xi\u2019s powerful image, revealed deep flaws within the CCP\u2019s dictatorial political system, caused immense anger and frustration among Chinese people, brought serious detriments to China\u2019s prestigious international image, and brought China\u2019s seemingly unstoppable rise to a halt. As the prominent Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai has written, \u201cThe more Mr. Xi pursues his authoritarian agenda, the more distrust he will sow at home and abroad. Far from transforming Beijing into the world\u2019s leading superpower, his policies will instead keep China from taking its rightful place of honor in a peaceful, modern and integrated world.\u201d Xi has misread the situation, overplayed his hand, and his aggressive policies at home and abroad have backfired, proving the saying: Those whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.\n\nMore from National Review\n\nWolf Warrior II Tells Us a Lot about China\n\nDo Autocracies Really Have an Advantage over Democracies?\n\nChina Accelerates Its Crackdown on Foreign Journalists\n\n{\n        \"caasUrl\": \"https://www.yahoo.com/caas/content/article/\",\n        \"contextParams\": \"\"\n    }\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nYahoo News\n\n'Skullduggery' political podcast: Prosecuting the police \u2014 March 31, 2021\n\nThe trial of Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd is underway in Minneapolis, and it represents a moment of grave importance in the fight against police brutality and abuse of power.\n\n2d ago\n\nReuters\n\nCCTV shows couple in Seoul daubing over $500,000 graffiti artwork\n\n(Reuters) -A couple in South Korea accused of damaging artwork by American graffiti artist JonOne said they had mistakenly thought they were allowed to daub paint on the piece as \"participatory art\", the head of the exhibition said on Friday.

Never mind that as one of the finest baritones in the world his booming voice makes it hard to be discreet.\u201cThe truth about opera singers is that food and drinks are pretty much the only topic we discuss. When they know you\u2019ve been hired to sing in a new opera house, your musician friends will give you their list,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhere to get the best t\u00e4ffelspitz with cream spinach if you\u2019re in Vienna. The address of Pavarotti\u2019s cook in Genova. The best wine bar in Madrid. Believe me, nobody knows food and drinks like an opera singer.\u201dCan the Roaring Twenties Teach Us About Post-Pandemic Life?How to Avoid Overhyped and Overpriced BourbonSuch is the unconventional life of travel led by opera singers, or at least was before the spread of Covid-19. And that life also came with its spells of homesickness. \u201cI remember my debut at the Met,\u201d says T\u00e9zier. \u201cIt was the year 2000 and I was singing Escamillo in Carmen. I loved New York City right away but food wise, it was challenging. The Parmigiano cheese I found at my local supermarket was from Cincinnati. So, when my American agent asked me to stay one more week for a televised concert\u2014the opportunity of a lifetime she insisted\u2014I said no way, I\u2019m out of here. I need to go back home for real cheese! She thought I was nuts. Obviously, the New York food scene has changed a lot since then, only for the better.\u201dIn the last 20 years, 52-year old T\u00e9zier has been back at the Metropolitan Opera many times, most notably in Donizetti\u2019s Lucia di Lammermoor as the main character\u2019s villainous father. (This 2011, production is currently available for streaming on the Met\u2019s website.)In December, providing Lincoln Center reopens in time, T\u00e9zier is set to sing the tragic title role in Rigoletto, one of Verdi\u2019s finest operas. The great Italian composer is very much on T\u00e9zier\u2019s mind these days as shown by his exquisite first solo album simply titled Verdi (Sony Classical), which was just released this winter. \u201cWe recorded in Bologna, which is one of the very best places to eat and drink in the world. I mean Luciano [Pavarotti] grew up a few miles away in Modena. That says it all.\u201dFor T\u00e9zier, his love of food and drink began by the Mediterranean where he grew up on France\u2019s beautiful coast. He still speaks with a warm and musical accent common in his hometown of Marseilles. \u201cWhat really rocked my world was a summer holiday in the Gers region, that\u2019s in the Southwest of France. We were staying on a farm and believe me, there was a depth of knowledge there,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI remember this woman, beautifully-named Z\u00e9lie. What a cook! She prepared zucchini flowers fritters that were heavenly. With the male flowers, mind you, because if you use the females you ruin the chain of reproduction. And she made incredible pastries in her wood oven. The thin dough was filled with crab apples in an Armagnac sauce.\u201d GREGOR HOHENBERG/SONY MUSIC Since then, the famed brandy has remained a personal favorite of his. \u201cI remember the locals pouring Armagnac in balloon glasses, savoring it and talking about the variety of tastes they perceived. I remember the wonderful, vanilla-like smell of the alcohol maturing in the oak barrels. And seeing the transparent color of the [unaged] brandy presented in a thimble for everybody to admire and the mahogany colors of the mature one. Beautiful memories.\u201dIs there a vocal benefit to drinking before a concert or is liquor a singing hazard? \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the urban legends,\u201d T\u00e9zier admits. \u201cNamely that you should drink whiskey to get a lower register or a glass of Bordeaux to lubricate the vocal cords. Personally, I don\u2019t do any of it for the same reason that an athlete doesn\u2019t drink before a game. Alcohol stiffens the muscles and that\u2019s all the vocal cords are, it\u2019s pretty simple. So, I enjoy a nice drink after a show or on my downtime in Alsace.\u201dMangia! Inside Luciano Pavarotti\u2019s Italian KitchenT\u00e9zier, his wife, the soprano Cassandre Berthon, and their young son, have settled into a house near wine country in Dorlisheim, which is not too far from Strasburg. \u201cA guy from Marseilles who finds a home in Alsace, it\u2019s not that common, but it\u2019s my story,\u201d says T\u00e9zier. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of the savoir faire of these winemakers who are our neighbors. I can recommend the Rangen de Thann for instance, a wonderful, joyous white wine. It is also a rarity because the workers have to rope down the hill to collect the grapes. A wine like that can produce in you great emotions. Pretty much like music. There is great music all around\u2026and then there is Mozart.\u201dSo if Rangen de Thann goes with Mozart, then what do you drink while listening to Verdi\u2019s operas? T\u00e9zier doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cA glass of Amarone della Valpolicella,\u201d he says. \u201cSpicy and deep, with a touch of a violent, beastly feeling to it\u2026That wine is pure Verdi.\u201dRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Poor old Joe Biden. He might have won the electoral college and the popular vote but he\u2019ll never feel the love of his underlings like Donald Trump did. The former president\u2019s first full cabinet meeting in June 2017 remains an unparalleled opera of oleaginousness. Secretary after secretary all but flung themselves at his feet, sang songs of praise and paid homage to the divine emperor of the universe. Has any parent ever known such undying adoration from their child? Only King Lear from Goneril and Regan, perhaps. And most telling was the fact that the world was allowed to see it. Trump made sure it was one more chapter in his reality TV presidency. Not really Biden\u2019s style. His first cabinet meeting on Thursday was relocated to the East Room because of coronavirus restrictions \u2013 the 16 permanent members wore face masks and sat in a giant square with empty chairs between them \u2013 but was otherwise a return to the staid old way of doing things. The main item on the agenda was not the American president\u2019s sculpted handsomeness, nor his towering intellect, nor his indubitable virility, nor his ability to hit holes in one, but merely his freshly announced $2tn infrastructure plan. Flanked by the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, with the vice-president, Kamala Harris, opposite, Biden said he was asking five cabinet members to \u201ctake special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public\u201d. He took no questions from the media and, after less than two and a half minutes, reporters were ushered out. \u201cI thank the press for being here, but I\u2019ll talk to you all later.\u201d The 16 permanent members wore face masks and sat in a giant square with empty chairs between them. Photograph: Leigh Vogel/EPA But even this brief glimpse behind the curtain spoke volumes about how much has changed. White men composed nearly three-quarters of Trump\u2019s cabinet; they make up only a third of Biden\u2019s. On Thursday the East Room included Harris, the first woman and first woman of colour to serve as vice-president; Janet Yellen, the first woman to lead the treasury department; Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay secretary confirmed to the cabinet; and Deb Haaland, the first Native American in a president\u2019s cabinet. \u201cThis is the first in American history that the cabinet looks like America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we promised we were going to do, and we\u2019ve done it.\u201d If Trump represented a backlash against America\u2019s first Black president, Biden\u2019s cabinet represents a backlash against the backlash. Their refusal to play to the cameras with ever escalating sycophancy was also a reminder that the reality TV presidency did not get renewed for a second season. Ratings are down and, such is the absence of scandals, Biden\u2019s pet dogs are making news for biting people and depositing poo in a White House hallway. Cabinet members like Tom Vilsack and Denis McDonough simply can\u2019t compete with Ben Carson or Rick Perry for comic effect. Spare a thought for the late-night comedians suddenly going cold turkey. How they feasted on that first Trump cabinet meeting, which began with Mike Pence declaring that it was \u201cthe greatest privilege of my life to serve as the vice-president to the president who is keeping his word to the American people\u201d. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, followed up: \u201cWe thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you\u2019ve given us to serve your agenda.\u201d As Trump went around the room, nearly every secretary strove to outdo the one before in the olympics of obsequiousness. Late-night comedian Stephen Colbert summed up: \u201cThese are adults, some of them are billionaires, and they\u2019re just happy to have their leashes yanked as the cameras roll for the dear leader. \u201cI did not know that Trump has such a strict \u2018please check your balls at the door\u2019 policy. Honestly, this is next-level weird. This is an unprecedented public stroke-fest for an emotionally frail man.\u201d It was, of course, funny until it wasn\u2019t. In a country where politics is the new religion, with all its faith and fervour and absolutes, worship of that particular Messiah led all the way to the deadly storming of the US Capitol on 6 January. Ordinary Joe is more in the vein of Bertolt Brecht: unhappy the land that is in need of heroes.\n\n16h ago\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nBiden wants to spend $100 billion to get you better internet access, then $174 billion so you can take an electric vehicle anywhere\n\nPresident Joe Biden's infrastructure plan would wire up every corner of the nation with access to broadband for internet and EV charging stations.\n\n18h ago\n\nMore Stories\n\nTRENDING\n\nNBC News\n\nJill Biden pulls off April Fools' Day prank on media, staff\n\nNBC News\n\n\u00b7\n\n1 min read\n\nABC News\n\nRemains of missing 10-year-old girl found in rural Iowa, police say\n\nABC News\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 min read\n\nReuters\n\n'Every step of the way': McConnell pledges battle over Biden infrastructure plan\n\nReuters\n\n\u00b7\n\n2 min read\n\nThe New York Times\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Your Vaccine Card\n\nThe New York Times\n\n\u00b7\n\n7 min read\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDaughter: Bystander disrupted attack on Asian American woman\n\nAssociated Press\n\n\u00b7\n\n3 min read\n\nPOPULAR\n\n'Skullduggery' political podcast: Prosecuting the police \u2014 March 31, 2021\n\nYahoo News\n\nCCTV shows couple in Seoul daubing over $500,000 graffiti artwork\n\nReuters\n\nBlue Jays beat Yankees 3-2 in 10th inning as fans return\n\nAssociated Press\n\n56 celebrities you probably forgot guest-starred on 'How I Met Your Mother'\n\nINSIDER\n\nStokes twins: YouTubers plead guilty over fake bank robbery\n\nBBC\n\nThese Modern Dressers Prove That Style and Function Are One and the Same\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nEU urges China to ensure freedom of speech after BBC journalist leaves country\n\nReuters\n\nA deer crashed through the windshield of a school bus in Virginia and landed on a student, video shows\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOxfam suspends two aid workers amid sex exploitation claims in DR Congo\n\nBBC\n\nPlant Art Is the Logical Next Step in Our Flora Obsession\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nOpposition grows against UK vaccine passports\n\nReuters\n\nAll the CEOs that have spoken out against Georgia's new voting restrictions\n\nAxios\n\nNobody Knows Food and Drinks like an Opera Singer\n\nThe Daily Beast\n\nKremlin says that any NATO troop deployment to Ukraine would raise tensions\n\nReuters\n\n{\"geminiAds\":{\"geminiDedupeToken\":\"PHToken\"}}\n",

I can't even begin to imagine what I'd do if a 512GB card crashed!\n\nTwo 32GB cards work out slightly cheaper per gigabyte than one 64GB too (59p compared to 61p). However, it has to be admitted that the larger cards beat them both on price (the 512GB card is around 46p per gigabyte).\n\nRead more\n\n81 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nR.\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nA solid card\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2019\n\nColour Name: Black\n\nSize Name: 64GB\n\nStyle Name: UHS-I CARD ONLY\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI've always opted for SanDisk Extreme Pro SD cards because I've found they provide me exactly what I need for my camera.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Good writing speed for photography and uploading to PC\n\n2. Enough storage size for a good price.\n\n3. I feel safer using this card, it seems based on my experience with other brands that there's a lower chance of SanDisk Extreme Pro cards malfunctioning.\n\n4. It also looks nice (I don't know if this is something people care about, but I like it)\n\nCons:\n\n1. I can't comment on tech support, as I haven't had to use it.\n\n2. Writing speed not 170MB/s (so the described speed actually refers to the read speed, but if you want speeds like this, you have to be willing to pay loads more, no matter the brand. Write speed is still fast enough for all the photos and videos I've ever had to shoot).\n\nRead more\n\n50 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nBen23\n\n2.0 out of 5 stars\n\nSevere reliability problems with iMac\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 May 2019\n\nColour Name: Black\n\nSize Name: 64GB\n\nStyle Name: UHS-I CARD ONLY\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nI bought two of these cards to use in my Panasonic Lumix G9 and G80 cameras, where they appear to work fine (though they are no faster than my previous gold Extreme cards). However, they are proving to be extremely unreliable when inserted into my (late 2015) iMac's built-in card reader. Sometimes they work (though again, the read speed is no faster than the older cards), but a lot of the time they don't. They mount fine, but the image files are either absent, or they start off present and then disappear from the folders or can't be read. Fortunately, the files are actually still there, and by putting the card back in the camera and downloading over USB I was able to read them. But because of this, I don't 100% trust them, and will only use them in my G9 with an Extreme card in the second slot as backup.\n\nThese cards have also had issues with some Sony cameras (see other reviews) which leads me to believe there is a particular problem with the ones designated 170MB/s.\n\nI have confirmed that the cards have their stated capacity using the F3 program, and I don't believe they're fake (I also bought them direct from Amazon, not from a Marketplace seller).\n\nI have always used Sandisk cards because they have always been reliable, but they seem to have dropped the ball on these ones, perhaps by bending the UHS-I standard a little too much in the pursuit of a higher headline read speed (which you will never see in a standard card reader anyway).\n\nRead more\n\n32 people found this helpful\n\nHelpful\n\nReport abuse\n\nBobble\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nHandles 4K video nicely\n\nReviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2019\n\nColour Name: Black\n\nSize Name: 128GB\n\nStyle Name: UHS-I CARD ONLY\n\nVerified Purchase\n\nReview for: SanDisk Extreme PRO 128 GB SDXC Memory Card (170MB/s)\n\nUsing inside a very good camera and it copes with 4K 50fps vide nicely.

Although, there is an entertainment facet to keep your children engaged, each game is generally designed to work with a specific expertise or curriculum, such as numbers or research.

Note: Other federal laws, as well as state or local laws, may provide employees with additional protections.\n\nTitle I of the ADA applies to private employers with 15 or more employees. It also applies to state and local government employers, employment agencies, and labor unions. All nondiscrimination standards under Title I of the ADA also apply to federal agencies under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. Basic background information about the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is available on EEOC's\n\ndisability page\n\n.\n\nThe EEO laws, including the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, continue to apply during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they do not interfere with or prevent employers from following the\n\nguidelines and suggestions made by the CDC or state/local public health authorities\n\nabout steps employers should take regarding COVID-19.\n\nEmployers should remember that guidance from public health authorities is likely to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Therefore, employers should continue to follow the most current information on maintaining workplace safety.\n\nMany common workplace inquiries about the COVID-19 pandemic are addressed in the CDC publication \u201c\n\nGeneral Business Frequently Asked Questions\n\n.\u201d\n\nThe EEOC has provided guidance (a publication entitled\n\nPandemic Preparedness in the Workplace and the Americans With Disabilities Act\n\n[\n\nPDF version\n\n]) (\"Pandemic Preparedness\"), consistent with these workplace protections and rules, that can help employers implement strategies to navigate the impact of COVID-19 in the workplace. This pandemic publication, which was written during the prior H1N1 outbreak, is still relevant today and identifies established ADA and Rehabilitation Act principles to answer questions frequently asked about the workplace during a pandemic. It has been updated as of March 19, 2020 to address examples and information regarding COVID-19;\n\nthe new 2020 information appears in bold and is marked with an asterisk\n\n.\n\nOn March 27, 2020 the EEOC provided a webinar (\"3/27/20 Webinar\") which was recorded and transcribed and is available at\n\nwww.eeoc.gov/coronavirus\n\n. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 to be an international pandemic. The EEOC pandemic publication includes a\n\nseparate section\n\nthat answers common employer questions about what to do after a pandemic has been declared. Applying these principles to the COVID-19 pandemic, the following may be useful:\n\nA. Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Exams\n\nThe ADA has restrictions on when and how much medical information an employer may obtain from any applicant or employee. Prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category. Once an employee begins work, any disability-related inquiries or medical exams must be job related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nA.1.\n\nHow much information may an employer request from an employee who calls in sick, in order to protect the rest of its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nDuring a pandemic, ADA-covered employers may ask such employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus. For COVID-19, these include symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.\n\nA.2. When screening employees entering the workplace during this time, may an employer only ask employees about the COVID-19 symptoms EEOC has identified as\n\nexamples\n\n, or may it ask about any symptoms identified by public health authorities as associated with COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAs public health authorities and doctors learn more about COVID-19, they may expand the list of associated symptoms. Employers should rely on the CDC, other public health authorities, and reputable medical sources for guidance on emerging symptoms associated with the disease. These sources may guide employers when choosing questions to ask employees to determine whether they would pose a direct threat to health in the workplace. For example, additional symptoms beyond fever or cough may include new loss of smell or taste as well as gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.\n\nA.3.\n\nWhen may an ADA-covered employer take the body temperature of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nGenerally, measuring an employee's body temperature is a medical examination. Because the CDC and state/local health authorities have acknowledged community spread of COVID-19 and issued attendant precautions, employers may measure employees' body temperature. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\n\nA.4.\n\nDoes the ADA allow employers to require employees to stay home if they have symptoms of the COVID-19?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nYes. The CDC states that employees who become ill with symptoms of COVID-19 should leave the workplace. The ADA does not interfere with employers following this advice.\n\nA.5.\n\nWhen employees return to work, does the ADA allow employers to require a doctor's note certifying fitness for duty?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nYes. Such inquiries are permitted under the ADA either because they would not be disability-related or, if the pandemic were truly severe, they would be justified under the ADA standards for disability-related inquiries of employees. As a practical matter, however, doctors and other health care professionals may be too busy during and immediately after a pandemic outbreak to provide fitness-for-duty documentation. Therefore, new approaches may be necessary, such as reliance on local clinics to provide a form, a stamp, or an e-mail to certify that an individual does not have the pandemic virus.\n\nA.6. May an employer administer a COVID-19 test (a test to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus)\n\nwhen evaluating an employee\u2019s initial or continued presence in the workplace?\n\n(4/23/20; updated 9/8/20 to address stakeholder questions about updates to CDC guidance)\n\nThe ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be \u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d Applying this standard to the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers may take screening steps to determine if\n\nemployees entering the workplace have COVID-19\n\nbecause\n\nan individual with the virus will pose a direct threat\n\nto the health of others. Therefore an employer may choose to administer COVID-19 testing to employees before initially permitting them to enter the workplace and/or periodically to determine if their presence in the workplace poses a direct threat to others. The ADA does not interfere with employers following\n\nrecommendations by the CDC\n\nor other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate. Testing administered by employers consistent with current CDC guidance will meet the ADA\u2019s \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d standard.\n\nConsistent with the ADA standard, employers should ensure that the tests are considered accurate and reliable. For example, employers may review\n\ninformation\n\nfrom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about what may or may not be considered safe and accurate testing, as well as guidance from CDC or other public health authorities. Because the CDC and FDA may revise their recommendations based on new information, it may be helpful to check these agency websites for updates. Employers may wish to consider the incidence of false-positives or false-negatives associated with a particular test. Note that a positive test result reveals that an individual most likely has a current infection and may be able to transmit the virus to others. A negative test result means that the individual did not have detectable COVID-19 at the time of testing.\n\nA negative test does not mean the employee will not acquire the virus later. Based on guidance from medical and public health authorities, employers should still require\u2013to the greatest extent possible\u2013that employees observe infection control practices (such as social distancing, regular handwashing, and other measures) in the workplace to prevent transmission of COVID-19.\n\nNote: Question A.6 and A.8 address screening of employees generally. See Question A.9 regarding decisions to screen individual employees.\n\nA.7. CDC said in its\n\nInterim Guidelines\n\nthat antibody test results \u201cshould not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace.\u201d In light of this CDC guidance, under the ADA may an employer require antibody testing before permitting employees to re-enter the workplace?\n\n(6/17/20)\n\nNo. An antibody test constitutes a medical examination under the ADA. In light of CDC\u2019s\n\nInterim Guidelines\n\nthat antibody test results \u201cshould not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace,\u201d an antibody test at this time does not meet the ADA\u2019s \u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity\u201d standard for medical examinations or inquiries for current employees. Therefore, requiring antibody testing before allowing employees to re-enter the workplace is not allowed under the ADA. Please note that an antibody test is different from a test to determine if someone has an active case of COVID-19 (i.e., a viral test). The EEOC has already stated that COVID-19 viral tests are\n\npermissible under the ADA\n\n.\n\nThe EEOC will continue to closely monitor CDC\u2019s recommendations, and could update this discussion in response to changes in CDC\u2019s recommendations.\n\nA.8. May employers ask all employees physically entering the workplace if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 1)\n\nYes. Employers may ask all employees who will be physically entering the workplace if they have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19, and ask if they have been tested for COVID-19. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 include, for example, fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. The CDC has identified a\n\ncurrent list of symptoms\n\n.\n\nAn employer may exclude those with COVID-19, or symptoms associated with COVID-19, from the workplace because, as EEOC has stated, their presence would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. However, for those employees who are teleworking and are not physically interacting with coworkers or others (for example, customers), the employer would generally not be permitted to ask these questions.\n\nA.9. May a manager ask only one employee\u2014as opposed to asking all employees\u2014questions designed to determine if she has COVID-19, or require that this employee alone have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 3)\n\nIf an employer wishes to ask only a particular employee to answer such questions, or to have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing, the ADA requires the employer to have a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that this person might have the disease. So, it is important for the employer to consider why it wishes to take these actions regarding this particular employee, such as a display of COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, the ADA does not interfere with employers following\n\nrecommendations by the CDC\n\nor other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate.\n\nA.10. May an employer ask an employee who is physically coming into the workplace whether they have family members who have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 4)\n\nNo. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers from asking employees medical questions about family members. GINA, however, does not prohibit an employer from asking employees whether they have had contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 or who may have symptoms associated with the disease. Moreover, from a public health perspective, only asking an employee about his contact with family members would unnecessarily limit the information obtained about an employee\u2019s potential exposure to COVID-19.\n\nA.11. What may an employer do under the ADA if an employee refuses to permit the employer to take his temperature or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 2)\n\nUnder the circumstances existing currently, the ADA allows an employer to bar an employee from physical presence in the workplace if he refuses to have his temperature taken or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19. To gain the cooperation of employees, however, employers may wish to ask the reasons for the employee\u2019s refusal. The employer may be able to provide information or reassurance that they are taking these steps to ensure the safety of everyone in the workplace, and that these steps are consistent with health screening recommendations from CDC. Sometimes, employees are reluctant to provide medical information because they fear an employer may widely spread such personal medical information throughout the workplace. The ADA prohibits such broad disclosures. Alternatively, if an employee requests reasonable accommodation with respect to screening, the usual accommodation process should be followed; this is discussed in Question G.7.\n\nA.12. During the COVID-19 pandemic, may an employer request information from employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, who report feeling ill or who call in sick?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 6)\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time employers may ask employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, and report feeling ill or who call in sick, questions about their symptoms as part of workplace screening for COVID-19.\n\nA.13. May an employer ask an employee why he or she has been absent from work?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 15)\n\nYes. Asking why an individual did not report to work is not a disability-related inquiry. An employer is always entitled to know why an employee has not reported for work.\n\nA.14. When an employee returns from travel during a pandemic, must an employer wait until the employee develops COVID-19 symptoms to ask questions about where the person has traveled?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 8)\n\nNo. Questions about where a person traveled would not be disability-related inquiries. If the CDC or state or local public health officials recommend that people who visit specified locations remain at home for a certain period of time, an employer may ask whether employees are returning from these locations, even if the travel was personal.\n\nB. Confidentiality of Medical Information\n\nWith limited exceptions, the ADA requires employers to keep confidential any medical information they learn about any applicant or employee.\n\nMedical information includes not only a diagnosis or treatments, but also the fact that an individual has requested or is receiving a reasonable accommodation.\n\nB.1. May an employer store in existing medical files information it obtains related to COVID-19, including the results of taking an employee's temperature or the employee's self-identification as having this disease, or must the employer create a new medical file system solely for this information?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nThe ADA requires that all medical information about a particular employee be stored separately from the employee's personnel file, thus limiting access to this\n\nconfidential information\n\n. An employer may store all medical information related to COVID-19 in existing medical files. This includes an employee's statement that he has the disease or suspects he has the disease, or the employer's notes or other documentation from questioning an employee about symptoms.\n\nB.2. If an employer requires all employees to have a daily temperature check before entering the workplace, may the employer maintain a log of the results?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes. The employer needs to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\n\nB.3. May an employer disclose the name of an employee to a public health agency when it learns that the employee has COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes\n\n.\n\nB.4. May a temporary staffing agency or a contractor that places an employee in an employer's workplace notify the employer if it learns the employee has COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes. The staffing agency or contractor may notify the employer and disclose the name of the employee, because the employer may need to determine if this employee had contact with anyone in the workplace.\n\nB.5. Suppose a manager learns that an employee has COVID-19, or has symptoms associated with the disease. The manager knows she must report it but is worried about violating ADA confidentiality. What should she do?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 5)\n\nThe ADA requires that an employer keep all medical information about employees confidential, even if that information is not about a disability. Clearly, the information that an employee has symptoms of, or a diagnosis of, COVID-19, is medical information. But the fact that this is medical information does not prevent the manager from reporting to appropriate employer officials so that they can take actions consistent with guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities.\n\nThe question is really what information to report: is it the fact that an employee\u2014unnamed\u2014has symptoms of COVID-19 or a diagnosis, or is it the identity of that employee? Who in the organization needs to know the identity of the employee will depend on each workplace and why a specific official needs this information. Employers should make every effort to limit the number of people who get to know the name of the employee.\n\nThe ADA does not interfere with a designated representative of the employer interviewing the employee to get a list of people with whom the employee possibly had contact through the workplace, so that the employer can then take action to notify those who may have come into contact with the employee, without revealing the employee\u2019s identity. For example, using a generic descriptor, such as telling employees that \u201csomeone at this location\u201d or \u201csomeone on the fourth floor\u201d has COVID-19, provides notice and does not violate the ADA\u2019s prohibition of disclosure of confidential medical information.\n\nFor small employers, coworkers might be able to figure out who the employee is, but employers in that situation are still prohibited from confirming or revealing the employee\u2019s identity. Also, all employer officials who are designated as needing to know the identity of an employee should be specifically instructed that they must maintain the confidentiality of this information. Employers may want to plan in advance what supervisors and managers should do if this situation arises and determine who will be responsible for receiving information and taking next steps.\n\nB.6. An employee who must report to the workplace knows that a coworker who reports to the same workplace has symptoms associated with COVID-19. Does ADA confidentiality prevent the first employee from disclosing the coworker's symptoms to a supervisor?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 6)\n\nNo. ADA confidentiality does not prevent this employee from communicating to his supervisor about a coworker\u2019s symptoms. In other words, it is not an ADA confidentiality violation for this employee to inform his supervisor about a coworker\u2019s symptoms. After learning about this situation, the supervisor should contact appropriate management officials to report this information and discuss next steps.\n\nB.7. An employer knows that an employee is teleworking because the person has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, and that he is in self-quarantine. May the employer tell staff that this particular employee is teleworking without saying why?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 7)\n\nYes. If staff need to know how to contact the employee, and that the employee is working even if not present in the workplace, then disclosure that the employee is teleworking without saying why is permissible. Also, if the employee was on leave rather than teleworking because he has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, or any other medical condition, then an employer cannot disclose the reason for the leave, just the fact that the individual is on leave.\n\nB.8. Many employees, including managers and supervisors, are now teleworking as a result of COVID-19. How are they supposed to keep medical information of employees confidential while working remotely?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 9)\n\nThe ADA requirement that medical information be kept confidential includes a requirement that it be stored separately from regular personnel files. If a manager or supervisor receives medical information involving COVID-19, or any other medical information, while teleworking, and is able to follow an employer\u2019s existing confidentiality protocols while working remotely, the supervisor has to do so. But to the extent that is not feasible, the supervisor still must safeguard this information to the greatest extent possible until the supervisor can properly store it. This means that paper notepads, laptops, or other devices should not be left where others can access the protected information.\n\nSimilarly, documentation must not be stored electronically where others would have access. A manager may even wish to use initials or another code to further ensure confidentiality of the name of an employee.\n\nC. Hiring and Onboarding\n\nUnder the ADA, prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category.\n\nC.1.\n\nIf an employer is hiring, may it screen applicants for symptoms of COVID-19?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. An employer may screen job applicants for symptoms of COVID-19 after making a conditional job offer, as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same type of job. This ADA rule applies whether or not the applicant has a disability.\n\nC.2.\n\nMay an employer take an applicant's temperature as part of a post-offer, pre-employment medical exam?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. Any medical exams are permitted after an employer has made a conditional offer of employment. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\n\nC.3.\n\nMay an employer delay the start date of an applicant\n\nwho has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. According to current CDC guidance, an individual who has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it should not be in the workplace.\n\nC.4.\n\nMay an employer withdraw a job offer whe\n\nn it needs the applicant to start immediately but the individual has COVID-19 or symptoms of it?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nBased on current CDC guidance, this individual cannot safely enter the workplace, and therefore the employer may withdraw the job offer.\n\nC.5. May an employer postpone the start date or withdraw a job offer because the individual is 65 years old or pregnant, both of which place them at higher risk from COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nNo. The fact that the CDC has identified those who are 65 or older, or pregnant women, as being at greater risk does not justify unilaterally postponing the start date or withdrawing a job offer. However, an employer may choose to allow telework or to discuss with these individuals if they would like to postpone the start date.\n\nD. Reasonable Accommodation\n\nUnder the ADA, reasonable accommodations are adjustments or modifications provided by an employer to enable people with disabilities to enjoy equal employment opportunities. If a reasonable accommodation is needed and requested by an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform a job, or enjoy benefits and privileges of employment, the employer must provide it unless it would pose an undue hardship, meaning significant difficulty or expense. An employer has the discretion to choose among effective accommodations. Where a requested accommodation would result in undue hardship, the employer must offer an alternative accommodation if one is available absent undue hardship. In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website for types of accommodations,\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n. JAN's materials specific to COVID-19 are at\n\nhttps://askjan.org/topics/COVID-19.cfm\n\n.\n\nD.1. If a job may only be performed at the workplace, are there\n\nreasonable accommodations\n\nfor individuals with disabilities, absent\n\nundue hardship\n\n,\n\nthat could offer protection to an employee who, due to a preexisting disability, is at higher risk from COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nThere may be reasonable accommodations that\n\ncould offer protection to an individual whose disability puts him at greater risk from COVID-19\n\nand who therefore requests such actions to eliminate possible exposure. Even with the constraints imposed by a pandemic, some accommodations may meet an employee's needs on a temporary basis without causing undue hardship on the employer.\n\nLow-cost solutions achieved with materials already on hand or easily obtained may be effective. If not already implemented for all employees, accommodations for those who request reduced contact with others due to a disability may include changes to the work environment such as designating one-way aisles; using plexiglass, tables, or other barriers to ensure minimum distances between customers and coworkers whenever feasible per\n\nCDC guidance\n\nor other accommodations that reduce chances of exposure.\n\nFlexibility by employers and employees is important in determining if some accommodation is possible in the circumstances. Temporary job restructuring of marginal job duties, temporary transfers to a different position, or modifying a work schedule or shift assignment may also permit an individual with a disability to perform safely the essential functions of the job while reducing exposure to others in the workplace or while commuting.\n\nD.2. If an employee has a preexisting mental illness or disorder that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, may he now be entitled to a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship)?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAlthough many people feel significant stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees with certain preexisting mental health conditions, for example, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, may have more difficulty handling the disruption to daily life that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs with any accommodation request, employers may: ask questions to determine whether the condition is a disability; discuss with the employee how the requested accommodation would assist him and enable him to keep working; explore alternative accommodations that may effectively meet his needs; and request medical documentation if needed.\n\nD.3. In a workplace where all employees are required to telework during this time, should an employer postpone discussing a request from an employee with a disability for an accommodation that will not be needed until he returns to the workplace when mandatory telework ends?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nNot necessarily. An employer may give higher priority to discussing requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed while teleworking, but the employer may begin discussing this request now. The employer may be able to acquire all the information it needs to make a decision. If a reasonable accommodation is granted, the employer also may be able to make some arrangements for the accommodation in advance.\n\nD.4. What if an employee was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and now requests an additional or altered accommodation?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAn employee who was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be entitled to an additional or altered accommodation, absent undue hardship. For example, an employee who is teleworking because of the pandemic may need a different type of accommodation than what he\n\nuses in the workplace\n\n. The employer\n\nmay discuss\n\nwith the employee whether the same or a different disability is the basis for this new request and why an additional or altered accommodation is needed.\n\nD.5. During the pandemic, if an employee requests an accommodation for a medical condition either at home or in the workplace, may an employer still request information to determine if the condition is a disability?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee has a \"disability\" as defined by the ADA (a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, or a history of a substantially limiting impairment).\n\nD.6. During the pandemic, may an employer still engage in the interactive process and request information from an employee about why an accommodation is needed?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request\n\nmedical documentation\n\nto determine whether the employee's disability necessitates an accommodation, either the one he requested or any other.\n\nPossible questions\n\nfor the employee may include: (1) how the disability creates a limitation, (2) how the requested accommodation will effectively address the limitation, (3) whether another form of accommodation could effectively address the issue, and (4) how a proposed accommodation will enable the employee to continue performing the \"essential functions\" of his position (that is, the fundamental job duties).\n\nD.7. If there is some urgency to providing an accommodation, or the employer has limited time available to discuss the request during the pandemic, may an employer provide a temporary accommodation?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. Given the pandemic, some employers may choose to forgo or shorten the exchange of information between an employer and employee known as the \"interactive process\" (discussed in D.5 and D.6., above) and grant the request. In addition, when government restrictions change, or are partially or fully lifted, the need for accommodations may also change. This may result in more requests for short-term accommodations. Employers may wish to adapt the interactive process\u2014and devise end dates for the accommodation\u2014to suit changing circumstances based on public health directives.\n\nWhatever the reason for shortening or adapting the interactive process, an employer may also choose to place an end date on the accommodation (for example, either a specific date such as May 30, or when the employee returns to the workplace part- or full-time due to changes in government restrictions limiting the number of people who may congregate). Employers may also opt to provide a requested accommodation on an interim or trial basis, with an end date, while awaiting receipt of medical documentation. Choosing one of these alternatives may be particularly helpful where the requested accommodation would provide protection that an employee may need because of a pre-existing disability that puts her at greater risk during this pandemic. This\n\ncould also apply\n\nto employees who have disabilities exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nEmployees may request an extension that an employer must consider, particularly if current government restrictions are extended or new ones adopted.\n\nD.8. May an employer invite employees now to ask for reasonable accommodations they may need in the future when they are permitted to return to the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20; updated 9/8/20 to address stakeholder questions)\n\nYes. Employers may inform the workforce that employees with disabilities may request accommodations in advance that they believe they may need when the workplace re-opens. This is discussed in greater detail in Question G.6. If advance requests are received, employers may begin the \"interactive process\" \u2013 the discussion between the employer and employee focused on whether the impairment is a disability and the reasons that an accommodation is needed. If an employee chooses not to request accommodation in advance, and instead requests it at a later time, the employer must still consider the request at that time.\n\nD.9. Are the circumstances of the pandemic relevant to whether a requested accommodation can be denied because it poses an undue hardship?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. An employer does not have to provide a particular reasonable accommodation if it poses an \"\n\nundue hardship\n\n,\" which means \"significant difficulty or expense.\" As described in the two questions that follow, in some instances, an accommodation that would not have posed an undue hardship prior to the pandemic may pose one now.\n\nD.10. What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \"significant difficulty\" during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nAn employer may consider whether current circumstances create \"significant difficulty\" in acquiring or providing certain accommodations, considering the facts of the particular job and workplace. For example, it may be significantly more difficult in this pandemic to conduct a needs assessment or to acquire certain items, and delivery may be impacted, particularly for employees who may be teleworking. Or, it may be significantly more difficult to provide employees with temporary assignments, to remove marginal functions, or to readily hire temporary workers for specialized positions. If a particular accommodation poses an undue hardship, employers and employees should work together to determine if there may be an alternative that could be provided that does not pose such problems.\n\nD.11. What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \"significant expense\" during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most accommodations did not pose a significant expense when considered against an employer's overall budget and resources (always considering the budget/resources of the entire entity and not just its components). But, the sudden loss of some or all of an employer's income stream because of this pandemic is a relevant consideration. Also relevant is the amount of discretionary funds available at this time\u2014when considering other expenses\u2014and whether there is an expected date that current restrictions on an employer's operations will be lifted (or new restrictions will be added or substituted). These considerations do not mean that an employer can reject any accommodation that costs money; an employer must weigh the cost of an accommodation against its current budget while taking into account constraints created by this pandemic. For example, even under current circumstances, there may be many no-cost or very low-cost accommodations.\n\nD.12. Do the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to applicants or employees who are classified as \u201c\n\ncritical infrastructure workers\n\n\u201d or \u201c\n\nessential critical workers\n\n\u201d by the CDC?\n\n(4/23/20)\n\nYes. These CDC designations, or any other designations of certain employees, do not eliminate coverage under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, or any other equal employment opportunity law. Therefore, employers receiving requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act from employees falling in these categories of jobs must accept and process the requests as they would for any other employee. Whether the request is granted will depend on whether the worker is an individual with a disability, and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be provided absent undue hardship.\n\nD.13. Is an employee entitled to an accommodation under the ADA in order to avoid exposing a family member who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nNo. Although the ADA prohibits discrimination based on association with an individual with a disability, that protection is limited to disparate treatment or harassment. The ADA does not require that an employer accommodate an employee without a disability based on the disability-related needs of a family member or other person with whom she is associated.\n\nFor example, an employee without a disability is not entitled under the ADA to telework as an accommodation in order to protect a family member with a disability from potential COVID-19 exposure.\n\nOf course, an employer is free to provide such flexibilities if it chooses to do so. An employer choosing to offer additional flexibilities beyond what the law requires should be careful not to engage in disparate treatment on a protected EEO basis.\n\nD.14. When an employer requires some or all of its employees to telework because of COVID-19 or government officials require employers to shut down their facilities and have workers telework, is the employer required to provide a teleworking employee with the same reasonable accommodations for disability under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that it provides to this individual in the workplace?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 20\n\n)\n\nIf such a request is made, the employer and employee should discuss what the employee needs and why, and whether the same or a different accommodation could suffice in the home setting. For example, an employee may already have certain things in their home to enable them to do their job so that they do not need to have all of the accommodations that are provided in the workplace.\n\nAlso, the undue hardship considerations might be different when evaluating a request for accommodation when teleworking rather than working in the workplace. A reasonable accommodation that is feasible and does not pose an undue hardship in the workplace might pose one when considering circumstances, such as the place where it is needed and the reason for telework. For example, the fact that the period of telework may be of a temporary or unknown duration may render certain accommodations either not feasible or an undue hardship. There may also be constraints on the normal availability of items or on the ability of an employer to conduct a necessary assessment.\n\nAs a practical matter, and in light of the circumstances that led to the need for telework, employers and employees should both be creative and flexible about what can be done when an employee needs a reasonable accommodation for telework at home. If possible, providing interim accommodations might be appropriate while an employer discusses a request with the employee or is waiting for additional information.\n\nD.15. Assume that an employer grants telework to employees for the purpose of slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19. When an employer reopens the workplace and recalls employees to the worksite, does the employer automatically have to grant telework as a reasonable accommodation to every employee with a disability who requests to continue this arrangement as an ADA/Rehabilitation Act accommodation?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 21)\n\nNo. Any time an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer is entitled to understand the disability-related limitation that necessitates an accommodation. If there is no disability-related limitation that requires teleworking, then the employer does not have to provide telework as an accommodation. Or, if there is a disability-related limitation but the employer can effectively address the need with another form of reasonable accommodation at the workplace, then the employer can choose that alternative to telework.\n\nTo the extent that an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID-19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions, then a request\u2014after the workplace reopens\u2014to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function. The ADA never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability.\n\nThe fact that an employer temporarily excused performance of one or more essential functions when it closed the workplace and enabled employees to telework for the purpose of protecting their safety from COVID-19, or otherwise chose to permit telework, does not mean that the employer permanently changed a job\u2019s essential functions, that telework is always a feasible accommodation, or that it does not pose an undue hardship. These are fact-specific determinations. The employer has no obligation under the ADA to refrain from restoring all of an employee\u2019s essential duties at such time as it chooses to restore the prior work arrangement, and then evaluating any requests for continued or new accommodations under the usual ADA rules.\n\nD.16. Assume that prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employee with a disability had requested telework as a reasonable accommodation. The employee had shown a disability-related need for this accommodation, but the employer denied it because of concerns that the employee would not be able to perform the essential functions remotely. In the past, the employee therefore continued to come to the workplace. However, after the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and temporary telework ends, the employee renews her request for telework as a reasonable accommodation. Can the employer again refuse the request?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 22)\n\nAssuming all the requirements for such a reasonable accommodation are satisfied, the temporary telework experience could be relevant to considering the renewed request. In this situation, for example, the period of providing telework because of the COVID-19 pandemic could serve as a trial period that showed whether or not this employee with a disability could satisfactorily perform all essential functions while working remotely, and the employer should consider any new requests in light of this information. As with all accommodation requests, the employee and the employer should engage in a flexible, cooperative interactive process going forward if this issue does arise.\n\nD.17. Might the pandemic result in excusable delays during the interactive process?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 19)\n\nYes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has disrupted normal work routines and may have resulted in unexpected or increased requests for reasonable accommodation. Although employers and employees should address these requests as soon as possible, the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delay in discussing requests and in providing accommodation where warranted. Employers and employees are encouraged to use interim solutions to enable employees to keep working as much as possible.\n\nD.18. Federal agencies are required to have timelines in their written reasonable accommodation procedures governing how quickly they will process requests and provide reasonable accommodations. What happens if circumstances created by the pandemic prevent an agency from meeting this timeline?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 19)\n\nSituations created by the current COVID-19 crisis may constitute an \u201cextenuating circumstance\u201d\u2014something beyond a Federal agency\u2019s control\u2014that may justify exceeding the normal timeline that an agency has adopted in its internal reasonable accommodation procedures.\n\nE. Pandemic-Related Harassment Due to National Origin, Race, or Other Protected Characteristics\n\nE.1. What practical tools are available to employers to reduce and address workplace harassment that may arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nEmployers can help reduce the chance of harassment by explicitly communicating to the workforce that fear of the COVID-19 pandemic should not be misdirected against individuals because of a protected characteristic, including their\n\nnational origin, race\n\n, or other prohibited bases.\n\nPractical anti-harassment tools provided by the EEOC for small businesses can be found here:\n\nAnti-harassment\n\npolicy tips\n\nfor small businesses\n\nSelect Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace (includes detailed recommendations and tools to aid in designing effective anti-harassment policies; developing training curricula; implementing complaint, reporting, and investigation procedures; creating an organizational culture in which harassment is not tolerated):\n\nreport\n\n;\n\nchecklists\n\nfor employers who want to reduce and address harassment in the workplace; and\n\nchart\n\nof risk factors that lead to harassment and appropriate responses.\n\nE.2. Are there steps an employer should take to address possible harassment and discrimination against coworkers when it re-opens the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. An employer may remind all employees that it is against the federal EEO laws to harass or otherwise discriminate against coworkers based on race, national origin, color, sex, religion, age (40 or over), disability, or genetic information. It may be particularly helpful for employers to advise supervisors and managers of their roles in watching for, stopping, and reporting any harassment or other discrimination. An employer may also make clear that it will immediately review any allegations of harassment or discrimination and take appropriate action.\n\nE.3. How may employers respond to pandemic-related harassment, in particular against employees who are or are perceived to be Asian?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nManagers should be alert to demeaning, derogatory, or hostile remarks directed to employees who are or are perceived to be of Chinese or other Asian national origin, including about the coronavirus or its origins.\n\nAll employers covered by Title VII should ensure that management understands in advance how to recognize such harassment. Harassment may occur using electronic communication tools\u2014regardless of whether employees are in the workplace, teleworking, or on leave\u2014and also in person between employees at the worksite. Harassment of employees at the worksite may also originate with contractors, customers or clients, or, for example, with patients or their family members at health care facilities, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Managers should know their legal obligations and be\n\ninstructed\n\nto quickly identify and resolve potential problems, before they rise to the level of unlawful discrimination.\n\nEmployers may choose to send a reminder to the entire workforce noting Title VII\u2019s prohibitions on harassment, reminding employees that harassment will not be tolerated, and inviting anyone who experiences or witnesses workplace harassment to report it to management. Employers may remind employees that harassment can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nE.4. An employer learns that an employee who is teleworking due to the pandemic is sending harassing emails to another worker. What actions should the employer take?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThe employer should take the same actions it would take if the employee was in the workplace. Employees may not harass other employees through, for example, emails, calls, or platforms for video or chat communication and collaboration.\n\nF. Furloughs and Layoffs\n\nF.1. Under the EEOC's laws, what waiver responsibilities apply when an employer is conducting layoffs?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nSpecial rules apply when an employer is offering employees severance packages in exchange for a general release of all discrimination claims against the employer. More information is available in EEOC's\n\ntechnical assistance document on severance agreements\n\n.\n\nF.2. What are additional EEO considerations in planning furloughs or layoffs?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 13)\n\nThe laws enforced by the EEOC prohibit covered employers from selecting people for furlough or layoff because of that individual\u2019s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, protected genetic information, or in retaliation for protected EEO activity.\n\nG. Return to Work\n\nG.1. As government stay-at-home orders and other restrictions are modified or lifted in your area, how will employers know what steps they can take consistent with the ADA to screen employees for COVID-19 when entering the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nThe ADA permits employers to make disability-related inquiries and conduct medical exams if job-related and consistent with business necessity. Inquiries and reliable medical exams meet this standard if it is necessary to exclude employees with a medical condition that would pose a direct threat to health or safety.\n\nDirect threat is to be determined based on the best available objective medical evidence. The guidance from CDC or other public health authorities is such evidence. Therefore, employers will be acting consistent with the ADA as long as any screening implemented is consistent with advice from the CDC and public health authorities for that type of workplace at that time.\n\nFor example, this may include continuing to take temperatures and asking questions about symptoms (or require self-reporting)\n\nof all those entering the workplace\n\n. Similarly, the CDC recently posted\n\ninformation\n\non return by certain types of critical workers.\n\nEmployers should make sure not to engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in decisions related to screening and exclusion.\n\nG.2. An employer requires returning workers to wear personal protective gear and engage in infection control practices. Some employees ask for accommodations due to a need for modified protective gear. Must an employer grant these requests?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nAn employer may require employees to wear\n\nprotective gear\n\n(for example, masks and gloves) and observe\n\ninfection control practices\n\n(for example, regular hand washing and social distancing protocols).\n\nHowever, where an employee with a disability needs a related reasonable accommodation under the ADA (e.g., non-latex gloves, modified face masks for interpreters or others who communicate with an employee who uses lip reading, or gowns designed for individuals who use wheelchairs), or a religious accommodation under Title VII (such as modified equipment due to religious garb), the employer should discuss the request and provide the modification or an alternative if feasible and not an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business under the ADA or Title VII.\n\nG.3. What does an employee need to do in order to request reasonable accommodation from her employer because she has one of the\n\nmedical conditions\n\nthat CDC says may put her at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\n\n(5/5/20)\n\nAn employee\u2014or a third party, such as an employee\u2019s doctor\u2014must\n\nlet the employer know\n\nthat she needs a change for a reason related to a medical condition (here, the underlying condition). Individuals may request accommodation in conversation or in writing. While the employee (or third party) does not need to use the term \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d or reference the ADA, she may do so.\n\nThe employee or her representative should communicate that she has a medical condition that necessitates a change to meet a medical need. After receiving a request, the employer may\n\nask questions or seek medical documentation\n\nto help decide if the individual has a disability and if there is a reasonable accommodation, barring\n\nundue hardship\n\n, that can be provided.\n\nG.4. The CDC identifies a number of medical conditions that might place individuals at\n\n\u201chigher risk for severe illness\u201d\n\nif they get COVID-19. An employer knows that an employee has one of these conditions and is concerned that his health will be jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, but the employee has not requested accommodation. How does the ADA apply to this situation?\n\n(5/7/20)\n\nFirst, if the employee does not request a reasonable accommodation, the ADA does not mandate that the employer take action.\n\nIf the employer is concerned about the employee\u2019s health being jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, the ADA does not allow the employer to exclude the employee\u2014or take any other adverse action\u2014\n\nsolely\n\nbecause the employee has a disability that the CDC identifies as potentially placing him at \u201chigher risk for severe illness\u201d if he gets COVID-19. Under the ADA, such action is not allowed unless the employee\u2019s disability poses a \u201cdirect threat\u201d to his health that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\n\nThe ADA direct threat requirement is a high standard. As an affirmative defense, direct threat requires an employer to show that the individual has a disability that poses a \u201csignificant risk of substantial harm\u201d to his own health under\n\n29 C.F.R. section 1630.2(r)\n\n(regulation addressing direct threat to health or safety of self or others). A direct threat assessment cannot be based solely on the condition being on the CDC\u2019s list; the determination must be an individualized assessment based on a reasonable medical judgment about this employee\u2019s disability\u2014not the disability in general\u2014using the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. The ADA regulation requires an employer to consider the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. Analysis of these factors will likely include considerations based on the severity of the pandemic in a particular area and the employee\u2019s own health (for example, is the employee\u2019s disability well-controlled), and his particular job duties. A determination of direct threat also would include the likelihood that an individual will be exposed to the virus at the worksite. Measures that an employer may be taking in general to protect all workers, such as mandatory social distancing, also would be relevant.\n\nEven if an employer determines that an employee\u2019s disability poses a direct threat to his own health, the employer still cannot exclude the employee from the workplace\u2014or take any other adverse action\u2014unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship). The ADA regulations require an employer to consider whether there are reasonable accommodations that would eliminate or reduce the risk so that it would be safe for the employee to return to the workplace while still permitting performance of essential functions. This can involve an interactive process with the employee. If there are not accommodations that permit this, then an employer must consider accommodations such as telework, leave, or reassignment (perhaps to a different job in a place where it may be safer for the employee to work or that permits telework). An employer may only bar an employee from the workplace if, after going through all these steps, the facts support the conclusion that the employee poses a significant risk of substantial harm to himself that cannot be reduced or eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\n\nG.5. What are examples of accommodation that, absent undue hardship, may eliminate (or reduce to an acceptable level) a direct threat to self?\n\n(5/5/20)\n\nAccommodations\n\nmay include additional or enhanced protective gowns, masks, gloves, or other gear beyond what the employer may generally provide to employees returning to its workplace. Accommodations also may include additional or enhanced protective measures, for example, erecting a barrier that provides separation between an employee with a disability and coworkers/the public or increasing the space between an employee with a disability and others. Another possible reasonable accommodation may be elimination or substitution of particular \u201cmarginal\u201d functions (less critical or incidental job duties as distinguished from the \u201cessential\u201d functions of a particular position). In addition, accommodations may include temporary modification of work schedules (if that decreases contact with coworkers and/or the public when on duty or commuting) or moving the location of where one performs work (for example, moving a person to the end of a production line rather than in the middle of it if that provides more social distancing).\n\nThese are only a few ideas. Identifying an effective accommodation depends, among other things, on an employee\u2019s job duties and the design of the workspace. An employer and employee should discuss possible ideas; the Job Accommodation Network (\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n) also may be able to assist in helping identify possible accommodations. As with all discussions of reasonable accommodation during this pandemic, employers and employees are encouraged to be creative and flexible.\n\nG.6. As a best practice, and in advance of having some or all employees return to the workplace, are there ways for an employer to invite employees to request flexibility in work arrangements?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nYes. The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act permit employers to make information available in advance to\n\nall\n\nemployees about who to contact\u2014if they wish\u2014to request accommodation for a disability that they may need upon return to the workplace, even if no date has been announced for their return. If requests are received in advance, the employer may begin the\n\ninteractive process\n\n. An employer may choose to include in such a notice all the CDC-listed medical conditions that may place people at higher risk of serious illness if they contract COVID-19, provide instructions about who to contact, and explain that the employer is willing to consider on a case-by-case basis any requests from employees who have these or other medical conditions.\n\nAn employer also may send a general notice to all employees who are designated for returning to the workplace, noting that the employer is willing to consider requests for accommodation or flexibilities on an individualized basis. The employer should specify if the contacts differ depending on the reason for the request \u2013 for example, if the office or person to contact is different for employees with disabilities or pregnant workers than for employees whose request is based on age or child-care responsibilities.\n\nEither approach is consistent with the ADEA, the ADA, and the May 29, 2020\n\nCDC guidance\n\nthat emphasizes the importance of employers providing accommodations or flexibilities to employees who, due to age or certain medical conditions, are at higher risk for severe illness.\n\nRegardless of the approach, however, employers should ensure that whoever receives inquiries knows how to handle them consistent with the different federal employment nondiscrimination laws that may apply, for instance, with respect to accommodations due to a medical condition, a religious belief, or pregnancy.\n\nG.7. What should an employer do if an employee entering the worksite requests an alternative method of screening due to a medical condition?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThis is a request for reasonable accommodation, and an employer should proceed as it would for any other request for accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. If the requested change is easy to provide and inexpensive, the employer might voluntarily choose to make it available to anyone who asks, without going through an interactive process. Alternatively, if the disability is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask the employee for information to establish that the condition is a\n\ndisability\n\nand what specific limitations require an accommodation. If necessary, an employer also may request medical documentation to support the employee\u2019s request, and then determine if that accommodation or an alternative effective accommodation can be provided, absent undue hardship.\n\nSimilarly, if an employee requested an alternative method of screening as a religious accommodation, the employer should determine if accommodation is\n\navailable under Title VII\n\n.\n\nH. Age\n\nH.1. The\n\nCDC has explained\n\nthat individuals age 65 and over are at higher risk for a severe case of COVID-19 if they contract the virus and therefore has encouraged employers to offer maximum flexibilities to this group. Do employees age 65 and over have protections under the federal employment discrimination laws?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals age 40 and older. The ADEA would prohibit a covered employer from involuntarily excluding an individual from the workplace based on his or her being 65 or older, even if the employer acted for benevolent reasons such as protecting the employee due to higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nUnlike the ADA, the ADEA does not include a right to reasonable accommodation for older workers due to age. However, employers are free to provide flexibility to workers age 65 and older; the ADEA does not prohibit this, even if it results in younger workers ages 40-64 being treated less favorably based on age in comparison.\n\nWorkers age 65 and older also may have medical conditions that bring them under the protection of the ADA as individuals with disabilities. As such, they may request reasonable\n\naccommodation for their disability\n\nas opposed to their age.\n\nH.2. If an employer is choosing to offer flexibilities to other workers, may older comparable workers be treated less favorably based on age?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 12)\n\nNo. If an employer is allowing other comparable workers to telework, it should make sure it is not treating older workers less favorably based on their age.\n\nI. Caregivers/Family Responsibilities\n\nI.1. If an employer provides telework, modified schedules, or other benefits to employees with school-age children due to school closures or distance learning during the pandemic, are there sex discrimination considerations?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nEmployers may provide any flexibilities as long as they are not treating employees differently based on sex or other EEO-protected characteristics. For example, under Title VII, female employees cannot be given more favorable treatment than male employees because of a gender-based assumption about who may have\n\ncaretaking responsibilities\n\nfor children.\n\nJ. Pregnancy\n\nJ.1. Due to the pandemic, may an employer exclude an employee from the workplace involuntarily\n\ndue to pregnancy\n\n?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nNo. Sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act includes discrimination based on pregnancy. Even if motivated by benevolent concern, an employer is not permitted to single out workers on the basis of pregnancy for adverse employment actions, including involuntary leave, layoff, or furlough.\n\nJ.2.\n\nIs there a right to accommodation based on pregnancy during the pandemic?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThere are two federal employment discrimination laws that may trigger\n\naccommodation for employees based on pregnancy\n\n.\n\nFirst, pregnancy-related medical conditions may themselves be disabilities under the ADA, even though pregnancy itself is not an ADA disability. If an employee makes a request for reasonable accommodation due to a pregnancy-related medical condition, the employer must consider it under the usual ADA rules.\n\nSecond, Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifically requires that women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions be treated the same as others who are similar in their ability or inability to work. This means that a pregnant employee may be entitled to job modifications, including telework, changes to work schedules or assignments, and leave to the extent provided for other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work. Employers should ensure that supervisors, managers, and human resources personnel know how to handle such requests to avoid disparate treatment in violation of Title VII.\n\nK. Vaccinations\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccinations may raise questions about the applicablilty of various equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws, including the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, GINA, and Title VII, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (see\n\nSection J, EEO rights relating to pregnancy\n\n).\u00a0 The EEO laws do not interfere with or prevent employers from following CDC or other federal, state, and local public health authorities\u2019 guidelines and suggestions.\n\nADA and Vaccinations\n\nK.1. For any COVID-19 vaccine that has been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine to an employee by an employer (or by a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine) a \u201cmedical examination\u201d for purposes of the ADA?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo. \u00a0The vaccination itself is not a medical examination.\u00a0 As the Commission explained in\n\nguidance on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations\n\n, a medical examination is \u201ca procedure or test usually given by a health care professional or in a medical setting that seeks information about an individual\u2019s physical or mental impairments or health.\u201d\u00a0 Examples include \u201cvision tests; blood, urine, and breath analyses; blood pressure screening and cholesterol testing; and diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs.\u201d \u00a0If a vaccine is administered to an employee by an employer for protection against contracting COVID-19, the employer is not seeking information about an individual\u2019s impairments or current health status and, therefore, it is not a medical examination.\n\nAlthough the administration of a vaccination is not a medical examination, pre-screening vaccination questions may implicate the ADA\u2019s provision on disability-related inquiries, which are inquiries likely to elicit information about a disability.\u00a0 If the employer administers the vaccine, it must show that such pre-screening questions it asks employees are \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d\n\nSee Question K.2\n\n.\n\nK.2. According to the CDC, health care providers should ask certain questions before administering a vaccine to ensure that there is no medical reason that would prevent the person from receiving the vaccination. If the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination from the employer (or a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine) and asks these screening questions, are these questions subject to the ADA standards for disability-related inquiries?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nYes.\u00a0 Pre-vaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about a disability.\u00a0 This means that such questions, if asked by the employer or a contractor on the employer\u2019s behalf, are \u201cdisability-related\u201d under the ADA.\u00a0 Thus, if the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination, administered by the employer, the employer must show that these disability-related screening inquiries are \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d \u00a0To meet this standard, an employer would need to have a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that an employee who does not answer the questions and, therefore, does not receive a vaccination, will pose a direct threat to the health or safety of her or himself or others.\n\nSee Question K.5.\n\nbelow for a discussion of direct threat.\n\nBy contrast, there are two circumstances in which disability-related screening questions can be asked without needing to satisfy the \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d requirement.\u00a0 First, if an employer has offered a vaccination to employees on a voluntary basis (i.e. employees choose whether to be vaccinated), the ADA requires that the employee\u2019s decision to answer pre-screening, disability-related questions also must be voluntary.\n\n42 U.S.C. 12112(d)(4)(B)\n\n;\n\n29 C.F.R. 1630.14(d)\n\n. \u00a0If an employee chooses not to answer these questions, the employer may decline to administer the vaccine but may not retaliate against, intimidate, or threaten the employee for refusing to answer any questions. \u00a0Second, if an employee receives an employer-required vaccination from a third party that does not have a contract with the employer, such as a pharmacy or other health care provider, the ADA \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d restrictions on disability-related inquiries would not apply to the pre-vaccination medical screening questions.\n\nThe ADA requires employers to keep any employee medical information obtained in the course of the vaccination program\n\nconfidential\n\n.\n\nK.3. Is asking or requiring an employee to show proof of receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination a disability-related inquiry?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo.\u00a0 There are many reasons that may explain why an employee has not been vaccinated, which may or may not be disability-related.\u00a0 Simply requesting proof of receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination is not likely to elicit information about a disability and, therefore, is not a disability-related inquiry.\u00a0 However, subsequent employer questions, such as asking why an individual did not receive a vaccination, may elicit information about a disability and would be subject to the pertinent ADA standard that they be \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d\u00a0 If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination from a pharmacy or their own health care provider, the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide any medical information as part of the proof in order to avoid implicating the ADA.\n\nADA and Title VII Issues Regarding Mandatory Vaccinations\n\nK.4. Where can employers learn more about Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) of COVID-19 vaccines?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nSome COVID-19 vaccines may only be available to the public for the foreseeable future under EUA granted by the FDA, which is different than approval under FDA vaccine licensure. The\n\nFDA has an obligation\n\nto:\n\n[E]nsure that recipients of the vaccine under an EUA are informed, to the extent practicable under the applicable circumstances, that FDA has authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, of the known and potential benefits and risks, the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown, that they have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine, and of any available alternatives to the product.\n\nThe FDA says that this information is typically conveyed in a patient fact sheet that is provided at the time of the vaccine administration and that it posts the fact sheets on its website.\u00a0 More information about EUA vaccines is available on the\n\nFDA\u2019s EUA page\n\n.\n\nK.5. If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available, how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccination because of a disability?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nThe ADA allows an employer to have a\n\nqualification standard\n\nthat includes \u201ca requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace.\u201d \u00a0However, if a safety-based qualification standard, such as a vaccination requirement, screens out or tends to screen out an individual with a disability, the employer must show that an unvaccinated employee would pose a direct threat due to a \u201csignificant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\u201d\n\n29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r)\n\n.\u00a0 Employers should conduct an individualized assessment of four factors in determining whether a direct threat exists: the duration of the risk; the nature and severity of the potential harm; the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and the imminence of the potential harm.\u00a0 A conclusion that there is a direct threat would include a determination that an unvaccinated individual will expose others to the virus at the worksite. \u00a0If an employer determines that an individual who cannot be vaccinated due to disability poses a direct threat at the worksite, the employer cannot exclude the employee from the workplace\u2014or take any other action\u2014unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent\n\nundue hardship\n\n) that would eliminate or reduce this risk so the unvaccinated employee does not pose a direct threat.\n\nIf there is a direct threat that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level,\n\nthe employer can exclude\n\nthe employee from physically entering the workplace, but this does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker.\u00a0 Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state, and local authorities. \u00a0For example, if an employer excludes an employee based on an inability to accommodate a request to be exempt from a vaccination requirement, the employee may be entitled to accommodations such as performing the current position remotely. This is the same step that employers take when physically excluding employees from a worksite due to a current COVID-19 diagnosis or symptoms; some workers may be entitled to telework or, if not, may be eligible to take leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, under the FMLA, or under the employer\u2019s policies.\n\nSee also\n\nSection J, EEO rights relating to pregnancy\n\n.\n\nManagers and supervisors responsible for communicating with employees about compliance with the employer\u2019s vaccination requirement should know how to recognize an accommodation request from an employee with a disability and know to whom the request should be referred for consideration. \u00a0Employers and employees should engage in a flexible, interactive process to identify workplace accommodation options that do not constitute an undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense). \u00a0This process should include determining whether it is necessary to obtain supporting documentation about the employee\u2019s disability and considering the possible options for accommodation given the nature of the workforce and the employee\u2019s position.\u00a0 The prevalence in the workplace of employees who already have received a COVID-19 vaccination and the amount of contact with others, whose vaccination status could be unknown, may impact the undue hardship consideration.\u00a0 In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees also may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website as a resource for different types of accommodations,\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n. \u00a0JAN\u2019s materials specific to COVID-19 are at\n\nhttps://askjan.org/topics/COVID-19.cfm\n\n.\n\nEmployers may rely on CDC recommendations when deciding whether an effective accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship is available, but as explained further in\n\nQuestion K.7.\n\n, there may be situations where an accommodation is not possible.\u00a0 When an employer makes this decision, the facts about particular job duties and workplaces may be relevant.\u00a0 Employers also should consult applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and guidance.\u00a0 Employers can find OSHA COVID-specific resources at:\n\nwww.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/\n\n.\n\nManagers and supervisors are reminded that it is unlawful to disclose that an employee is receiving a reasonable accommodation or retaliate against an employee for\n\nrequesting an accommodation\n\n.\n\nK.6. If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available, how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccination because of a sincerely held religious practice or belief?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nOnce an employer is on notice that an employee\u2019s sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance prevents the employee from receiving the vaccination, the employer must provide a reasonable accommodation for the religious belief, practice, or observance unless it would pose an undue hardship under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\u00a0 Courts have defined \u201cundue hardship\u201d under\n\nTitle VII\n\nas having more than a\n\nde minimis\n\ncost or burden on the employer. EEOC guidance explains that because the definition of religion is broad and protects beliefs, practices, and observances with which the employer may be unfamiliar, the employer should ordinarily assume that an employee\u2019s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief. \u00a0If, however, an employee requests a religious accommodation, and an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, practice, or observance, the employer would be justified in requesting additional supporting information.\n\nK.7. What happens if an employer cannot exempt or provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee who cannot comply with a mandatory vaccine policy because of a disability or sincerely held religious practice or belief?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nIf an employee cannot get vaccinated for COVID-19 because of a disability or sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, and there is no reasonable accommodation possible, then it would be lawful for the employer to\n\nexclude\n\nthe employee from the workplace. \u00a0This does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker.\u00a0 Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state, and local authorities.\n\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and Vaccinations\n\nK.8. Is Title II of GINA implicated when an employer administers a COVID-19 vaccine to employees or requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo. Administering a COVID-19 vaccination to employees or requiring employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination does not implicate Title II of GINA because it does not involve the use of genetic information to make employment decisions, or the acquisition or disclosure of \u201cgenetic information\u201d as defined by the statute. This includes vaccinations that use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which will be discussed more below.\u00a0 As noted in Question K.9. however, if administration of the vaccine requires pre-screening questions that ask about genetic information, the inquiries seeking genetic information, such as family members\u2019 medical histories, may violate GINA.\n\nUnder Title II of GINA, employers may not (1) use genetic information to make decisions related to the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, (2) acquire genetic information except in six narrow circumstances, or (3) disclose genetic information except in six narrow circumstances.\n\nCertain COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology. This raises questions about genetics and, specifically, about whether such vaccines modify a recipient\u2019s genetic makeup and, therefore, whether requiring an employee to get the vaccine as a condition of employment is an unlawful use of genetic information. \u00a0The CDC has explained that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines \u201cdo not interact with our DNA in any way\u201d and \u201cmRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.\u201d (See\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html\n\nfor a detailed discussion about how mRNA vaccines work).\u00a0 Thus, requiring employees to get the vaccine, whether it uses mRNA technology or not, does not violate GINA\u2019s prohibitions on using, acquiring, or disclosing genetic information.\n\nK.9. Does asking an employee the pre-vaccination screening questions before administering a COVID-19 vaccine implicate Title II of GINA?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nPre-vaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about disability, as discussed in\n\nQuestion K.2.\n\n, and may elicit information about genetic information, such as questions regarding the immune systems of family members.\u00a0 It is not yet clear what screening checklists for contraindications will be provided with COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nGINA defines \u201cgenetic information\u201d to mean:\n\nInformation about an individual\u2019s genetic tests;\n\nInformation about the genetic tests of a family member;\n\nInformation about the manifestation of disease or disorder in a family member (i.e., family medical history);\n\nInformation about requests for, or receipt of, genetic services or the participation in clinical research that includes genetic services by the an individual or a family member of the individual; and\n\nGenetic information about a fetus carried by an individual or family member or of an embryo legally held by an individual or family member using assisted reproductive technology.\n\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1635.3(c).\u00a0 If the pre-vaccination questions do\n\nnot\n\ninclude any questions about genetic information (including family medical history), then asking them does not implicate GINA.\u00a0 However, if the pre-vaccination questions\n\ndo\n\ninclude questions about genetic information, then employers who want to ensure that employees have been vaccinated may want to request proof of vaccination instead of administering the vaccine themselves.\n\nGINA does not prohibit an individual employee\u2019s own health care provider from asking questions about genetic information, but it does prohibit an employer or a doctor working for the employer from asking questions about genetic information.\u00a0 If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination from their own health care provider, the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide genetic information as part of the proof.\u00a0 As long as this warning is provided, any genetic information the employer receives in response to its request for proof of vaccination will be considered inadvertent and therefore not unlawful under GINA.\n\nSee\n\n29 CFR 1635.8(b)(1)(i) for model language that can be used for this warning.\n\nReturn to top\n\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\nEEOC Headquarters\n\n131 M Street, NE\n\nWashington, DC 20507\n\n202-663-4900 / (TTY) 202-663-4494\n\nQuestions?\n\nCall 1-800-669-4000\n\nFor Deaf/Hard of Hearing callers:\n\n1-800-669-6820 (TTY)\n\n1-844-234-5122 (ASL Video Phone)\n\ninfo@eeoc.gov\n\nFind your nearest EEOC office\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nSign up for email or text updates\n\nConnect With Us\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nRSS\n\nFOIA\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAccessibility\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\nUSA.gov\n",

In particular:\n\n1 \u00a0 \u00a0does not represent the entire life cycle analysis (LCA) or supply chain of livestock products, notably omitting carbon dioxide production in respiration (on average 4.8 tons CO2 e/year/cow, 2.3 CO2 e/year/pig, etc.), provides no consideration for increased indirect radiative effects of methane on atmospheric aerosols and particulate capture related to smog (Shindell et al. 2009), and manages land use changes (LUC) with admitted \u201cuncertainty\u201d and under-counting/reporting\n\n2 \u00a0 \u00a0ultimately defers to a separate category for reporting of greenhouse gas emissions related to \u201cdeforestation\u201d (20% of global GHG emissions per UN-REDD), of which livestock and feed crops play a significant role, needing to be added to direct emissions (80% of Amazonian rainforest deforestation and degradation, and destruction of Cerrado savanna since 1970 has been due to expansion for cattle, with another 10% loss due to planting crops to feed them and other livestock)\n\n3 \u00a0 \u00a0the global warming potential (GWP) for methane used in this report was from IPCC 2007, which was 21 at 100 years. However, the GWP of methane is actually 86 GWP at 20 years\n\n4 \u00a0 \u00a0the report gave no consideration to carbon sequestration potential lost on land now used for livestock and feed production, which should have been considered as emissions (45% of the land mass on Earth now used by livestock and crops to feed them\u2013International Livestock Research Institute)\n\n5 \u00a0 \u00a0Consideration should be given to the fact that the lead authors have potential bias in this report; Pierre Gerber is the Livestock Policy Officer of the FAO and Henning Steinfeld is Chief,\u00a0Livestock Information of the Livestock Sector Policy Branch of the FAO. There is little doubt why obvious omissions were therefore seen in their conclusions presented: \u201c\n\nThe global livestock sector is faced with a three-fold challenge: increasing production to meet demand, adapting to a changing and increasingly variable economic and natural environment and, lastly, improving its environmental performance.\n\n\u201c\n\nThis FAO report failed to represent urgency in regard to climate change and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, performed no analysis of alternatives, and failed to present risks versus benefits of raising livestock on a global scale.\n\n1 \u00a0 \u00a0there was no consideration of the effects of raising livestock on continued warming, acidification, deoxygenation and therefore diminished climate regulatory mechanisms of our oceans or time lines related to potential detrimental effects on the oxygen-nitrogen-carbon dioxide cycling capacities.\n\n2 \u00a0 \u00a0the report gave no account for anthropogenic greenhouse gases generated by agricultural systems related to extraction or raising and eating fish\u2013fuel, refrigeration, packaging, processing, transportation, etc. for both wild caught operations as well as those pertaining to aquaculture/aquaponics/aeroponics, which would thereby provide a more accurate and complete agricultural portrait related to our food choices making it easier for policy makers and consumers to interpret the data and findings\n\n3 \u00a0 \u00a0there is no discussion, in an overview sense, to provide clarity regarding the component this happens to represent in livestock\u2019s role, or food choice for that matter, in our current state of un-sustainability and the interrelated issues we face\u2013freshwater scarcity, collapse of sea life oceanic ecosystems, unprecedented extinctions and loss of biodiversity, food security and agricultural land use inefficiencies,\n\nimplications in human health and disease\n\n, rising health care costs and loss of productivity, economic risk factors, questions of social justice and implications regarding future generations, etc. (many of these issues are irreversible in our lifetime)\u2013all part of the task of basic but thorough environmental scientific assessment, perhaps beyond the scope of livestock researchers/proponents for this one report, but the critical connection and relevance are vital should have been mentioned, nevertheless.It is quite clear by this report, which presents a filtered and quite limited view of the role of livestock in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and global depletion, that our team should focus our attention on\n\nwhy\n\nthere is suppression of information, lack of clarity, or elucidation of facts by our leaders related to the overarching problem of animal based agriculture as a component of food choice\u2013and then how to swiftly correct this. Global governmental institutions such as the United Nations and its FAO should examine all the facts and present them accordingly as they interrelate. Then, they should be able to call for the frank elimination (or comprehensive \u201creplacement\u201d) of imminent threats to our survival such as food choices and agricultural systems that are disease promoting, ecologically unsustainable, and which condone massive unnecessary slaughtering\u2013rather than calling for their perpetuation.\n\n[.i] Some have challenged that the 18% of GHG emissions from animal ag cannot be compared to the 13% of GHG for transportation emissions because it does not take into consideration the full lifecycle analysis of the transportation industry. We have made it clear in the film that 13% of GHG emissions only accounts for the exhaust from the worlds vehicles.\n\n[ii]\u00a0Although there are Cornell studies citing the water consumption of the US livestock industry at over\n\n66 trillion gallons every year\n\n, we decided to go with a much more conservative figure of 34 trillion gallons based off the 2005 USGS figures putting the US total consumptive water use at\n\n76 trillion gallons annually\n\n(non-consumptive is for thermoelectric and hydroelectric use that is typically returned directly back to its source immediately). The USDA says that agriculture is responsible for\n\n80-90 percent of US water consumption\n\nand growing the feed crops for livestock consumes\n\n56% of that water\n\n, bringing the total water consumption of the livestock industry to 34 trillion gallons.\n\n[iii]\u00a01 burger = 2 months showering: based on taking a 4-minute daily shower with a 2.5 gpm shower head.\n\n[iv]\u00a0\u201cA typical five-acre hog waste lagoon releases 15-30 tons of ammonia into the air annually. Approximately half of the ammonia rises as a gas and generally falls to forests, fields, or open water within 50 miles, either in rain or fog. The rest is transformed into dry particles that travel up to 250 miles.\n\nAmmonia is the most potent form of nitrogen that triggers algae blooms and causes fish kills in coastal waters. The North Carolina Division of Water Quality estimates that hog factories constitute the largest source of airborne ammonia in North Carolina, more than cattle, chickens, and turkeys combined. In 1995, Hans Paerl, a marine ecologist from the University of North Carolina, reported that airborne ammonia had risen 25% each year since 1991 in Morehead City, 90 miles downwind of the hog belt.\u201d\n\n[v]\u00a0-Dairy Cows,\n\n120 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 9.32 million\n\ndairy cows\n\n-Cows,\n\n63 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 83.68 million\n\ncows\n\n-Calves,\n\n30 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 34.3 million\n\ncalves\n\n-Pigs,\n\n14 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 74 million\n\npigs\n\n-Sheep and Goats,\n\n5 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 7.84 million\n\nsheep and goats\n\n-Turkeys,\n\n.87 lbs. of waster per day\n\nx 77 million\n\nturkeys\n\n-Broiler Chickens,\n\n.50 lbs. of waste per day\n\nx 1.74 billion\n\nbroiler chickens\n\n-Laying Hens,\n\n.25 lbs. of waster per day\n\nx 350.7 million\n\nlaying hens\n\n*pigs are raised twice per year, (a total of 148.3 million per year) so on any given day in the United States there are about 74 million pigs.\n\n*turkeys are raised three times per year (a total of 233 million per year) so on any given day in the United States there are 77 million turkeys.\n\n*broiler chickens are raised 5 times per year, (a total of 8.69 billion per year) so any given day there are1.74 billion broiler chickens.\n\nDairy Cows produce (120 lbs. x 9.32 m.) = 1.1184 billion lbs.\n\nCows produce (63 lbs. x 83.68 m.) = 5.27184 billion lbs.\n\nCalves produce (30 lbs. x 34.3 m.) = 1.029 billion lbs.\n\nPigs produce (14 lbs. x 74.0 m.) = 1.036 billion lbs.\n\nSheep and Goats produce (5 lbs. x 7.84 m.) = 39.2 million lbs.\n\nTurkeys produce (.87 lbs. x 77.0 m.) = 66.99 million lbs.\n\nBroiler Chickens produce (.5 x 1.74 b.) = 870 million lbs.\n\nLaying Hens produce (.25 x 350.7 m.) = 87.675 million lbs.\n\n*Total manure produced in one day is 9.519105 billion lbs.\n\n*Total manure produced in one year is 3.475 trillion lbs.\n\n*This is the equivalent of over 6.611 million lbs. per minute.

A farm with 2500 dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of 411,000 people.\u201d\n\nOn a 1000-pound live weight basis, each of these animals produces more waste than a human. A CAFO with 1000 animal units of turkeys produces a waste load comparable to a city of 87,700 people. A dairy CAFO with 1000 animal units is equivalent to a city of 164,500 people. The important difference lies in the fact that human waste is treated before discharge into the environment, but animal waste is either not treated at all or minimally treated by virtue of the storage methods used before disposal.\u201d\n\nhttp://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901V0100.txt\n\n[vii]\u00a0Additionally \u2013 Oppenlander says 1-2 trillion fish extracted (inc. \u201cbycatch,\u201d) from our oceans each year (\u201cby fishing methods such as trawling, purse seine, long lines, explosives, and other techniques that are damaging ecosystems\u201d)\n\nhttp://comfortablyunaware.com/blog/biodiversity-and-food-choice-a-clarification/\n\n[viii]\u00a0The figures for by-kill rates can be as high as 20lbs of untargeted species trapped for every pound of targeted animals killed.\n\n[ix]\u00a0\u201cThe USDA currently forecasts 2013/14 palm oil production\u2026total area devoted to oil palm plantings is estimated at a record 10.8 million hectares.\u201d [26.7 million acres]\n\n[x]\u00a0\u201c[Dorothy Stang\u2019s] death prompted Amazon activists \u2013 more than 1,000 of whom have been murdered in the last 20 years \u2013 to demand Brazil\u2019s government crack down on the illegal seizure and clearance of the rainforest to graze cattle, raise soy crops, and harvest timber.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than 1,100 activists, small farmers, judges, priests and other rural workers have been killed in land disputes in the last two decades.\u201d\n\n[xi]\u00a0A single cow can produce between 66-132 gallons of methane a day. The average US vehicle gas tank can hold about 16 gallons of gas.\n\n[xii]\u00a0\u201cThe US meat industry produced some 1.4 billion tons of waste in 1997\u2014 five tons of animal waste for every US citizen. (USDA)\u201dhttp://www.worldwatch.org/fire-grill-mouthwatering-red-white-and-green-july-4th\n\n[xiv]\u00a0The average person in the U.S. uses 405,000 gallons of freshwater per year (combination of the subfractions which comprise 206 pounds of meat per year\u2013 divided between 46 pounds of pig, 58 pounds of cow, 102 pounds of chicken and turkey in addition to 248 eggs and 616 pounds of dairy products), which equates to saving 1,100 gallons of water each day.\n\n\u2013 45lbs of grain saved per day: Grain: multiply ounces of each meat consumed daily per person by the feed conversion factor for each animal.\n\n\u2013 It is estimated that 80,000 acres of rainforest are cleared each day with an additional 80,000 degraded, with\n\n70-91% of that degradation for the livestock industry\n\n.\n\n\u2013 CO2 based of feed conversion ratios and the average US meat consumption of 209lbs per year, per person.\n\nBeef is at 22-27 kg CO2 Eq per kg produced/consumed X 2.5 ounces/day=1.75 kgor 3.85 pounds\n\nCheese/milk is 13.5 kg per kg product X 2 pounds/day=12.15 kg or 12.5 pounds\n\nPork is 12 kg per kg product X 2 ounces/day=.68 kg or 1.5 pounds\n\nCombination chicken and turkey is 7 kg per kg product X 4.48 ounces/day= .89 kg or 1.96 pounds minimally (using only chicken)\n\n{turkey, for instance, is 11 kg per kg product}\n\nEggs are at 5 kg per kg product X 2/3 egg per day= (50 g/egg) .55 pounds\n\n\u2014\u00a0which equals 20.36 pounds of CO2 Eq saved per day.\n\n[xv] An important distinction must be made between water \"use\" and \"consumption\".\u00a0Hydroelectric power is one of the largest \"users\" of water in the US, but actually consumes very little water. The water is used to power turbines or for cooling and is almost always returned to the source immediately. Agriculture is the largest \"consumer\" of water because it pulls water from the source and locks it up in products, not returning it to the source immediately, if ever.\n\n[xvi] \u00a0$414 billion of externalized costs breaks down to:\u00a0$314 billion in health-care costs,\u00a0$38 billion in subsides,\u00a0$37 billion in environmental costs,\u00a0$21 billion in cruelty costs,\u00a0$4 billion in fishing-related costs.

Additionally, using any agricultural database regionally, nationally, or internationally, one can calculate that on average between 10 times and 100 times (in weight) more plant foods (vegetables, fruit, grain/nuts) on one acre of land than from animal products raised on that same acre of land, regardless of the level of fertility of that particular acre of land, presuming it is the same acre used for either product, animal or plant based.\n\n[xviii]\u00a0Many organizations are studying humanity\u2019s effect on soil degradation, erosion, and eventual desertification but not willing to emphasize the final connection of dots to animal agriculture. According to the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), nearly 20 million acres of arable land is lost each year due to desertification and the primary reasons are:\n\n1. deforestation due to cultivation of crops and pasture\n\n2. overgrazing from livestock (\u201ceating away grasses and eroding topsoil with hooves\u201d)\n\n3. intensive farming stripping away nutrients in soil\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/background.shtml\n\nOvergrazing by livestock is the principal land problem related to desertification as indicated in the article:\n\nhttp://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-186/002-186.html\n\nAnd, according to the UNDDD: \u201cNearly 20% of the degrading land (globally) is cropland, and 20-25%, rangeland.\u201d Understanding that over 70% of the global arable land used for agriculture is planted for crops grown for livestock, there is be ample support for the statement that \u201canimal agriculture is the leading driver for approximately 1/3 of the land lost on earth due to desertification.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/events/desertification_decade/whynow.shtml\n\n[xix]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Few prominent scientists will openly proclaim the connection of their research findings with the need to eliminate animal agriculture or promotion of fully plant based nutrition. This is an observation that spans all aspects of global depletion related to food choice, including the topic of loss of biodiversity and extinction of species.\n\nThe statement that animal agriculture is the primary driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of species is supported by many discussions and interviews with leading authors and scientists working for the Convention of Biodiversity and IUCN as well as publications regarding current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook.\n\nMost organizations that associate their work with species and ecosystem/biodiversity concerns as well as the scientific community as a whole believe that the six main threats to our oceans are climate change, overfishing, predator loss, pollution, destruction of habitat, and bycatch, (\u201cbykill\u201d).\n\n(For instance: The Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union and the Convention on Biological Diversity).\n\nAs of August 2012, the 2004 Global Species Assessment was the most recent empirical data on global extinction rates, based on birds, mammals, and amphibians. According to an interview conducted by Dr. Oppenlander with Simon Stuart, PhD, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission:\n\n\u201cHabitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species, impacting 86 percent of all mammals, 88 percent of amphibians, and 86 percent of all birds. One in every eight birds, one in every three amphibians, and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future. Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction, such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land, globally.\u201d\n\nThe Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction.\n\nScientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial \u201cecoregions\u201d (as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions), each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species, as well as climate. Of all these land ecoregions, almost half are reported by lead scientists (interviews/discussions) to have livestock as a current threat. The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that \u201cmost of the world\u2019s endangered or threatened species\u201d on their Red List (which lists the species that are most endangered) are suffering habitat loss due to livestock\u2014not due to agriculture but to livestock.\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity, held in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met. The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species\u2014habitat change, overexploitation, pollution, invasive species, and climate change\u2014were all increasing in intensity.\n\nCurrent biodiversity assessments (as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the IUCN Red List, and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook) now generally agree that land use change,\u00a0modification of river flow, freshwater pollution, and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species.\u00a0Because more than 50% of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock (ILRI), 70 to 90% of freshwater pollution in western countries (particularly the U.S. and China) can be traced back to animal agriculture, minimally 14.5% of anthropogenic GHG emissions/climate change, and 100% of \u201cexploitation of marine environments\u201d is related to the global commercial fishing industry, it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that \u201cthe primary driver of global species\u2019 extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture.\u201d\n\n[xx] The amount of water, land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed, amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised.\u00a0Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat, the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods. The same applies for land and oil use. Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50+ acre per cow, compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50,000lbs+ per acre.\u00a0The energy/fuel inputs are similar. 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans.\n\nxxi (New) As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67,027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45,000. However the BLM considers the amount of wild horses and burros on the range too populated and will attempt to remove 40,000 to bring the level back to what is considered by the BLM the 'acceptable level'\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates from A.U.M.
