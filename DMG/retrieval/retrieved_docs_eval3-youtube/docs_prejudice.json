Berlin Olympic Games were more than just a worldwide sporting event, they were a show of Nazi propaganda, stirring significant conflict. Despite the exclusionary principles of the 1936 Games, countries around the world still agreed to participate.\n\nKey Facts\n\n1\n\nNazi Germany used the 1936 Olympic Games for propaganda purposes. The Nazis promoted an image of a new, strong, and united Germany while masking the regime\u2019s targeting of Jews and Roma (Gypsies) as well as Germany\u2019s growing militarism.\n\n2\n\nFor the first time in the history of the modern Olympic Games, people in the United States and Europe called for a boycott of the Olympics because of what would later become known as human rights abuses. Although the movement ultimately failed, it set an important precedent for future Olympic boycott campaigns (such as those in 2008 and 2014).\n\n3\n\nOnce the boycott movement narrowly failed, Germany had its propaganda coup: the 49 nations who sent teams to the Games legitimized the Hitler regime both in the eyes of the world and of German domestic audiences.\n\nMore information about this image\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nCite\n\nPrint\n\nTags\n\nOlympics\n\npropaganda\n\nNazi rise to power\n\nBerlin\n\nathletes and sports\n\nThird Reich\n\nboycotts\n\nEnglish\n\nThis content is available in the following languages\n\n\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\n\n\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\n\n\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\n\nMagyar\n\nBahasa Indonesia\n\nItaliano\n\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\n\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\nPortugu\u00eas do Brasil\n\n\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\n\u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u0648\n\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\nFran\u00e7ais\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936\n\nFor two weeks in August 1936,\n\nAdolf Hitler\n\n's Nazi dictatorship camouflaged its racist, militaristic character while hosting the Summer Olympics. Softpedaling its\n\nantisemitic\n\nagenda and plans for territorial expansion, the\n\nregime\n\nexploited the Games to bedazzle many foreign spectators and journalists with an image of a peaceful, tolerant Germany.\n\nHaving rejected a proposed\n\nboycott\n\nof the 1936 Olympics, the sponsoring athletic and Olympic organizations of the United States and other western democracies missed the opportunity to take a stand that\u2014some observers at the time claimed\u2014might have given Hitler pause and bolstered international resistance to Nazi tyranny.\n\nWith the conclusion of the Games, Germany's expansionist policies and the persecution of Jews and other \"enemies of the state\" accelerated, culminating in\n\nWorld War II\n\nand the\n\nHolocaust\n\n.\n\nThe 1936 Summer Olympic Games\n\nIn 1931, the International Olympic Committee awarded the 1936 Summer Olympics to Berlin. The choice signaled Germany's return to the world community after its isolation in the aftermath of defeat in\n\nWorld War I\n\n.\n\nTwo years later, Nazi party leader Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany and quickly turned the nation's fragile democracy into a one-party dictatorship that persecuted Jews, Roma (Gypsies), all political opponents, and others. The Nazi claim to control all aspects of German life also extended to sports.\n\nGerman sports imagery of the 1930s served to promote the myth of \u201cAryan\u201d racial superiority and physical prowess. In sculpture and in other forms, German artists idealized athletes' well-developed muscle tone and heroic strength and accentuated ostensibly Aryan facial features. Such imagery also reflected the importance the Nazi regime placed on physical fitness, a prerequisite for military service.\n\nExclusion from German Sports\n\nIn April 1933, an \"Aryans only\" policy was instituted in all German athletic organizations. \"Non-Aryans\"\u2014Jews or individuals with Jewish parents and\n\nRoma\n\n(Gypsies)\u2014were systematically excluded from German sports facilities and associations. The German Boxing Association expelled professional light heavyweightchampion Erich Seelig in April 1933 because he was Jewish. (Seelig later resumed his boxing career in the United States.) Another Jewish athlete, Daniel Prenn\u2014Germany's top-ranked tennis player\u2014was removed from Germany's Davis Cup Team. Gretel Bergmann, a world-class high jumper, was expelled from her German club in 1933 and from the German Olympic team in 1936.\n\nJewish athletes barred from German sports clubs flocked to separate Jewish associations, including the Maccabee and Shield groups, and to improvised segregated facilities. But these Jewish sports facilities were not comparable to well-funded German groups. Roma (Gypsies), including the Sinti boxer Johann Rukelie Trollmann, were also excluded from German sports.\n\nJewish Athletes\n\nAs a token gesture to placate international opinion, German authorities allowed the star fencer Helene Mayer to represent Germany at the Olympic Games in Berlin. Mayer was viewed as a \u201cnon-Aryan\u201d because her father was Jewish. She won a silver medal in women's individual fencing and, like all other medalists for Germany, gave the Nazi salute on the podium. No other Jewish athlete competed for Germany in the Summer Games.\n\nStill, nine athletes who were Jewish or of Jewish parentage won medals in the Nazi Olympics, including Mayer and five Hungarians. Seven Jewish male athletes from the United States went to Berlin. Like some of the European Jewish competitors at the Olympics, many of these young men were pressured by Jewish organizations to boycott the Games. These athletes chose to compete for a variety of reasons. Most did not fully grasp at the time the extent and purpose of Nazi persecution of Jews and other groups.\n\nIn August 1936, the Nazi regime tried to camouflage its violent\n\nracist\n\npolicies while it hosted the Summer Olympics. Most anti-Jewish signs were temporarily removed and newspapers toned down their harsh rhetoric, in line with directives from the Propaganda Ministry, headed by Joseph Goebbels. Thus, the regime exploited the Olympic Games to present foreign spectators and journalists with a false image of a peaceful, tolerant Germany.\n\nBoycott Movements\n\nMovements to boycott the 1936 Berlin Olympics surfaced in the United States, Great Britain, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands. Debate over participation in the 1936 Olympics was most intense in the United States, which traditionally sent one of the largest teams to the Games. Some boycott proponents supported counter-Olympics. One of the largest was the \"People's Olympiad\" planned for the summer of 1936 in Barcelona, Spain. It was canceled after the outbreak of the\n\nSpanish Civil War\n\nin July 1936, just as thousands of athletes had begun to arrive.\n\nIndividual Jewish athletes from a number of countries also chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics or Olympic qualifying trials. In the United States, some Jewish athletes and Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee supported a boycott, as did a number of liberal Catholic politicians and many college presidents. However, once the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States opted in a close vote to participate in December 1935, other countries fell in line and the boycott movement failed.\n\nPreparation for the Games\n\nThe Nazis made elaborate preparations for the August 1\u201316 Summer Games. A huge sports complex was constructed, including a new stadium and state-of-the art Olympic village for housing the athletes. Olympic flags and swastikas bedecked the monuments and houses of a festive, crowded Berlin.\n\nMost tourists were unaware that the Nazi regime had temporarily removed anti-Jewish signs, nor would they have known of a police roundup of Roma in Berlin, ordered by the German Ministry of the Interior. On July 16, 1936, some 800 Roma residing in Berlin and its environs were arrested and interned under police guard in a special camp in the Berlin suburb of Marzahn.\n\nNazi officials also ordered that foreign visitors should not be subjected to the criminal penalties of German\n\nanti-homosexuality laws\n\n.\n\nOpening of the Games\n\nOn August 1, 1936, Hitler opened the\n\nXIth Olympiad\n\n. Musical fanfares directed by the famous composer Richard Strauss announced the dictator's arrival to the largely German crowd. Hundreds of athletes in opening day regalia marched into the stadium, team by team in alphabetical order. Inaugurating a new Olympic ritual, a lone runner arrived bearing a torch carried by relay from the site of the ancient Games in Olympia, Greece.\n\nForty-nine athletic teams from around the world competed in the Berlin Olympics, more than in any previous Olympics. Germany fielded the largest team with 348 athletes. The US team was the second largest, with 312 members, including 18\n\nAfrican Americans\n\n. American Olympic Committee President Avery Brundage led the delegation. The Soviet Union did not participate in the Berlin Games (or any Olympics until the 1952 Helskinki Games when many politicians, journalists, and competitors regarded the Olympics as an important battle in the Cold War).\n\nPropaganda\n\nGermany skillfully promoted the Olympics with colorful posters and magazine spreads. Athletic imagery drew a link between Nazi Germany and ancient Greece, symbolizing the Nazi racial myth that a superior German civilization was the rightful heir of an \"Aryan\" culture of classical antiquity. This vision of classical antiquity emphasized ideal \"Aryan\" racial types: heroic, blue-eyed blonds with finely chiseled features.\n\nConcerted\n\npropaganda\n\nefforts continued well after the Olympics with the international release in 1938 of\n\nOlympia\n\n, the controversial documentary directed by German filmmaker\n\nLeni Riefenstahl\n\n. Renowned for her earlier propaganda film,\n\nTriumph of the Will\n\n(1934) depicting Nazi Party rallies at Nuremberg, Riefenstahl was commissioned by the Nazi regime to produce this film about the 1936 Summer Games.\n\nGerman Victories\n\nGermany emerged victorious from the XIth Olympiad. German athletes captured the most medals, and German hospitality and organization won the praises of visitors. Most newspaper accounts echoed the\n\nNew York Times\n\nreport that the Games put Germans \"back in the fold of nations,\" and even made them \"more human again.\" Some even found reason to hope that this peaceable interlude would endure. Only a few reporters, such as the American\n\nWilliam Shirer\n\n, understood that the Berlin glitter was merely a facade hiding a racist and oppressively violent regime.\n\nAfter the Games\n\nAs post-Games reports were filed, Hitler pressed on with grandiose plans for German expansion. Persecution of Jews resumed. Two days after the Olympics, Captain Wolfgang Fuerstner, head of the Olympic village, killed himself when he was dismissed from military service because of his Jewish ancestry.\n\nGermany invaded Poland\n\non September 1, 1939. Within just three years of the Olympiad, the \"hospitable\" and \"peaceable\" sponsor of the Games unleashed World War II, a conflict that resulted in untold destruction. With the conclusion of the Games, Germany's expansionist policies and the persecution of Jews and other \"enemies of the state\" accelerated, culminating in the Holocaust.\n\nAuthor(s):\n\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, DC\n\nSee Also\n\nMedia Gallery\n\nThe Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936\n\nRelated Links\n\nOnline Exhibition: The Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936\n\nLesson Plan: Black Americans and the Nazi Olympics (PDF)\n\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum Library bibliography: 1936 Olympics\n\nTeaching Materials on Propaganda\n\nThe Nazi Olympics: Jewish Athletes (video, 10m 59s)\n\nGlossary Terms\n\nSeries:\n\n1936 Olympics\n\n1\n\nThe Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936\n\n2\n\nThe Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936: Inauguration of the Olympic Torch Relay\n\n3\n\nThe Movement to Boycott the Berlin Olympics of 1936\n\n4\n\nThe Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936: African American Voices and \"Jim Crow\" America\n\nCritical Thinking Questions\n\nWhat political purposes might be served by hosting the Olympics?\n\nSince 1945, when have Olympics events or participation been affected by political beliefs or actions?\n\nFeedback\n\nThank you for supporting our work\n\nWe would like to thank Crown Family Philanthropies and the Abe and Ida Cooper Foundation for supporting the ongoing work to create content and resources for the Holocaust Encyclopedia.\n\nView the list of all donors\n\n.\n\n100 Raoul Wallenberg Place, SW\n\nWashington, DC 20024-2126\n\nMain telephone: 202.488.0400\n\nTTY: 202.488.0406\n\nGet the Latest News\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\nCurrent Exhibitions\n\nCalendar of Events\n\nSupport the Museum\n\nDonate\n\nLearn\n\nTeach\n\nCollections\n\nAcademic Research\n\nRemember Survivors and Victims\n\nGenocide Prevention\n\nAntisemitism and Holocaust Denial\n\nOutreach\n\nHolocaust Encyclopedia\n\nCollections Search\n\nHolocaust Survivors and Victims Resource Center\n\nHistory Unfolded\n\nExperiencing History\n\nEarly Warning Project\n\nABOUT THE MUSEUM\n\nCONTACT THE MUSEUM\n\nTERMS OF USE\n\nPRIVACY\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\nLEGAL\n",

Note: Other federal laws, as well as state or local laws, may provide employees with additional protections.\n\nTitle I of the ADA applies to private employers with 15 or more employees. It also applies to state and local government employers, employment agencies, and labor unions. All nondiscrimination standards under Title I of the ADA also apply to federal agencies under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. Basic background information about the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is available on EEOC's\n\ndisability page\n\n.\n\nThe EEO laws, including the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, continue to apply during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they do not interfere with or prevent employers from following the\n\nguidelines and suggestions made by the CDC or state/local public health authorities\n\nabout steps employers should take regarding COVID-19.\n\nEmployers should remember that guidance from public health authorities is likely to change as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Therefore, employers should continue to follow the most current information on maintaining workplace safety.\n\nMany common workplace inquiries about the COVID-19 pandemic are addressed in the CDC publication \u201c\n\nGeneral Business Frequently Asked Questions\n\n.\u201d\n\nThe EEOC has provided guidance (a publication entitled\n\nPandemic Preparedness in the Workplace and the Americans With Disabilities Act\n\n[\n\nPDF version\n\n]) (\"Pandemic Preparedness\"), consistent with these workplace protections and rules, that can help employers implement strategies to navigate the impact of COVID-19 in the workplace. This pandemic publication, which was written during the prior H1N1 outbreak, is still relevant today and identifies established ADA and Rehabilitation Act principles to answer questions frequently asked about the workplace during a pandemic. It has been updated as of March 19, 2020 to address examples and information regarding COVID-19;\n\nthe new 2020 information appears in bold and is marked with an asterisk\n\n.\n\nOn March 27, 2020 the EEOC provided a webinar (\"3/27/20 Webinar\") which was recorded and transcribed and is available at\n\nwww.eeoc.gov/coronavirus\n\n. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 to be an international pandemic. The EEOC pandemic publication includes a\n\nseparate section\n\nthat answers common employer questions about what to do after a pandemic has been declared. Applying these principles to the COVID-19 pandemic, the following may be useful:\n\nA. Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Exams\n\nThe ADA has restrictions on when and how much medical information an employer may obtain from any applicant or employee. Prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category. Once an employee begins work, any disability-related inquiries or medical exams must be job related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nA.1.\n\nHow much information may an employer request from an employee who calls in sick, in order to protect the rest of its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nDuring a pandemic, ADA-covered employers may ask such employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus. For COVID-19, these include symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat. Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.\n\nA.2. When screening employees entering the workplace during this time, may an employer only ask employees about the COVID-19 symptoms EEOC has identified as\n\nexamples\n\n, or may it ask about any symptoms identified by public health authorities as associated with COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAs public health authorities and doctors learn more about COVID-19, they may expand the list of associated symptoms. Employers should rely on the CDC, other public health authorities, and reputable medical sources for guidance on emerging symptoms associated with the disease. These sources may guide employers when choosing questions to ask employees to determine whether they would pose a direct threat to health in the workplace. For example, additional symptoms beyond fever or cough may include new loss of smell or taste as well as gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.\n\nA.3.\n\nWhen may an ADA-covered employer take the body temperature of employees during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nGenerally, measuring an employee's body temperature is a medical examination. Because the CDC and state/local health authorities have acknowledged community spread of COVID-19 and issued attendant precautions, employers may measure employees' body temperature. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\n\nA.4.\n\nDoes the ADA allow employers to require employees to stay home if they have symptoms of the COVID-19?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nYes. The CDC states that employees who become ill with symptoms of COVID-19 should leave the workplace. The ADA does not interfere with employers following this advice.\n\nA.5.\n\nWhen employees return to work, does the ADA allow employers to require a doctor's note certifying fitness for duty?\n\n(3/17/20)\n\nYes. Such inquiries are permitted under the ADA either because they would not be disability-related or, if the pandemic were truly severe, they would be justified under the ADA standards for disability-related inquiries of employees. As a practical matter, however, doctors and other health care professionals may be too busy during and immediately after a pandemic outbreak to provide fitness-for-duty documentation. Therefore, new approaches may be necessary, such as reliance on local clinics to provide a form, a stamp, or an e-mail to certify that an individual does not have the pandemic virus.\n\nA.6. May an employer administer a COVID-19 test (a test to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus)\n\nwhen evaluating an employee\u2019s initial or continued presence in the workplace?\n\n(4/23/20; updated 9/8/20 to address stakeholder questions about updates to CDC guidance)\n\nThe ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be \u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d Applying this standard to the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers may take screening steps to determine if\n\nemployees entering the workplace have COVID-19\n\nbecause\n\nan individual with the virus will pose a direct threat\n\nto the health of others. Therefore an employer may choose to administer COVID-19 testing to employees before initially permitting them to enter the workplace and/or periodically to determine if their presence in the workplace poses a direct threat to others. The ADA does not interfere with employers following\n\nrecommendations by the CDC\n\nor other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate. Testing administered by employers consistent with current CDC guidance will meet the ADA\u2019s \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d standard.\n\nConsistent with the ADA standard, employers should ensure that the tests are considered accurate and reliable. For example, employers may review\n\ninformation\n\nfrom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about what may or may not be considered safe and accurate testing, as well as guidance from CDC or other public health authorities. Because the CDC and FDA may revise their recommendations based on new information, it may be helpful to check these agency websites for updates. Employers may wish to consider the incidence of false-positives or false-negatives associated with a particular test. Note that a positive test result reveals that an individual most likely has a current infection and may be able to transmit the virus to others. A negative test result means that the individual did not have detectable COVID-19 at the time of testing.\n\nA negative test does not mean the employee will not acquire the virus later. Based on guidance from medical and public health authorities, employers should still require\u2013to the greatest extent possible\u2013that employees observe infection control practices (such as social distancing, regular handwashing, and other measures) in the workplace to prevent transmission of COVID-19.\n\nNote: Question A.6 and A.8 address screening of employees generally. See Question A.9 regarding decisions to screen individual employees.\n\nA.7. CDC said in its\n\nInterim Guidelines\n\nthat antibody test results \u201cshould not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace.\u201d In light of this CDC guidance, under the ADA may an employer require antibody testing before permitting employees to re-enter the workplace?\n\n(6/17/20)\n\nNo. An antibody test constitutes a medical examination under the ADA. In light of CDC\u2019s\n\nInterim Guidelines\n\nthat antibody test results \u201cshould not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace,\u201d an antibody test at this time does not meet the ADA\u2019s \u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity\u201d standard for medical examinations or inquiries for current employees. Therefore, requiring antibody testing before allowing employees to re-enter the workplace is not allowed under the ADA. Please note that an antibody test is different from a test to determine if someone has an active case of COVID-19 (i.e., a viral test). The EEOC has already stated that COVID-19 viral tests are\n\npermissible under the ADA\n\n.\n\nThe EEOC will continue to closely monitor CDC\u2019s recommendations, and could update this discussion in response to changes in CDC\u2019s recommendations.\n\nA.8. May employers ask all employees physically entering the workplace if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 1)\n\nYes. Employers may ask all employees who will be physically entering the workplace if they have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19, and ask if they have been tested for COVID-19. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 include, for example, fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. The CDC has identified a\n\ncurrent list of symptoms\n\n.\n\nAn employer may exclude those with COVID-19, or symptoms associated with COVID-19, from the workplace because, as EEOC has stated, their presence would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. However, for those employees who are teleworking and are not physically interacting with coworkers or others (for example, customers), the employer would generally not be permitted to ask these questions.\n\nA.9. May a manager ask only one employee\u2014as opposed to asking all employees\u2014questions designed to determine if she has COVID-19, or require that this employee alone have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 3)\n\nIf an employer wishes to ask only a particular employee to answer such questions, or to have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing, the ADA requires the employer to have a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that this person might have the disease. So, it is important for the employer to consider why it wishes to take these actions regarding this particular employee, such as a display of COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, the ADA does not interfere with employers following\n\nrecommendations by the CDC\n\nor other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate.\n\nA.10. May an employer ask an employee who is physically coming into the workplace whether they have family members who have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 4)\n\nNo. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers from asking employees medical questions about family members. GINA, however, does not prohibit an employer from asking employees whether they have had contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 or who may have symptoms associated with the disease. Moreover, from a public health perspective, only asking an employee about his contact with family members would unnecessarily limit the information obtained about an employee\u2019s potential exposure to COVID-19.\n\nA.11. What may an employer do under the ADA if an employee refuses to permit the employer to take his temperature or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 2)\n\nUnder the circumstances existing currently, the ADA allows an employer to bar an employee from physical presence in the workplace if he refuses to have his temperature taken or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19. To gain the cooperation of employees, however, employers may wish to ask the reasons for the employee\u2019s refusal. The employer may be able to provide information or reassurance that they are taking these steps to ensure the safety of everyone in the workplace, and that these steps are consistent with health screening recommendations from CDC. Sometimes, employees are reluctant to provide medical information because they fear an employer may widely spread such personal medical information throughout the workplace. The ADA prohibits such broad disclosures. Alternatively, if an employee requests reasonable accommodation with respect to screening, the usual accommodation process should be followed; this is discussed in Question G.7.\n\nA.12. During the COVID-19 pandemic, may an employer request information from employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, who report feeling ill or who call in sick?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 6)\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time employers may ask employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, and report feeling ill or who call in sick, questions about their symptoms as part of workplace screening for COVID-19.\n\nA.13. May an employer ask an employee why he or she has been absent from work?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 15)\n\nYes. Asking why an individual did not report to work is not a disability-related inquiry. An employer is always entitled to know why an employee has not reported for work.\n\nA.14. When an employee returns from travel during a pandemic, must an employer wait until the employee develops COVID-19 symptoms to ask questions about where the person has traveled?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 8)\n\nNo. Questions about where a person traveled would not be disability-related inquiries. If the CDC or state or local public health officials recommend that people who visit specified locations remain at home for a certain period of time, an employer may ask whether employees are returning from these locations, even if the travel was personal.\n\nB. Confidentiality of Medical Information\n\nWith limited exceptions, the ADA requires employers to keep confidential any medical information they learn about any applicant or employee.\n\nMedical information includes not only a diagnosis or treatments, but also the fact that an individual has requested or is receiving a reasonable accommodation.\n\nB.1. May an employer store in existing medical files information it obtains related to COVID-19, including the results of taking an employee's temperature or the employee's self-identification as having this disease, or must the employer create a new medical file system solely for this information?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nThe ADA requires that all medical information about a particular employee be stored separately from the employee's personnel file, thus limiting access to this\n\nconfidential information\n\n. An employer may store all medical information related to COVID-19 in existing medical files. This includes an employee's statement that he has the disease or suspects he has the disease, or the employer's notes or other documentation from questioning an employee about symptoms.\n\nB.2. If an employer requires all employees to have a daily temperature check before entering the workplace, may the employer maintain a log of the results?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes. The employer needs to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\n\nB.3. May an employer disclose the name of an employee to a public health agency when it learns that the employee has COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes\n\n.\n\nB.4. May a temporary staffing agency or a contractor that places an employee in an employer's workplace notify the employer if it learns the employee has COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nYes. The staffing agency or contractor may notify the employer and disclose the name of the employee, because the employer may need to determine if this employee had contact with anyone in the workplace.\n\nB.5. Suppose a manager learns that an employee has COVID-19, or has symptoms associated with the disease. The manager knows she must report it but is worried about violating ADA confidentiality. What should she do?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 5)\n\nThe ADA requires that an employer keep all medical information about employees confidential, even if that information is not about a disability. Clearly, the information that an employee has symptoms of, or a diagnosis of, COVID-19, is medical information. But the fact that this is medical information does not prevent the manager from reporting to appropriate employer officials so that they can take actions consistent with guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities.\n\nThe question is really what information to report: is it the fact that an employee\u2014unnamed\u2014has symptoms of COVID-19 or a diagnosis, or is it the identity of that employee? Who in the organization needs to know the identity of the employee will depend on each workplace and why a specific official needs this information. Employers should make every effort to limit the number of people who get to know the name of the employee.\n\nThe ADA does not interfere with a designated representative of the employer interviewing the employee to get a list of people with whom the employee possibly had contact through the workplace, so that the employer can then take action to notify those who may have come into contact with the employee, without revealing the employee\u2019s identity. For example, using a generic descriptor, such as telling employees that \u201csomeone at this location\u201d or \u201csomeone on the fourth floor\u201d has COVID-19, provides notice and does not violate the ADA\u2019s prohibition of disclosure of confidential medical information.\n\nFor small employers, coworkers might be able to figure out who the employee is, but employers in that situation are still prohibited from confirming or revealing the employee\u2019s identity. Also, all employer officials who are designated as needing to know the identity of an employee should be specifically instructed that they must maintain the confidentiality of this information. Employers may want to plan in advance what supervisors and managers should do if this situation arises and determine who will be responsible for receiving information and taking next steps.\n\nB.6. An employee who must report to the workplace knows that a coworker who reports to the same workplace has symptoms associated with COVID-19. Does ADA confidentiality prevent the first employee from disclosing the coworker's symptoms to a supervisor?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 6)\n\nNo. ADA confidentiality does not prevent this employee from communicating to his supervisor about a coworker\u2019s symptoms. In other words, it is not an ADA confidentiality violation for this employee to inform his supervisor about a coworker\u2019s symptoms. After learning about this situation, the supervisor should contact appropriate management officials to report this information and discuss next steps.\n\nB.7. An employer knows that an employee is teleworking because the person has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, and that he is in self-quarantine. May the employer tell staff that this particular employee is teleworking without saying why?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 7)\n\nYes. If staff need to know how to contact the employee, and that the employee is working even if not present in the workplace, then disclosure that the employee is teleworking without saying why is permissible. Also, if the employee was on leave rather than teleworking because he has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, or any other medical condition, then an employer cannot disclose the reason for the leave, just the fact that the individual is on leave.\n\nB.8. Many employees, including managers and supervisors, are now teleworking as a result of COVID-19. How are they supposed to keep medical information of employees confidential while working remotely?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 9)\n\nThe ADA requirement that medical information be kept confidential includes a requirement that it be stored separately from regular personnel files. If a manager or supervisor receives medical information involving COVID-19, or any other medical information, while teleworking, and is able to follow an employer\u2019s existing confidentiality protocols while working remotely, the supervisor has to do so. But to the extent that is not feasible, the supervisor still must safeguard this information to the greatest extent possible until the supervisor can properly store it. This means that paper notepads, laptops, or other devices should not be left where others can access the protected information.\n\nSimilarly, documentation must not be stored electronically where others would have access. A manager may even wish to use initials or another code to further ensure confidentiality of the name of an employee.\n\nC. Hiring and Onboarding\n\nUnder the ADA, prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category.\n\nC.1.\n\nIf an employer is hiring, may it screen applicants for symptoms of COVID-19?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. An employer may screen job applicants for symptoms of COVID-19 after making a conditional job offer, as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same type of job. This ADA rule applies whether or not the applicant has a disability.\n\nC.2.\n\nMay an employer take an applicant's temperature as part of a post-offer, pre-employment medical exam?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. Any medical exams are permitted after an employer has made a conditional offer of employment. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\n\nC.3.\n\nMay an employer delay the start date of an applicant\n\nwho has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nYes. According to current CDC guidance, an individual who has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it should not be in the workplace.\n\nC.4.\n\nMay an employer withdraw a job offer whe\n\nn it needs the applicant to start immediately but the individual has COVID-19 or symptoms of it?\n\n(3/18/20)\n\nBased on current CDC guidance, this individual cannot safely enter the workplace, and therefore the employer may withdraw the job offer.\n\nC.5. May an employer postpone the start date or withdraw a job offer because the individual is 65 years old or pregnant, both of which place them at higher risk from COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nNo. The fact that the CDC has identified those who are 65 or older, or pregnant women, as being at greater risk does not justify unilaterally postponing the start date or withdrawing a job offer. However, an employer may choose to allow telework or to discuss with these individuals if they would like to postpone the start date.\n\nD. Reasonable Accommodation\n\nUnder the ADA, reasonable accommodations are adjustments or modifications provided by an employer to enable people with disabilities to enjoy equal employment opportunities. If a reasonable accommodation is needed and requested by an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform a job, or enjoy benefits and privileges of employment, the employer must provide it unless it would pose an undue hardship, meaning significant difficulty or expense. An employer has the discretion to choose among effective accommodations. Where a requested accommodation would result in undue hardship, the employer must offer an alternative accommodation if one is available absent undue hardship. In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website for types of accommodations,\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n. JAN's materials specific to COVID-19 are at\n\nhttps://askjan.org/topics/COVID-19.cfm\n\n.\n\nD.1. If a job may only be performed at the workplace, are there\n\nreasonable accommodations\n\nfor individuals with disabilities, absent\n\nundue hardship\n\n,\n\nthat could offer protection to an employee who, due to a preexisting disability, is at higher risk from COVID-19?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nThere may be reasonable accommodations that\n\ncould offer protection to an individual whose disability puts him at greater risk from COVID-19\n\nand who therefore requests such actions to eliminate possible exposure. Even with the constraints imposed by a pandemic, some accommodations may meet an employee's needs on a temporary basis without causing undue hardship on the employer.\n\nLow-cost solutions achieved with materials already on hand or easily obtained may be effective. If not already implemented for all employees, accommodations for those who request reduced contact with others due to a disability may include changes to the work environment such as designating one-way aisles; using plexiglass, tables, or other barriers to ensure minimum distances between customers and coworkers whenever feasible per\n\nCDC guidance\n\nor other accommodations that reduce chances of exposure.\n\nFlexibility by employers and employees is important in determining if some accommodation is possible in the circumstances. Temporary job restructuring of marginal job duties, temporary transfers to a different position, or modifying a work schedule or shift assignment may also permit an individual with a disability to perform safely the essential functions of the job while reducing exposure to others in the workplace or while commuting.\n\nD.2. If an employee has a preexisting mental illness or disorder that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, may he now be entitled to a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship)?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAlthough many people feel significant stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees with certain preexisting mental health conditions, for example, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, may have more difficulty handling the disruption to daily life that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs with any accommodation request, employers may: ask questions to determine whether the condition is a disability; discuss with the employee how the requested accommodation would assist him and enable him to keep working; explore alternative accommodations that may effectively meet his needs; and request medical documentation if needed.\n\nD.3. In a workplace where all employees are required to telework during this time, should an employer postpone discussing a request from an employee with a disability for an accommodation that will not be needed until he returns to the workplace when mandatory telework ends?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nNot necessarily. An employer may give higher priority to discussing requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed while teleworking, but the employer may begin discussing this request now. The employer may be able to acquire all the information it needs to make a decision. If a reasonable accommodation is granted, the employer also may be able to make some arrangements for the accommodation in advance.\n\nD.4. What if an employee was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and now requests an additional or altered accommodation?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nAn employee who was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be entitled to an additional or altered accommodation, absent undue hardship. For example, an employee who is teleworking because of the pandemic may need a different type of accommodation than what he\n\nuses in the workplace\n\n. The employer\n\nmay discuss\n\nwith the employee whether the same or a different disability is the basis for this new request and why an additional or altered accommodation is needed.\n\nD.5. During the pandemic, if an employee requests an accommodation for a medical condition either at home or in the workplace, may an employer still request information to determine if the condition is a disability?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee has a \"disability\" as defined by the ADA (a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, or a history of a substantially limiting impairment).\n\nD.6. During the pandemic, may an employer still engage in the interactive process and request information from an employee about why an accommodation is needed?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request\n\nmedical documentation\n\nto determine whether the employee's disability necessitates an accommodation, either the one he requested or any other.\n\nPossible questions\n\nfor the employee may include: (1) how the disability creates a limitation, (2) how the requested accommodation will effectively address the limitation, (3) whether another form of accommodation could effectively address the issue, and (4) how a proposed accommodation will enable the employee to continue performing the \"essential functions\" of his position (that is, the fundamental job duties).\n\nD.7. If there is some urgency to providing an accommodation, or the employer has limited time available to discuss the request during the pandemic, may an employer provide a temporary accommodation?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. Given the pandemic, some employers may choose to forgo or shorten the exchange of information between an employer and employee known as the \"interactive process\" (discussed in D.5 and D.6., above) and grant the request. In addition, when government restrictions change, or are partially or fully lifted, the need for accommodations may also change. This may result in more requests for short-term accommodations. Employers may wish to adapt the interactive process\u2014and devise end dates for the accommodation\u2014to suit changing circumstances based on public health directives.\n\nWhatever the reason for shortening or adapting the interactive process, an employer may also choose to place an end date on the accommodation (for example, either a specific date such as May 30, or when the employee returns to the workplace part- or full-time due to changes in government restrictions limiting the number of people who may congregate). Employers may also opt to provide a requested accommodation on an interim or trial basis, with an end date, while awaiting receipt of medical documentation. Choosing one of these alternatives may be particularly helpful where the requested accommodation would provide protection that an employee may need because of a pre-existing disability that puts her at greater risk during this pandemic. This\n\ncould also apply\n\nto employees who have disabilities exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nEmployees may request an extension that an employer must consider, particularly if current government restrictions are extended or new ones adopted.\n\nD.8. May an employer invite employees now to ask for reasonable accommodations they may need in the future when they are permitted to return to the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20; updated 9/8/20 to address stakeholder questions)\n\nYes. Employers may inform the workforce that employees with disabilities may request accommodations in advance that they believe they may need when the workplace re-opens. This is discussed in greater detail in Question G.6. If advance requests are received, employers may begin the \"interactive process\" \u2013 the discussion between the employer and employee focused on whether the impairment is a disability and the reasons that an accommodation is needed. If an employee chooses not to request accommodation in advance, and instead requests it at a later time, the employer must still consider the request at that time.\n\nD.9. Are the circumstances of the pandemic relevant to whether a requested accommodation can be denied because it poses an undue hardship?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. An employer does not have to provide a particular reasonable accommodation if it poses an \"\n\nundue hardship\n\n,\" which means \"significant difficulty or expense.\" As described in the two questions that follow, in some instances, an accommodation that would not have posed an undue hardship prior to the pandemic may pose one now.\n\nD.10. What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \"significant difficulty\" during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nAn employer may consider whether current circumstances create \"significant difficulty\" in acquiring or providing certain accommodations, considering the facts of the particular job and workplace. For example, it may be significantly more difficult in this pandemic to conduct a needs assessment or to acquire certain items, and delivery may be impacted, particularly for employees who may be teleworking. Or, it may be significantly more difficult to provide employees with temporary assignments, to remove marginal functions, or to readily hire temporary workers for specialized positions. If a particular accommodation poses an undue hardship, employers and employees should work together to determine if there may be an alternative that could be provided that does not pose such problems.\n\nD.11. What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \"significant expense\" during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most accommodations did not pose a significant expense when considered against an employer's overall budget and resources (always considering the budget/resources of the entire entity and not just its components). But, the sudden loss of some or all of an employer's income stream because of this pandemic is a relevant consideration. Also relevant is the amount of discretionary funds available at this time\u2014when considering other expenses\u2014and whether there is an expected date that current restrictions on an employer's operations will be lifted (or new restrictions will be added or substituted). These considerations do not mean that an employer can reject any accommodation that costs money; an employer must weigh the cost of an accommodation against its current budget while taking into account constraints created by this pandemic. For example, even under current circumstances, there may be many no-cost or very low-cost accommodations.\n\nD.12. Do the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to applicants or employees who are classified as \u201c\n\ncritical infrastructure workers\n\n\u201d or \u201c\n\nessential critical workers\n\n\u201d by the CDC?\n\n(4/23/20)\n\nYes. These CDC designations, or any other designations of certain employees, do not eliminate coverage under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, or any other equal employment opportunity law. Therefore, employers receiving requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act from employees falling in these categories of jobs must accept and process the requests as they would for any other employee. Whether the request is granted will depend on whether the worker is an individual with a disability, and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be provided absent undue hardship.\n\nD.13. Is an employee entitled to an accommodation under the ADA in order to avoid exposing a family member who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nNo. Although the ADA prohibits discrimination based on association with an individual with a disability, that protection is limited to disparate treatment or harassment. The ADA does not require that an employer accommodate an employee without a disability based on the disability-related needs of a family member or other person with whom she is associated.\n\nFor example, an employee without a disability is not entitled under the ADA to telework as an accommodation in order to protect a family member with a disability from potential COVID-19 exposure.\n\nOf course, an employer is free to provide such flexibilities if it chooses to do so. An employer choosing to offer additional flexibilities beyond what the law requires should be careful not to engage in disparate treatment on a protected EEO basis.\n\nD.14. When an employer requires some or all of its employees to telework because of COVID-19 or government officials require employers to shut down their facilities and have workers telework, is the employer required to provide a teleworking employee with the same reasonable accommodations for disability under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that it provides to this individual in the workplace?\n\n(9/8/20\n\n; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 20\n\n)\n\nIf such a request is made, the employer and employee should discuss what the employee needs and why, and whether the same or a different accommodation could suffice in the home setting. For example, an employee may already have certain things in their home to enable them to do their job so that they do not need to have all of the accommodations that are provided in the workplace.\n\nAlso, the undue hardship considerations might be different when evaluating a request for accommodation when teleworking rather than working in the workplace. A reasonable accommodation that is feasible and does not pose an undue hardship in the workplace might pose one when considering circumstances, such as the place where it is needed and the reason for telework. For example, the fact that the period of telework may be of a temporary or unknown duration may render certain accommodations either not feasible or an undue hardship. There may also be constraints on the normal availability of items or on the ability of an employer to conduct a necessary assessment.\n\nAs a practical matter, and in light of the circumstances that led to the need for telework, employers and employees should both be creative and flexible about what can be done when an employee needs a reasonable accommodation for telework at home. If possible, providing interim accommodations might be appropriate while an employer discusses a request with the employee or is waiting for additional information.\n\nD.15. Assume that an employer grants telework to employees for the purpose of slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19. When an employer reopens the workplace and recalls employees to the worksite, does the employer automatically have to grant telework as a reasonable accommodation to every employee with a disability who requests to continue this arrangement as an ADA/Rehabilitation Act accommodation?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 21)\n\nNo. Any time an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer is entitled to understand the disability-related limitation that necessitates an accommodation. If there is no disability-related limitation that requires teleworking, then the employer does not have to provide telework as an accommodation. Or, if there is a disability-related limitation but the employer can effectively address the need with another form of reasonable accommodation at the workplace, then the employer can choose that alternative to telework.\n\nTo the extent that an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID-19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions, then a request\u2014after the workplace reopens\u2014to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function. The ADA never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability.\n\nThe fact that an employer temporarily excused performance of one or more essential functions when it closed the workplace and enabled employees to telework for the purpose of protecting their safety from COVID-19, or otherwise chose to permit telework, does not mean that the employer permanently changed a job\u2019s essential functions, that telework is always a feasible accommodation, or that it does not pose an undue hardship. These are fact-specific determinations. The employer has no obligation under the ADA to refrain from restoring all of an employee\u2019s essential duties at such time as it chooses to restore the prior work arrangement, and then evaluating any requests for continued or new accommodations under the usual ADA rules.\n\nD.16. Assume that prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employee with a disability had requested telework as a reasonable accommodation. The employee had shown a disability-related need for this accommodation, but the employer denied it because of concerns that the employee would not be able to perform the essential functions remotely. In the past, the employee therefore continued to come to the workplace. However, after the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and temporary telework ends, the employee renews her request for telework as a reasonable accommodation. Can the employer again refuse the request?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 22)\n\nAssuming all the requirements for such a reasonable accommodation are satisfied, the temporary telework experience could be relevant to considering the renewed request. In this situation, for example, the period of providing telework because of the COVID-19 pandemic could serve as a trial period that showed whether or not this employee with a disability could satisfactorily perform all essential functions while working remotely, and the employer should consider any new requests in light of this information. As with all accommodation requests, the employee and the employer should engage in a flexible, cooperative interactive process going forward if this issue does arise.\n\nD.17. Might the pandemic result in excusable delays during the interactive process?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 19)\n\nYes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has disrupted normal work routines and may have resulted in unexpected or increased requests for reasonable accommodation. Although employers and employees should address these requests as soon as possible, the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delay in discussing requests and in providing accommodation where warranted. Employers and employees are encouraged to use interim solutions to enable employees to keep working as much as possible.\n\nD.18. Federal agencies are required to have timelines in their written reasonable accommodation procedures governing how quickly they will process requests and provide reasonable accommodations. What happens if circumstances created by the pandemic prevent an agency from meeting this timeline?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 19)\n\nSituations created by the current COVID-19 crisis may constitute an \u201cextenuating circumstance\u201d\u2014something beyond a Federal agency\u2019s control\u2014that may justify exceeding the normal timeline that an agency has adopted in its internal reasonable accommodation procedures.\n\nE. Pandemic-Related Harassment Due to National Origin, Race, or Other Protected Characteristics\n\nE.1. What practical tools are available to employers to reduce and address workplace harassment that may arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nEmployers can help reduce the chance of harassment by explicitly communicating to the workforce that fear of the COVID-19 pandemic should not be misdirected against individuals because of a protected characteristic, including their\n\nnational origin, race\n\n, or other prohibited bases.\n\nPractical anti-harassment tools provided by the EEOC for small businesses can be found here:\n\nAnti-harassment\n\npolicy tips\n\nfor small businesses\n\nSelect Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace (includes detailed recommendations and tools to aid in designing effective anti-harassment policies; developing training curricula; implementing complaint, reporting, and investigation procedures; creating an organizational culture in which harassment is not tolerated):\n\nreport\n\n;\n\nchecklists\n\nfor employers who want to reduce and address harassment in the workplace; and\n\nchart\n\nof risk factors that lead to harassment and appropriate responses.\n\nE.2. Are there steps an employer should take to address possible harassment and discrimination against coworkers when it re-opens the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nYes. An employer may remind all employees that it is against the federal EEO laws to harass or otherwise discriminate against coworkers based on race, national origin, color, sex, religion, age (40 or over), disability, or genetic information. It may be particularly helpful for employers to advise supervisors and managers of their roles in watching for, stopping, and reporting any harassment or other discrimination. An employer may also make clear that it will immediately review any allegations of harassment or discrimination and take appropriate action.\n\nE.3. How may employers respond to pandemic-related harassment, in particular against employees who are or are perceived to be Asian?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nManagers should be alert to demeaning, derogatory, or hostile remarks directed to employees who are or are perceived to be of Chinese or other Asian national origin, including about the coronavirus or its origins.\n\nAll employers covered by Title VII should ensure that management understands in advance how to recognize such harassment. Harassment may occur using electronic communication tools\u2014regardless of whether employees are in the workplace, teleworking, or on leave\u2014and also in person between employees at the worksite. Harassment of employees at the worksite may also originate with contractors, customers or clients, or, for example, with patients or their family members at health care facilities, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Managers should know their legal obligations and be\n\ninstructed\n\nto quickly identify and resolve potential problems, before they rise to the level of unlawful discrimination.\n\nEmployers may choose to send a reminder to the entire workforce noting Title VII\u2019s prohibitions on harassment, reminding employees that harassment will not be tolerated, and inviting anyone who experiences or witnesses workplace harassment to report it to management. Employers may remind employees that harassment can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nE.4. An employer learns that an employee who is teleworking due to the pandemic is sending harassing emails to another worker. What actions should the employer take?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThe employer should take the same actions it would take if the employee was in the workplace. Employees may not harass other employees through, for example, emails, calls, or platforms for video or chat communication and collaboration.\n\nF. Furloughs and Layoffs\n\nF.1. Under the EEOC's laws, what waiver responsibilities apply when an employer is conducting layoffs?\n\n(4/9/20)\n\nSpecial rules apply when an employer is offering employees severance packages in exchange for a general release of all discrimination claims against the employer. More information is available in EEOC's\n\ntechnical assistance document on severance agreements\n\n.\n\nF.2. What are additional EEO considerations in planning furloughs or layoffs?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 13)\n\nThe laws enforced by the EEOC prohibit covered employers from selecting people for furlough or layoff because of that individual\u2019s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, protected genetic information, or in retaliation for protected EEO activity.\n\nG. Return to Work\n\nG.1. As government stay-at-home orders and other restrictions are modified or lifted in your area, how will employers know what steps they can take consistent with the ADA to screen employees for COVID-19 when entering the workplace?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nThe ADA permits employers to make disability-related inquiries and conduct medical exams if job-related and consistent with business necessity. Inquiries and reliable medical exams meet this standard if it is necessary to exclude employees with a medical condition that would pose a direct threat to health or safety.\n\nDirect threat is to be determined based on the best available objective medical evidence. The guidance from CDC or other public health authorities is such evidence. Therefore, employers will be acting consistent with the ADA as long as any screening implemented is consistent with advice from the CDC and public health authorities for that type of workplace at that time.\n\nFor example, this may include continuing to take temperatures and asking questions about symptoms (or require self-reporting)\n\nof all those entering the workplace\n\n. Similarly, the CDC recently posted\n\ninformation\n\non return by certain types of critical workers.\n\nEmployers should make sure not to engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in decisions related to screening and exclusion.\n\nG.2. An employer requires returning workers to wear personal protective gear and engage in infection control practices. Some employees ask for accommodations due to a need for modified protective gear. Must an employer grant these requests?\n\n(4/17/20)\n\nAn employer may require employees to wear\n\nprotective gear\n\n(for example, masks and gloves) and observe\n\ninfection control practices\n\n(for example, regular hand washing and social distancing protocols).\n\nHowever, where an employee with a disability needs a related reasonable accommodation under the ADA (e.g., non-latex gloves, modified face masks for interpreters or others who communicate with an employee who uses lip reading, or gowns designed for individuals who use wheelchairs), or a religious accommodation under Title VII (such as modified equipment due to religious garb), the employer should discuss the request and provide the modification or an alternative if feasible and not an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business under the ADA or Title VII.\n\nG.3. What does an employee need to do in order to request reasonable accommodation from her employer because she has one of the\n\nmedical conditions\n\nthat CDC says may put her at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\n\n(5/5/20)\n\nAn employee\u2014or a third party, such as an employee\u2019s doctor\u2014must\n\nlet the employer know\n\nthat she needs a change for a reason related to a medical condition (here, the underlying condition). Individuals may request accommodation in conversation or in writing. While the employee (or third party) does not need to use the term \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d or reference the ADA, she may do so.\n\nThe employee or her representative should communicate that she has a medical condition that necessitates a change to meet a medical need. After receiving a request, the employer may\n\nask questions or seek medical documentation\n\nto help decide if the individual has a disability and if there is a reasonable accommodation, barring\n\nundue hardship\n\n, that can be provided.\n\nG.4. The CDC identifies a number of medical conditions that might place individuals at\n\n\u201chigher risk for severe illness\u201d\n\nif they get COVID-19. An employer knows that an employee has one of these conditions and is concerned that his health will be jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, but the employee has not requested accommodation. How does the ADA apply to this situation?\n\n(5/7/20)\n\nFirst, if the employee does not request a reasonable accommodation, the ADA does not mandate that the employer take action.\n\nIf the employer is concerned about the employee\u2019s health being jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, the ADA does not allow the employer to exclude the employee\u2014or take any other adverse action\u2014\n\nsolely\n\nbecause the employee has a disability that the CDC identifies as potentially placing him at \u201chigher risk for severe illness\u201d if he gets COVID-19. Under the ADA, such action is not allowed unless the employee\u2019s disability poses a \u201cdirect threat\u201d to his health that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\n\nThe ADA direct threat requirement is a high standard. As an affirmative defense, direct threat requires an employer to show that the individual has a disability that poses a \u201csignificant risk of substantial harm\u201d to his own health under\n\n29 C.F.R. section 1630.2(r)\n\n(regulation addressing direct threat to health or safety of self or others). A direct threat assessment cannot be based solely on the condition being on the CDC\u2019s list; the determination must be an individualized assessment based on a reasonable medical judgment about this employee\u2019s disability\u2014not the disability in general\u2014using the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. The ADA regulation requires an employer to consider the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. Analysis of these factors will likely include considerations based on the severity of the pandemic in a particular area and the employee\u2019s own health (for example, is the employee\u2019s disability well-controlled), and his particular job duties. A determination of direct threat also would include the likelihood that an individual will be exposed to the virus at the worksite. Measures that an employer may be taking in general to protect all workers, such as mandatory social distancing, also would be relevant.\n\nEven if an employer determines that an employee\u2019s disability poses a direct threat to his own health, the employer still cannot exclude the employee from the workplace\u2014or take any other adverse action\u2014unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship). The ADA regulations require an employer to consider whether there are reasonable accommodations that would eliminate or reduce the risk so that it would be safe for the employee to return to the workplace while still permitting performance of essential functions. This can involve an interactive process with the employee. If there are not accommodations that permit this, then an employer must consider accommodations such as telework, leave, or reassignment (perhaps to a different job in a place where it may be safer for the employee to work or that permits telework). An employer may only bar an employee from the workplace if, after going through all these steps, the facts support the conclusion that the employee poses a significant risk of substantial harm to himself that cannot be reduced or eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\n\nG.5. What are examples of accommodation that, absent undue hardship, may eliminate (or reduce to an acceptable level) a direct threat to self?\n\n(5/5/20)\n\nAccommodations\n\nmay include additional or enhanced protective gowns, masks, gloves, or other gear beyond what the employer may generally provide to employees returning to its workplace. Accommodations also may include additional or enhanced protective measures, for example, erecting a barrier that provides separation between an employee with a disability and coworkers/the public or increasing the space between an employee with a disability and others. Another possible reasonable accommodation may be elimination or substitution of particular \u201cmarginal\u201d functions (less critical or incidental job duties as distinguished from the \u201cessential\u201d functions of a particular position). In addition, accommodations may include temporary modification of work schedules (if that decreases contact with coworkers and/or the public when on duty or commuting) or moving the location of where one performs work (for example, moving a person to the end of a production line rather than in the middle of it if that provides more social distancing).\n\nThese are only a few ideas. Identifying an effective accommodation depends, among other things, on an employee\u2019s job duties and the design of the workspace. An employer and employee should discuss possible ideas; the Job Accommodation Network (\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n) also may be able to assist in helping identify possible accommodations. As with all discussions of reasonable accommodation during this pandemic, employers and employees are encouraged to be creative and flexible.\n\nG.6. As a best practice, and in advance of having some or all employees return to the workplace, are there ways for an employer to invite employees to request flexibility in work arrangements?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nYes. The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act permit employers to make information available in advance to\n\nall\n\nemployees about who to contact\u2014if they wish\u2014to request accommodation for a disability that they may need upon return to the workplace, even if no date has been announced for their return. If requests are received in advance, the employer may begin the\n\ninteractive process\n\n. An employer may choose to include in such a notice all the CDC-listed medical conditions that may place people at higher risk of serious illness if they contract COVID-19, provide instructions about who to contact, and explain that the employer is willing to consider on a case-by-case basis any requests from employees who have these or other medical conditions.\n\nAn employer also may send a general notice to all employees who are designated for returning to the workplace, noting that the employer is willing to consider requests for accommodation or flexibilities on an individualized basis. The employer should specify if the contacts differ depending on the reason for the request \u2013 for example, if the office or person to contact is different for employees with disabilities or pregnant workers than for employees whose request is based on age or child-care responsibilities.\n\nEither approach is consistent with the ADEA, the ADA, and the May 29, 2020\n\nCDC guidance\n\nthat emphasizes the importance of employers providing accommodations or flexibilities to employees who, due to age or certain medical conditions, are at higher risk for severe illness.\n\nRegardless of the approach, however, employers should ensure that whoever receives inquiries knows how to handle them consistent with the different federal employment nondiscrimination laws that may apply, for instance, with respect to accommodations due to a medical condition, a religious belief, or pregnancy.\n\nG.7. What should an employer do if an employee entering the worksite requests an alternative method of screening due to a medical condition?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThis is a request for reasonable accommodation, and an employer should proceed as it would for any other request for accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. If the requested change is easy to provide and inexpensive, the employer might voluntarily choose to make it available to anyone who asks, without going through an interactive process. Alternatively, if the disability is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask the employee for information to establish that the condition is a\n\ndisability\n\nand what specific limitations require an accommodation. If necessary, an employer also may request medical documentation to support the employee\u2019s request, and then determine if that accommodation or an alternative effective accommodation can be provided, absent undue hardship.\n\nSimilarly, if an employee requested an alternative method of screening as a religious accommodation, the employer should determine if accommodation is\n\navailable under Title VII\n\n.\n\nH. Age\n\nH.1. The\n\nCDC has explained\n\nthat individuals age 65 and over are at higher risk for a severe case of COVID-19 if they contract the virus and therefore has encouraged employers to offer maximum flexibilities to this group. Do employees age 65 and over have protections under the federal employment discrimination laws?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals age 40 and older. The ADEA would prohibit a covered employer from involuntarily excluding an individual from the workplace based on his or her being 65 or older, even if the employer acted for benevolent reasons such as protecting the employee due to higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nUnlike the ADA, the ADEA does not include a right to reasonable accommodation for older workers due to age. However, employers are free to provide flexibility to workers age 65 and older; the ADEA does not prohibit this, even if it results in younger workers ages 40-64 being treated less favorably based on age in comparison.\n\nWorkers age 65 and older also may have medical conditions that bring them under the protection of the ADA as individuals with disabilities. As such, they may request reasonable\n\naccommodation for their disability\n\nas opposed to their age.\n\nH.2. If an employer is choosing to offer flexibilities to other workers, may older comparable workers be treated less favorably based on age?\n\n(9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 12)\n\nNo. If an employer is allowing other comparable workers to telework, it should make sure it is not treating older workers less favorably based on their age.\n\nI. Caregivers/Family Responsibilities\n\nI.1. If an employer provides telework, modified schedules, or other benefits to employees with school-age children due to school closures or distance learning during the pandemic, are there sex discrimination considerations?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nEmployers may provide any flexibilities as long as they are not treating employees differently based on sex or other EEO-protected characteristics. For example, under Title VII, female employees cannot be given more favorable treatment than male employees because of a gender-based assumption about who may have\n\ncaretaking responsibilities\n\nfor children.\n\nJ. Pregnancy\n\nJ.1. Due to the pandemic, may an employer exclude an employee from the workplace involuntarily\n\ndue to pregnancy\n\n?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nNo. Sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act includes discrimination based on pregnancy. Even if motivated by benevolent concern, an employer is not permitted to single out workers on the basis of pregnancy for adverse employment actions, including involuntary leave, layoff, or furlough.\n\nJ.2.\n\nIs there a right to accommodation based on pregnancy during the pandemic?\n\n(6/11/20)\n\nThere are two federal employment discrimination laws that may trigger\n\naccommodation for employees based on pregnancy\n\n.\n\nFirst, pregnancy-related medical conditions may themselves be disabilities under the ADA, even though pregnancy itself is not an ADA disability. If an employee makes a request for reasonable accommodation due to a pregnancy-related medical condition, the employer must consider it under the usual ADA rules.\n\nSecond, Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifically requires that women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions be treated the same as others who are similar in their ability or inability to work. This means that a pregnant employee may be entitled to job modifications, including telework, changes to work schedules or assignments, and leave to the extent provided for other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work. Employers should ensure that supervisors, managers, and human resources personnel know how to handle such requests to avoid disparate treatment in violation of Title VII.\n\nK. Vaccinations\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccinations may raise questions about the applicablilty of various equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws, including the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, GINA, and Title VII, including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (see\n\nSection J, EEO rights relating to pregnancy\n\n).\u00a0 The EEO laws do not interfere with or prevent employers from following CDC or other federal, state, and local public health authorities\u2019 guidelines and suggestions.\n\nADA and Vaccinations\n\nK.1. For any COVID-19 vaccine that has been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine to an employee by an employer (or by a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine) a \u201cmedical examination\u201d for purposes of the ADA?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo. \u00a0The vaccination itself is not a medical examination.\u00a0 As the Commission explained in\n\nguidance on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations\n\n, a medical examination is \u201ca procedure or test usually given by a health care professional or in a medical setting that seeks information about an individual\u2019s physical or mental impairments or health.\u201d\u00a0 Examples include \u201cvision tests; blood, urine, and breath analyses; blood pressure screening and cholesterol testing; and diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs.\u201d \u00a0If a vaccine is administered to an employee by an employer for protection against contracting COVID-19, the employer is not seeking information about an individual\u2019s impairments or current health status and, therefore, it is not a medical examination.\n\nAlthough the administration of a vaccination is not a medical examination, pre-screening vaccination questions may implicate the ADA\u2019s provision on disability-related inquiries, which are inquiries likely to elicit information about a disability.\u00a0 If the employer administers the vaccine, it must show that such pre-screening questions it asks employees are \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d\n\nSee Question K.2\n\n.\n\nK.2. According to the CDC, health care providers should ask certain questions before administering a vaccine to ensure that there is no medical reason that would prevent the person from receiving the vaccination. If the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination from the employer (or a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine) and asks these screening questions, are these questions subject to the ADA standards for disability-related inquiries?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nYes.\u00a0 Pre-vaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about a disability.\u00a0 This means that such questions, if asked by the employer or a contractor on the employer\u2019s behalf, are \u201cdisability-related\u201d under the ADA.\u00a0 Thus, if the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination, administered by the employer, the employer must show that these disability-related screening inquiries are \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d \u00a0To meet this standard, an employer would need to have a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that an employee who does not answer the questions and, therefore, does not receive a vaccination, will pose a direct threat to the health or safety of her or himself or others.\n\nSee Question K.5.\n\nbelow for a discussion of direct threat.\n\nBy contrast, there are two circumstances in which disability-related screening questions can be asked without needing to satisfy the \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d requirement.\u00a0 First, if an employer has offered a vaccination to employees on a voluntary basis (i.e. employees choose whether to be vaccinated), the ADA requires that the employee\u2019s decision to answer pre-screening, disability-related questions also must be voluntary.\n\n42 U.S.C. 12112(d)(4)(B)\n\n;\n\n29 C.F.R. 1630.14(d)\n\n. \u00a0If an employee chooses not to answer these questions, the employer may decline to administer the vaccine but may not retaliate against, intimidate, or threaten the employee for refusing to answer any questions. \u00a0Second, if an employee receives an employer-required vaccination from a third party that does not have a contract with the employer, such as a pharmacy or other health care provider, the ADA \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity\u201d restrictions on disability-related inquiries would not apply to the pre-vaccination medical screening questions.\n\nThe ADA requires employers to keep any employee medical information obtained in the course of the vaccination program\n\nconfidential\n\n.\n\nK.3. Is asking or requiring an employee to show proof of receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination a disability-related inquiry?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo.\u00a0 There are many reasons that may explain why an employee has not been vaccinated, which may or may not be disability-related.\u00a0 Simply requesting proof of receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination is not likely to elicit information about a disability and, therefore, is not a disability-related inquiry.\u00a0 However, subsequent employer questions, such as asking why an individual did not receive a vaccination, may elicit information about a disability and would be subject to the pertinent ADA standard that they be \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d\u00a0 If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination from a pharmacy or their own health care provider, the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide any medical information as part of the proof in order to avoid implicating the ADA.\n\nADA and Title VII Issues Regarding Mandatory Vaccinations\n\nK.4. Where can employers learn more about Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) of COVID-19 vaccines?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nSome COVID-19 vaccines may only be available to the public for the foreseeable future under EUA granted by the FDA, which is different than approval under FDA vaccine licensure. The\n\nFDA has an obligation\n\nto:\n\n[E]nsure that recipients of the vaccine under an EUA are informed, to the extent practicable under the applicable circumstances, that FDA has authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, of the known and potential benefits and risks, the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown, that they have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine, and of any available alternatives to the product.\n\nThe FDA says that this information is typically conveyed in a patient fact sheet that is provided at the time of the vaccine administration and that it posts the fact sheets on its website.\u00a0 More information about EUA vaccines is available on the\n\nFDA\u2019s EUA page\n\n.\n\nK.5. If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available, how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccination because of a disability?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nThe ADA allows an employer to have a\n\nqualification standard\n\nthat includes \u201ca requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace.\u201d \u00a0However, if a safety-based qualification standard, such as a vaccination requirement, screens out or tends to screen out an individual with a disability, the employer must show that an unvaccinated employee would pose a direct threat due to a \u201csignificant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\u201d\n\n29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r)\n\n.\u00a0 Employers should conduct an individualized assessment of four factors in determining whether a direct threat exists: the duration of the risk; the nature and severity of the potential harm; the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and the imminence of the potential harm.\u00a0 A conclusion that there is a direct threat would include a determination that an unvaccinated individual will expose others to the virus at the worksite. \u00a0If an employer determines that an individual who cannot be vaccinated due to disability poses a direct threat at the worksite, the employer cannot exclude the employee from the workplace\u2014or take any other action\u2014unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent\n\nundue hardship\n\n) that would eliminate or reduce this risk so the unvaccinated employee does not pose a direct threat.\n\nIf there is a direct threat that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level,\n\nthe employer can exclude\n\nthe employee from physically entering the workplace, but this does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker.\u00a0 Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state, and local authorities. \u00a0For example, if an employer excludes an employee based on an inability to accommodate a request to be exempt from a vaccination requirement, the employee may be entitled to accommodations such as performing the current position remotely. This is the same step that employers take when physically excluding employees from a worksite due to a current COVID-19 diagnosis or symptoms; some workers may be entitled to telework or, if not, may be eligible to take leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, under the FMLA, or under the employer\u2019s policies.\n\nSee also\n\nSection J, EEO rights relating to pregnancy\n\n.\n\nManagers and supervisors responsible for communicating with employees about compliance with the employer\u2019s vaccination requirement should know how to recognize an accommodation request from an employee with a disability and know to whom the request should be referred for consideration. \u00a0Employers and employees should engage in a flexible, interactive process to identify workplace accommodation options that do not constitute an undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense). \u00a0This process should include determining whether it is necessary to obtain supporting documentation about the employee\u2019s disability and considering the possible options for accommodation given the nature of the workforce and the employee\u2019s position.\u00a0 The prevalence in the workplace of employees who already have received a COVID-19 vaccination and the amount of contact with others, whose vaccination status could be unknown, may impact the undue hardship consideration.\u00a0 In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees also may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website as a resource for different types of accommodations,\n\nwww.askjan.org\n\n. \u00a0JAN\u2019s materials specific to COVID-19 are at\n\nhttps://askjan.org/topics/COVID-19.cfm\n\n.\n\nEmployers may rely on CDC recommendations when deciding whether an effective accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship is available, but as explained further in\n\nQuestion K.7.\n\n, there may be situations where an accommodation is not possible.\u00a0 When an employer makes this decision, the facts about particular job duties and workplaces may be relevant.\u00a0 Employers also should consult applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and guidance.\u00a0 Employers can find OSHA COVID-specific resources at:\n\nwww.osha.gov/SLTC/covid-19/\n\n.\n\nManagers and supervisors are reminded that it is unlawful to disclose that an employee is receiving a reasonable accommodation or retaliate against an employee for\n\nrequesting an accommodation\n\n.\n\nK.6. If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available, how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID-19 vaccination because of a sincerely held religious practice or belief?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nOnce an employer is on notice that an employee\u2019s sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance prevents the employee from receiving the vaccination, the employer must provide a reasonable accommodation for the religious belief, practice, or observance unless it would pose an undue hardship under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\u00a0 Courts have defined \u201cundue hardship\u201d under\n\nTitle VII\n\nas having more than a\n\nde minimis\n\ncost or burden on the employer. EEOC guidance explains that because the definition of religion is broad and protects beliefs, practices, and observances with which the employer may be unfamiliar, the employer should ordinarily assume that an employee\u2019s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief. \u00a0If, however, an employee requests a religious accommodation, and an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief, practice, or observance, the employer would be justified in requesting additional supporting information.\n\nK.7. What happens if an employer cannot exempt or provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee who cannot comply with a mandatory vaccine policy because of a disability or sincerely held religious practice or belief?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nIf an employee cannot get vaccinated for COVID-19 because of a disability or sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, and there is no reasonable accommodation possible, then it would be lawful for the employer to\n\nexclude\n\nthe employee from the workplace. \u00a0This does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker.\u00a0 Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal, state, and local authorities.\n\nTitle II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and Vaccinations\n\nK.8. Is Title II of GINA implicated when an employer administers a COVID-19 vaccine to employees or requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nNo. Administering a COVID-19 vaccination to employees or requiring employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination does not implicate Title II of GINA because it does not involve the use of genetic information to make employment decisions, or the acquisition or disclosure of \u201cgenetic information\u201d as defined by the statute. This includes vaccinations that use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which will be discussed more below.\u00a0 As noted in Question K.9. however, if administration of the vaccine requires pre-screening questions that ask about genetic information, the inquiries seeking genetic information, such as family members\u2019 medical histories, may violate GINA.\n\nUnder Title II of GINA, employers may not (1) use genetic information to make decisions related to the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, (2) acquire genetic information except in six narrow circumstances, or (3) disclose genetic information except in six narrow circumstances.\n\nCertain COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology. This raises questions about genetics and, specifically, about whether such vaccines modify a recipient\u2019s genetic makeup and, therefore, whether requiring an employee to get the vaccine as a condition of employment is an unlawful use of genetic information. \u00a0The CDC has explained that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines \u201cdo not interact with our DNA in any way\u201d and \u201cmRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA (genetic material) is kept.\u201d (See\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html\n\nfor a detailed discussion about how mRNA vaccines work).\u00a0 Thus, requiring employees to get the vaccine, whether it uses mRNA technology or not, does not violate GINA\u2019s prohibitions on using, acquiring, or disclosing genetic information.\n\nK.9. Does asking an employee the pre-vaccination screening questions before administering a COVID-19 vaccine implicate Title II of GINA?\n\n(12/16/20)\n\nPre-vaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about disability, as discussed in\n\nQuestion K.2.\n\n, and may elicit information about genetic information, such as questions regarding the immune systems of family members.\u00a0 It is not yet clear what screening checklists for contraindications will be provided with COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nGINA defines \u201cgenetic information\u201d to mean:\n\nInformation about an individual\u2019s genetic tests;\n\nInformation about the genetic tests of a family member;\n\nInformation about the manifestation of disease or disorder in a family member (i.e., family medical history);\n\nInformation about requests for, or receipt of, genetic services or the participation in clinical research that includes genetic services by the an individual or a family member of the individual; and\n\nGenetic information about a fetus carried by an individual or family member or of an embryo legally held by an individual or family member using assisted reproductive technology.\n\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1635.3(c).\u00a0 If the pre-vaccination questions do\n\nnot\n\ninclude any questions about genetic information (including family medical history), then asking them does not implicate GINA.\u00a0 However, if the pre-vaccination questions\n\ndo\n\ninclude questions about genetic information, then employers who want to ensure that employees have been vaccinated may want to request proof of vaccination instead of administering the vaccine themselves.\n\nGINA does not prohibit an individual employee\u2019s own health care provider from asking questions about genetic information, but it does prohibit an employer or a doctor working for the employer from asking questions about genetic information.\u00a0 If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID-19 vaccination from their own health care provider, the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide genetic information as part of the proof.\u00a0 As long as this warning is provided, any genetic information the employer receives in response to its request for proof of vaccination will be considered inadvertent and therefore not unlawful under GINA.\n\nSee\n\n29 CFR 1635.8(b)(1)(i) for model language that can be used for this warning.\n\nReturn to top\n\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\nEEOC Headquarters\n\n131 M Street, NE\n\nWashington, DC 20507\n\n202-663-4900 / (TTY) 202-663-4494\n\nQuestions?\n\nCall 1-800-669-4000\n\nFor Deaf/Hard of Hearing callers:\n\n1-800-669-6820 (TTY)\n\n1-844-234-5122 (ASL Video Phone)\n\ninfo@eeoc.gov\n\nFind your nearest EEOC office\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nSign up for email or text updates\n\nConnect With Us\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nRSS\n\nFOIA\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAccessibility\n\nOffice of Inspector General\n\nUSA.gov\n",
