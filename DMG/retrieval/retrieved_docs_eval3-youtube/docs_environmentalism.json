As\n\nBoer\n\nfarms were destroyed by the British under their \"\n\nScorched Earth\n\n\" policy, many tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly moved into the concentration camps. Over 26,000 Boer women and children were to perish in these concentration camps.\n\n[2]\n\n1899\u20131902 Philippine\u2013American War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nSee also:\n\nUnited States Senate Committee on the Philippines \u00a7\u00a0Investigation\n\n, and\n\nAmerican war crimes\n\nIn November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the\n\nPhiladelphia Ledger\n\nwrote: \"The present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog...\"\n\n[3]\n\nIn response to the\n\nBalangiga massacre\n\n, which wiped out a U.S. company garrisoning\n\nSamar\n\ntown, U.S. Brigadier General\n\nJacob H.

Before, the\n\nSecond Boer War\n\ntook place after the\n\nHague Convention of 1899\n\n. The Second Boer War (1899 until 1902) is known for the first concentration camps (1900 until 1902) for civilians in the 20th century.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|

The massacre was reported to a newspaper by American citizens who were also on board the Nicosian .[21]   Another attack occurred on 24 September a month later when Baralong  destroyed U-41 , which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship Urbino .

The lands were to be expropriated, and the owners deported to Siberia. The land was to be given to Russian war veterans once the war was over. In July 1915, without prior warning, 150,000 German settlers from Volhynia were arrested and shipped to internal exile in Siberia and Central Asia. (Some sources indicate that the number of deportees reached 200,000). Ukrainian peasants took over their lands.

Contributing factors included\n\nNazi\n\nrace theory, a desire for \"living space\" that justified the eradication of native populations, and militaristic indoctrination that encouraged the terrorization of conquered peoples and\n\nprisoners of war\n\n. The\n\nHolocaust\n\n, the German attack on the Soviet Union and occupation of much of Europe, the Japanese occupation of\n\nManchuria\n\nand the Philippines and attack on China all contributed to well over half of the civilian deaths in World War II and the conflicts that led up to the war. Even before post-war revelations of atrocities, Axis militaries were notorious for their brutal treatment of captured combatants.\n\nCrimes perpetrated by Germany\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nFurther information:\n\nNazi Germany\n\n,\n\nGerman war crimes \u00a7\u00a0World War II\n\n, and\n\nConsequences of Nazism\n\nAccording to the\n\nNuremberg Trials\n\n, there were four major war crimes that were alleged against German military (and Waffen-SS and NSDAP) men and officers, each with individual events that made up the major charges.\n\n1. Participation in a common plan of\n\nconspiracy\n\nfor the accomplishment of\n\ncrimes against peace\n\n2. Planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace\n\nPlanning and executing a campaign of invasion of its European neighbors, as well as the conspiracy to violate the\n\nTreaty of Versailles\n\nand the\n\nTreaty of Saint-Germain\n\nthrough the\n\nremilitarization of the Rhineland\n\n, and the annexations of\n\nAustria\n\nand\n\nCzechoslovakia\n\n.\n\n3. War Crimes\n\nAtrocities against enemy combatants or conventional crimes committed by military units (see\n\nWar crimes of the Wehrmacht\n\n), and include:\n\nInvasion of Poland\n\n: During the period of 1 September \u2013 25 October 1939 German forces in their military actions engaged in executions of Polish POWs, bombing hospitals, murdering civilians, shooting refugees, and executing wounded soldiers. The cautious estimates give a number of at least 16,000 murdered victims.\n\n[43]\n\nPacification Operations in German occupied Poland\n\n: During the occupation of Poland by German Reich, Wehrmacht forces took part in several pacification actions in rural areas, that resulted in murder of at least 20,000 Polish villagers.\n\nLe Paradis massacre\n\n: In May 1940, British soldiers of the\n\nRoyal Norfolk Regiment\n\nwere captured by the SS and subsequently murdered.\n\nFritz Knoechlein\n\nwas tried found guilty and hanged.\n\nWormhoudt massacre\n\n: In May 1940, British and French soldiers were captured by the SS and subsequently murdered. No one found guilty of the crime.\n\nd'Ardenne Massacres\n\n: In June 1944 Canadian soldiers were captured by the SS and murdered by the\n\n12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend\n\n. SS General\n\nKurt Meyer (Panzermeyer)\n\nwas sentenced to be shot 1946. His sentence was commuted and he was released in 1954.\n\nMalmedy massacre\n\n: In December 1944, United States POWs captured by\n\nKampfgruppe Peiper\n\nwere murdered outside\n\nMalmedy\n\n, Belgium.\n\nAnnouncement of execution of 150 Polish hostages as revenge for assassination of 6 Germans, Warsaw,\n\nNazi-occupied Poland\n\n, May 1944\n\nGardelegen (war crime)\n\n: The German SS forced 1,016 slave laborers who were part of transports evacuated from several sub-camps of\n\nMittelbau-Dora\n\nConcentration Camp and from the sub-camp Hannover-St\u00f6cken of\n\nNeuengamme\n\nConcentration Camp into a large barn which was then lit on fire. Most of the prisoners were burned alive; some were shot trying to escape.\n\nMarzabotto massacre\n\n: The German SS killing of at least 770 civilians of Marzabotto as a collective punishment for their support of Italian partisans and the\n\nItalian resistance movement\n\nSant'Anna di Stazzema massacre\n\n: A massacre was committed in the hill village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema in Tuscany, Italy, in the course of an operation against the Italian resistance movement during the Italian Campaign of World War II.  560 local villagers and refugees were murdered and their bodies burnt in a scorched earth policy action by the Nazis.\n\nCefalonia Massacre\n\n: The mass execution of the men of the Italian 33rd Acqui Infantry Division by the Germans on the island of Cephalonia, Greece was committed after the\n\nItalian armistice\n\n.\n\nOradour-sur-Glane massacre\n\n: On 10 June 1944, the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in Haute-Vienne in then Nazi occupied France was destroyed.  642 of its inhabitants, including women and children, were massacred by a Waffen-SS company.\n\nThe annihilation of the Czech city of\n\nLidice\n\nwas committed as an act of vengeance for the assassination of\n\nReinhard Heydrich\n\n.\n\nMassacre of Kalavryta\n\n: The extermination of the male population and the total destruction of the town of Kalavryta, in Greece, by German occupying forces during World War II, was committed on 13 December 1943.\n\nDistomo massacre\n\n: This attack was perpetrated by members of the Waffen-SS in the village of Distomo, Greece, during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II.\n\nKragujevac massacre\n\n:  This was a\n\nnazi war crime\n\nin which\n\nSerbs\n\n,\n\nJews\n\nand\n\nRoma\n\nmen and boys in\n\nKragujevac\n\n,\n\nSerbia\n\n, were murdered by\n\nGerman\n\nWehrmacht\n\nsoldiers on 20 and 21 October 1941.\n\nThe suppression of the 1944\n\nWarsaw Uprising\n\nand\n\nsubsequent leveling of the whole city\n\nwas a war crime.\n\nNaked\n\nSoviet prisoners of war\n\nin Mauthausen concentration camp. Unknown date\n\nThe treatment of Soviet POWs throughout the war, who were not given the protections and guarantees of the\n\nGeneva Convention\n\nunlike other Allied prisoners was a war crime.\n\nNazi crimes against Soviet POWs\n\n, resulted in some 3.3 million to 3.5 million deaths.  This accounts for about 60% of all Soviet\n\nPOWs.\n\n[44]\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare\n\nagainst merchant shipping was another war crime.\n\nCommando Order\n\nwhich stated that Allied combatants encountered during\n\ncommando\n\noperations were to be executed immediately upon capture and without trial, even if they were properly uniformed, unarmed, or intending to surrender was a war crime.\n\nCommissar Order\n\n:  An order stating that\n\nSoviet\n\npolitical commissars found among captured troops were to be executed immediately was a war crime.\n\nVinkt Massacre\n\n: In May 1940 at least 86 civilians in Vinkt were killed by the German\n\nWehrmacht\n\n.\n\nHeusden\n\n: A town hall was massacred in November 1944.\n\nGerman war crimes during the Battle of Moscow\n\nare another example.\n\n4. Crimes against Humanity\n\nCrimes committed well away from the lines of battle and unconnected in any way to military activity, distinct from war crimes\n\nThe major crime was the\n\nHolocaust\n\n, including:\n\nThe construction and use of\n\nVernichtungslagern\n\n(extermination camps) to commit genocide, most prominently at\n\nAuschwitz\n\n,\n\nTreblinka\n\n,\n\nMajdanek\n\n,\n\nBe\u0142\u017cec\n\n,\n\nSobib\u00f3r\n\n, and\n\nChe\u0142mno\n\nThe employment of other concentration camps across Europe, including\n\nDachau\n\n,\n\nSachsenhausen\n\n,\n\nMauthausen\n\nand\n\nBergen-Belsen\n\n, which held Soviet POWs and political prisoners in inhuman conditions, and transported Jews and Roma to extermination camps\n\nDeath marches\n\nof prisoners, particularly in the last months of the war when the aforementioned camps were being overrun by the\n\nAllies\n\nThe widespread use of\n\nslave labor\n\nand forced/unfree labor by the Nazi regime, including the use of\n\nconcentration camp\n\nand\n\nextermination camp\n\nprisoners as slaves, often with the intent of\n\nextermination through labor\n\nGerman police shooting women and children from the\n\nMizocz Ghetto\n\n, 14 October 1942\n\nThe establishment of Jewish\n\nGhettos\n\nin Eastern Europe intended to isolate Jewish communities for deportation and subsequent extermination\n\nThe use of\n\nSS\n\nEinsatzgruppen\n\n, mobile extermination squads, to exterminate Jews and anti-nazi \"partisans\"\n\nBabi Yar\n\na series of massacres in Kiev, the most notorious and the best documented of these massacres took place on 29\u201330 September 1941, wherein 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation. The decision to kill all the Jews in Kiev was made by the military governor, Major-General Kurt Eberhard, the Police Commander for Army Group South, SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Friedrich Jeckeln, and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by Sonderkommando 4a soldiers, along with the aid of the SD and SS Police Battalions backed by the local police.\n\nRumbula\n\na collective term for incidents on two non-consecutive days (November 30 and December 8, 1941) in which about 25,000 Jews were killed in or on the way to Rumbula forest near Riga, Latvia, during the Holocaust\n\nNinth Fort\n\nBy the order of SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer Karl J\u00e4ger and SS-Rottenf\u00fchrer\n\nHelmut Rauca\n\n, the Sonderkommando under the leadership of SS-Obersturmf\u00fchrer Joachim Hamann, and 8 to 10 men from Einsatzkommando 3, in collaboration with Lithuanian partisans, murdered 2,007 Jewish men, 2,920 women, and 4,273 children in a single day at the Ninth Fort, Kaunas, Lithuania.\n\nSimferopol\n\nGermans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol, killing in total over 22,000 locals\u2014mostly\n\nJews\n\n,\n\nRussians\n\n,\n\nKrymchaks\n\n, and\n\nGypsies\n\n.\n\n[45]\n\nOn one occasion, starting December 9, 1941, the\n\nEinsatzgruppen D\n\nunder\n\nOtto Ohlendorf\n\n's command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents, most of them being Jews.\n\n[46]\n\nThe massacre of 100,000 Jews and Poles at\n\nPaneriai\n\nThe suppression of the 1943\n\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising\n\nwhich erupted when the SS came to clear the Jewish ghetto and send all of the occupants to extermination camps\n\nAleksandras Lileikis\n\n, a Nazi\n\nSaugumas\n\nunit commander who oversaw the murder of 60,000 Jews in\n\nLithuania\n\n. He later worked for the\n\nCIA\n\n.\n\n[47]\n\nIzieu Massacre\n\nIzieu was the site of a Jewish orphanage during the Second World War. On 6 April 1944, three vehicles pulled up in front of the orphanage. The Gestapo, under the direction of the 'Butcher of Lyon'\n\nKlaus Barbie\n\n, entered the orphanage and forcibly removed the forty-four children and their seven supervisors, throwing the crying and terrified children on to the trucks. Following the raid on their home in Izieu, the children were shipped directly to the \"collection center\" in Drancy, then put on the first available train towards the concentration camps in the East.\n\nOther crimes against humanity included:\n\nThe\n\nPorajmos\n\n, the mass killings of the\n\nRomany\n\npeoples of Europe by the Nazis\n\nThe\n\n\u0141apanka\n\nor \"Catching Game\", \u2013 Nazi roundups of Poles in the major cities for slave labor\n\nNikolaev Massacre\n\n, which resulted in the deaths of 35,782 Soviet citizens, most of whom were Jews.\n\nOperation Tannenberg\n\n, the\n\nAB Action\n\nand the\n\nMassacre of Lw\u00f3w professors\n\n, all Nazi actions in Poland meant to mass murder the Polish intelligentsia and other potential leaders of resistance.\n\n[48]\n\n[49]\n\nThe Nazi\n\nT-4 Euthanasia Program\n\n, an aborted eugenics program meant to kill German children who were mentally or physically handicapped. 200,000 people were murdered due to this program.\n\nAt least 10 million, and perhaps over 20 million perished directly and indirectly due to the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes by the Nazi regime, of which the Holocaust lives on in particular infamy, for its particularly cruel nature and scope, and the industrialised nature of the genocide of Jewish citizens of states invaded or controlled by the Nazi regime. At least 5.9 million\n\nJews\n\nwere murdered by the Nazis, or 66 to 78% of Europe's Jewish population, although a complete count may never be known. Though much of Continental Europe suffered under the Nazi occupation, Poland, in particular, was the state most devastated by these crimes, with 90% of its Jews as well as many ethnic Poles slaughtered by the Nazis and their affiliates. After the war, from 1945\u201349, the Nazi regime was put on trial in two\n\ntribunals\n\nin\n\nNuremberg\n\n, Germany by the victorious\n\nAllied powers\n\n.\n\nThe\n\nfirst tribunal\n\nindicted\n\n24 major Nazi war criminals, and resulted in 19\n\nconvictions\n\n(of which 12 led to\n\ndeath sentences\n\n) and 3\n\nacquittals\n\n, 2 of the accused died before a verdict was rendered, at least one of which by killing himself with cyanide.\n\n[50]\n\nThe\n\nsecond tribunal\n\nindicted 185 members of the military, economic, and political leadership of Nazi Germany, of which 142 were convicted and 35 were acquitted. In subsequent decades, approximately 20 additional war criminals who escaped capture in the immediate aftermath of World War II were tried in\n\nWest Germany\n\nand Israel.

In 1958, all charges were dropped and sentences were reduced. |                                                                                                                  Following the US invasion of Luzon in 1944, the Japanese high command ordered that all POWs remaining in the island are to be exterminated at all cost. As a result, on December 14, 1944, units from the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army  stationed in the Puerto Princesa POW camp in Palawan rounded up 150 remaining POWs still garrisoned in the camp, herded them into air raid shelters, before dousing the shelters with gasoline and setting it on fire. Of the handful of POWs that were able to escape the flames were hunted before being gunned down, bayonetted, or burned alive. Only 11 POWs survived the ordeal and were able to escape to Allied lines to report the incident.[75] | \n|                     Alexandra Hospital massacre , Battle of Singapore , 1942 |                                                                                                                                                                          War crimes |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                no prosecutions |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   At about 1pm on February 14, Japanese approached Alexandra Barracks Hospital.

A directive dated 20 December 1941, addressed to newly appointed commanders in Montenegro, Major \u0110or\u0111ije La\u0161i\u0107 and Captain Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, outlined, among other things, the cleansing of all non-Serb elements in order to create a Greater Serbia:\n\n[91]\n\nThe struggle for the liberty of our whole nation under the scepter of His Majesty King Peter II;\n\nthe creation of a Great Yugoslavia and within it of a\n\nGreat Serbia\n\nwhich is to be ethnically pure and is to include Serbia,\n\nMontenegro\n\n,\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\n,\n\nSrijem\n\n, the\n\nBanat\n\n, and\n\nBa\u010dka\n\n;\n\nthe struggle for the inclusion into Yugoslavia of all still unliberated Slovene territories under the Italians and Germans (\n\nTrieste\n\n,\n\nGorizia\n\n,\n\nIstria\n\n, and\n\nCarinthia\n\n) as well as Bulgaria, and northern\n\nAlbania\n\nwith\n\nSkadar\n\n;\n\nthe cleansing of the state territory of all national minorities and a-national elements;\n\nthe creation of contiguous frontiers between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and\n\nSlovenia\n\nby cleansing the Muslim population from\n\nSand\u017eak\n\nand the Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\u2014\n\nDirective of 20 December 1941\n\n[91]\n\nChetniks in\n\n\u0160umadija\n\nkill a Partisan through heart extraction\n\nThe Chetniks systemically massacred Muslims in villages that they captured.\n\n[92]\n\nIn late autumn of 1941 the Italians handed over the towns of Vi\u0161egrad, Gora\u017ede, Fo\u010da and the surrounding areas, in south-east Bosnia to the Chetniks to run as a puppet administration and NDH forces were compelled by the Italians to withdraw from there. After the Chetniks gained control of\n\nGora\u017ede\n\non 29 November 1941, they began a massacre of Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials that became a systematic massacre of the local Muslim civilian population.\n\n[93]\n\nSeveral hundred Muslims were murdered and their bodies were left hanging in the town or thrown into the Drina river.\n\n[93]\n\nOn 5 December 1941, the Chetniks received the town of\n\nFo\u010da\n\nfrom the Italians and proceeded to massacre around 500 Muslims.\n\n[93]\n\nAdditional massacres against the Muslims in the area of Fo\u010da took place in August 1942. In total, more than 2000 people were killed in Fo\u010da.\n\n[94]\n\nIn early January, Chetniks entered\n\nSrebrenica\n\nand killed around 1000 Muslim civilians there and in nearby villages. Around the same time the Chetniks made their way to\n\nVi\u0161egrad\n\nwhere deaths were reportedly in the thousands.\n\n[95]\n\nMassacres continued in the following months in the region.\n\n[96]\n\nIn the village of\n\n\u017depa\n\nalone about three hundred were killed in late 1941.\n\n[96]\n\nIn early January, Chetniks massacred fifty-four Muslims in\n\n\u010celebi\u0107\n\nand burned down the village. On 3 March, Chetniks burned forty-two Muslim villagers to death in Drakan.\n\n[95]\n\nIn early January 1943 and again in early February, Montenegrin Chetnik units were ordered to carry out \"cleansing actions\" against Muslims, first in the\n\nBijelo Polje\n\ncounty in Sand\u017eak and then in February in the\n\n\u010cajni\u010de\n\ncounty and part of Fo\u010da county in southeastern Bosnia, and in part of the\n\nPljevlja\n\ncounty in Sand\u017eak.\n\n[97]\n\nPavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107\n\n, the officer in charge of these operations, reported to Mihailovi\u0107, Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command, that on 10 January 1943: \"thirty-three Muslim villages had been burned down, and 400 Muslim fighters (members of the Muslim self-protection militia supported by the Italians) and about 1,000 women and children had been killed, as against 14 Chetnik dead and 26 wounded\".\n\n[97]\n\nIn another report sent by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 dated 13 February 1943, he reported that: \"Chetniks killed about 1,200 Muslim fighters and about 8,000 old people, women, and children; Chetnik losses in the action were 22 killed and 32 wounded\".\n\n[97]\n\nHe added that \"during the operation the total destruction of the Muslim inhabitants was carried out regardless of sex and age\".\n\n[98]\n\nThe total number of deaths caused by the anti-Muslim operations between January and February 1943 is estimated at 10,000.\n\n[97]\n\nThe casualty rate would have been higher had a great number of Muslims not already fled the area, most to\n\nSarajevo\n\n, when the February action began.\n\n[97]\n\nAccording to a statement from the Chetnik Supreme Command from 24 February 1943, these were countermeasures taken against Muslim aggressive activities; however, all circumstances show that these massacres were committed in accordance with implementing the directive of 20 December 1941.\n\n[94]\n\nActions against the Croats were of a smaller scale but comparable in action.\n\n[99]\n\nIn early October 1942 in the village of\n\nGata\n\n, where an estimated 100 people were killed and many homes burnt in reprisal taken for the destruction of roads in the area carried out on the Italians' account.\n\n[94]\n\nThat same month, formations under the command of Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 and Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107, who were participating in the Italian\n\nOperation Alfa\n\nin the area of\n\nProzor\n\n, massacred over 500 Croats and Muslims and burnt numerous villages.\n\n[94]\n\nBa\u0107ovi\u0107 noted that \"Our Chetniks killed all men 15 years of age or older.\u00a0... Seventeen villages were burned to the ground.\"\n\n[100]\n\nMario Roatta\n\n, commander of the\n\nItalian Second Army\n\n, objected to these \"massive slaughters\" of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end.\n\n[100]\n\nCrimes perpetrated by the Ustashas\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe\n\nUsta\u0161a\n\nintended to create an ethnically \"pure\"\n\nGreater Croatia\n\n, and they viewed those\n\nSerbs\n\nthen living in Croatia,\n\nBosnia\n\nand\n\nHerzegovina\n\nas the biggest obstacle to this goal. Ustasha ministers\n\nMile Budak\n\n, Mirko Puk and Milovan \u017dani\u0107 declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustasha policy was an ethnically pure Croatia. The strategy to achieve their goal was:\n\n[101]\n\n[102]\n\nOne-third of the Serbs were to be killed\n\nOne-third of the Serbs were to be expelled\n\nOne-third of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to\n\nCatholicism\n\nThe\n\nIndependent State of Croatia\n\ngovernment cooperated with Nazi Germany in\n\nthe Holocaust\n\nand exercised their own version of the\n\ngenocide\n\nagainst Serbs, as well as\n\nJews\n\nand\n\nGypsies\n\n(Roma) (aka \"gypsies\") inside its borders. State policy towards Serbs had first been declared in the words of Milovan \u017dani\u0107, a minister of the NDH Legislative council, on 2 May 1941:\n\nUsta\u0161a soldiers sawing off the head of Branko Jungi\u0107, an ethnic Serb, near\n\nBosanska Gradi\u0161ka\n\n.\n\nThis country can only be a Croatian country, and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given the opportunity.\n\n[103]\n\nAccording to the\n\nSimon Wiesenthal Center\n\n(citing the\n\nEncyclopedia of the Holocaust\n\n), \"Ustasa terrorists killed 500,000 Serbs, expelled 250,000 and forced 250,000 to convert to Roman Catholicism. They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies.\"\n\n[104]\n\nThe execution methods used by the Ustasha were particularly brutal and sadistic and often included torture, dismemberment or decapitation.\n\n[105]\n\nA Gestapo report to Heinrich Himmler from 1942 stated, \"The Usta\u0161e committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age but especially against helpless old people, women and children.\"\n\n[106]\n\nNumerous concentration camps were built in the NDH, most notably\n\nJasenovac\n\n, the largest, where around 100,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma, as well as a number of Croatian political dissidents, died, mostly from torture and starvation.\n\n[107]\n\nIt was established in August 1941 and not dismantled until April 1945, shortly before the end of the war. Jasenovac was a complex of five subcamps and three smaller camps spread out over 240 square kilometers (93\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), in relatively close proximity to each other, on the bank of the Sava river.\n\n[108]\n\nMost of the camp was at\n\nJasenovac\n\n, about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southeast of\n\nZagreb\n\n. The complex also included large grounds at Donja Gradina directly across the\n\nSava River\n\n, the\n\nJastrebarsko children's camp\n\nto the northwest, and the\n\nStara Gradi\u0161ka camp\n\n(Jasenovac V) for women and children to the southeast.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nUnlike Nazi camps, most murders at Jasenovac were done manually using hammers, axes, knives and other implements.\n\n[109]\n\nAccording to testimony, on the night of August 29, 1942, guards at the camp organized a competition to see who could slaughter the most inmates, with guard and former\n\nFranciscan\n\npriest\n\nPetar Brzica\n\nwinning by cutting the throats of 1,360 inmates.\n\n[109]\n\nA special knife called a \"Srbosjek\" (Serb-cutter) was designed for the slaughtering of prisoners.\n\n[110]\n\nPrisoners were sometimes tied with barbed wire, then taken to a ramp near to the\n\nSava River\n\nwhere weights were placed on the wires, their throats and stomachs slashed before their bodies were dumped into the river.\n\n[109]\n\nAfter unsuccessful experiments with gas vans, camp commander\n\nVjekoslav Luburi\u0107\n\nhad a gas chamber built at Jasenovac V, where a considerable number of inmates were killed during a three-month experiment with sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B, but this method was abandoned due to poor construction.\n\n[111]\n\nThe Ustashe cremated living inmates as well as corpses.\n\n[112]\n\n[113]\n\nOther methods of torture and killing done included: inserting hot nails under finger nails, mutilating parts of the body including plucking out eyeballs, tightening chains around ones head until the skull fractured and the eyes popped and also, placing salt in open wounds.\n\n[114]\n\nWomen were subjected to rape and torture,\n\n[115]\n\nincluding breast mutilation.\n\n[116]\n\nPregnant women had their wombs cut out.\n\n[117]\n\nAn escape attempt on 22 April 1945 by 600 male inmates failed and only 84 male prisoners escaped successfully.\n\n[118]\n\nThe remainder and about 400 other prisoners were then murdered by Ustasha guards, despite the fact that they knew the war was ending with Germany's capitulation.\n\n[119]\n\nAll the female inmates from the women's camp (more than 700) had been massacred by the guards the previous day.\n\n[119]\n\nThe guards then destroyed the camp and everything associated with it was burned to the ground.\n\n[119]\n\nOther concentration camps were the\n\n\u0110akovo camp\n\n,\n\nGospi\u0107 camp\n\n,\n\nJadovno camp\n\n,\n\nKru\u0161\u010dica camp\n\nand the\n\nLepoglava camp\n\n.\n\nUstasha militias and death squads also burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian Serbs in the country-side in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools. Men, women, children were hacked to death, thrown alive into pits and down ravines, or set on fire in churches.\n\n[120]\n\nSome Serb villages near\n\nSrebrenica\n\nand\n\nOzren\n\nwere wholly massacred, while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between\n\nVlasenica\n\nand\n\nKladanj\n\n.\n\n[121]\n\nThe\n\nGlina massacres\n\n, where thousands of Serbs were killed, are among the more notable instances of Ustasha cruelty.\n\nAnte Paveli\u0107\n\n, leader of the Ustasha, fled to Argentina and Spain which gave him protection, and was never extradited to stand trial for his war crimes. Paveli\u0107 died on 28 December 1959 at the Hospital Alem\u00e1n in\n\nMadrid\n\n, where the Roman Catholic church had helped him to gain asylum, at the age of 70 from gunshot wounds sustained in an earlier assassination attempt by Montenegrin\n\nBlagoje Jovovi\u0107\n\n.\n\n[122]\n\nSome other prominent Ustashe figures and their respective fates:\n\nAndrija Artukovi\u0107\n\n, Croatian Minister of Interior. Died in Croatian custody.\n\nMile Budak, Croatian politician and chief Ustashe ideologist. Tried and executed by Yugoslav authorities.\n\nPetar Brzica, Franciscan friar who won a throat-cutting contest at Jasenovac. Post-war fate unknown.\n\nMiroslav Filipovi\u0107\n\n, camp commander and Franciscan friar notorious for his cruelty and sadism. Tried and executed by Yugoslav authorities.\n\nSlavko Kvaternik\n\n, Ustashe military commander-in-chief. Tried and executed by Yugoslav authorities.\n\nVjekoslav \"Maks\" Luburi\u0107, commander of the Usta\u0161e Defence Brigades (\n\nUsta\u0161ka Odbrana\n\n) and Jasenovac camp. Murdered in Spain.\n\nDinko \u0160aki\u0107\n\n, Ustashe commander of Jasenovac. Fled to Argentina, extradited to Croatia for trial in 1998. Sentenced to 20 years and died in prison in 2008.\n\nMost Ustashe fled the country following the war, mainly with the help of Father\n\nKrunoslav Draganovi\u0107\n\n, secretary of the\n\nCollege of Sian Girolamo\n\nwho helped Ustasha fugitives immigrate illegally to South America.\n\n[123]\n\nCrimes perpetrated by the Ukrainian nationalists\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe Ukrainian\n\nOUN-B\n\ngroup, along with their military force \u2013\n\nUkrainian Insurgent Army\n\n(UPA) \u2013 are responsible for a\n\ngenocide on the Polish population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia\n\n. Starting in March 1943, with its peak in the summer 1943, as many as 80,000 -100,000. Although the main target were\n\nPoles\n\n, many\n\nJews\n\n,\n\nCzechs\n\nand those\n\nUkrainians\n\nunwilling to participate in the crimes, were massacred as well. Lacking good armament and ammunition, UPA members commonly used tools such as axes and pitchforks for the slaughter. As a result of these massacres, almost the entire non-Ukrainian population of Volhynia was either killed or forced to flee. However, the premix of this ethnic cleansing was the war of Polish partisan Homeland Army against Ukraine, in which Poland wanted to re-occupy Western Ukraine, treacherously captured in 1921. Homeland Army committed a genocide of Ukrainians during this conquest campaign, killed as many as 15000 mostly in near-border villages and practiced unprecedented cruelty against UPA partisans.\n\nUPA commanders responsible for the genocide:\n\nRoman Shukhevych\n\n- general of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. As a leader of the UPA he was to be aware and to approve the project of ethnic cleansing in\n\nVolhynia\n\nand Eastern Galicia.\n\nDmytro Klyachkivsky\n\n- colonel of the UPA. He gave the order \"to wipe out an entire Polish male population between 16 and 60 years old\" (according to the research of the Ukrainian historians, this citation may be falsified by the Soviet intelligence). Klyachkivsky is regarded as the main initiator of the massacres.\n\nMykola Lebed\n\n- one of the OUN leaders, and UPA fighter. By the National Archives, he is described as \"Ukrainian fascist leader and suspected\n\nNazi\n\ncollaborator\"\n\nStepan Bandera\n\n- leader of the OUN-B. His view was to remove all Poles, who were hostile towards the OUN, and assimilate the rest of them. The role of the main architect of the massacres is often assigned to him. However, he was imprisoned in German concentration camp since 1941, so there is a strong suspicion, that he wasn't fully aware of events in Volhynia.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nAllied powers\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nAllied war crimes during World War II\n\nCrimes perpetrated by the Soviet Union\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nSoviet war crimes\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Concurrent with World War II | \n|                                                                                                                                   Incident |                                          type of crime |                                                                 Persons responsible |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Notes | \n|                                                                                                                            Katy\u0144 massacre |           War crimes (Murder of Polish intelligentsia) |                                  Lavrenty Beria , Joseph Stalin [124]  [125]  [126] |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           An NKVD -committed massacre of tens of thousands of Polish officers and intelligentsia throughout the spring of 1940.

It was recaptured by the Germans soon afterwards and the German authorities reported that the Red Army killed civilians there. Nazi  propaganda widely disseminated the description of the event with horrible details, supposedly to boost the determination of German soldiers to resist the general Soviet advance. Because the incident was investigated by the Nazis and reports were disseminated as Nazi propaganda, discerning the facts from the fiction of the incident is difficult. | \n| Invasion of East Prussia Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II Expulsion of Germans after World War II |     War crimesCrimes against humanity (mass expulsion) |                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 War crimes committed against German civilian population by the Red Army in occupied Eastern and Central Germany, and against ethnic-German populations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Jugoslavia.

On two occasions, once off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt , and the other off the coast of Crete , the crew attacked and killed dozens of shipwrecked German sailors and troops. None of the shipwrecked survivors posed a major threat to Torbay's  crew. Miers made no attempt to hide his actions, and reported them in his official logs. He received a strongly worded reprimand from his superiors following the first incident. Meir's actions violated the Hague Convention of 1907, which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances.[138]  [139] | \n|                  Sinking of German hospital ship Tubingen |                     War crimes (attacking hospital ships) |                                                                                                                               no prosecutions |         On 18 November 1944, the German hospital ship  Tubingen  was sunk by two British Beaufighter  bombers off Pola , in the Adriatic Sea .

Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer described in January 1950 the convictions of German prisoners of war in Yugoslavia as \"crimes and crimes against humanity\".[152] | In Yugoslavia in particular, with many exceptions, the Danube Swabian minority \"collaborated . . . with the occupation\".[153]   Consequently, on November 21, 1944 the Presidium of the AVNOJ (the Yugoslav parliament) declared the ethnic German minority in Yugoslavia collectively hostile to the Yugoslav state. The AVNOJ Presidium issued a decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property of Nazi Germany and its citizens in Yugoslavia, persons of ethnic German nationality (regardless of citizenship), and collaborators. The decision acquired the force of law on February 6, 1945.[154]   Of a pre-war population of about 350,000 ethnic Germans in the Vojvodina, the 1958 census revealed 32,000 left. Officially, Yugoslavia denied the forcible starvation and killing of their Schwowisch populations, but reconstruction of the labor camps reveals that of the 170,000 Danube Swabians interned from 1944 to 1948, over 50,000 died of mistreatment.[155]    About 55,000 people died in the concentration camps, another 31,000 died serving in the German armed forces, and about 31,000 disappeared, mostly likely dead, with another 37,000 still unaccounted for. Thus the total victims of the war and subsequent ethnic cleansing and killings comprised about 30% of the pre-war German population.[156]   In addition, 35,000\u201340,000 Swabian children under age sixteen were separated from their parents and force into prison camps and re-education orphanages. Many were adopted by Serbian Partisan families.[157] | \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1946\u20131954: Indochina War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe French Union's struggle against the\n\nindependence movement\n\nbacked by the Soviet Union and China claimed 500,000 to 1.5 million Vietnamese lives from 1945 to 1954.\n\n[158]\n\nIn the\n\nHaiphong massacre\n\nof 1946, about 6,000 Vietnamese were killed by naval artillery.\n\n[158]\n\nThe French employed electric shock treatment during interrogations of the Vietnamese, and nearly 10,000 Vietnamese perished in French concentration camps.\n\n[158]\n\n1947\u20131948: Malagasy Uprising\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe French repressed the\n\nindependence movement\n\nwith killings and village burnings.

Commanders feared enemy infiltrators among such refugee columns. Estimates of the dead have ranged from dozens to 500. In 2005, a South Korean government committee certified the names of 163 dead or missing and 55 wounded and added that many other victims' names were not reported.[166]   The South Korean

Throughout the conflict, North Korean and Chinese forces routinely mistreated U.S. and UN prisoners of war. Mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run\n\nPOW camps\n\nduring the winter of 1950\u201351. About 43 percent of all U.S. POWs died during this period. In violation of the\n\nGeneva Conventions\n\nwhich explicitly stated that captor states must\n\nrepatriate\n\nprisoners of war to their homeland as quickly as possible, North Korea detained South Korean POWs for decades after the ceasefire. Over 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the Communists' themselves had claimed they had captured 70,000 South Koreans.\n\n[172]\n\n[173]\n\n:\n\n141\n\nSouth Korean perpetrated crimes\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                                                                  Armed conflict |                                                                          Perpetrator | \n|                                                                                      Korean War |                                                                          South Korea | \n|                       Incident |                                                  Type of crime | Persons responsible |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Notes | \n|                  Jeju uprising | War crimes, Crimes against humanity (mass murder of civilians) |         South Korea |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The island of Jeju was considered a stronghold of the Korean independence movement  and the South Korean Labor Party . .[174]  :166\u2013167  [175]   Syngman Rhee  had proclaimed martial law to quell an insurgency.[176]   Up to 10% of the island's population died (14,000 to 30,000) as a result of the conflict,[174]  :195  [177]  :13   and another 40,000 fled to Japan.[175] | \n|           Bodo League massacre | War crimes, Crimes against humanity (mass murder of civilians) |         South Korea |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Bodo League massacre (Korean :\u00a0\ubcf4\ub3c4\uc5f0\ub9f9 \uc0ac\uac74 ; Hanja :\u00a0\u4fdd\u5c0e\u806f\u76df\u4e8b\u4ef6 ) was a massacre  and war crime  against communists  and suspected sympathisers that occurred in the summer of 1950 during the Korean War .

In response to the rebellion, many Kikuyu were relocated. 320,000\u2013450,000 of them were moved into\n\nconcentration camps\n\n. Most of the remainder \u2013 more than a million \u2013 were held in \"enclosed villages\". Although some were Mau Mau guerillas, many were victims of\n\ncollective punishment\n\nthat colonial authorities imposed on large areas of the country. Thousands suffered beatings and\n\nsexual assaults\n\nduring \"screenings\" intended to extract information about the Mau Mau threat. Later, prisoners suffered even worse mistreatment in an attempt to force them to renounce their allegiance to the insurgency and to obey commands. Significant numbers were murdered; official accounts describe some prisoners being roasted alive. Prisoners were questioned with the help of \"slicing off ears, boring holes in eardrums, flogging until death, pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight, and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes\". British soldiers used a \"metal\n\ncastrating\n\ninstrument\" to cut off testicles and fingers. \"By the time I cut his balls off\", one settler boasted, \"he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.\" According to David Anderson, the British hanged over 1,090 suspected rebels: far more than the French had executed in\n\nAlgeria\n\nduring the\n\nAlgerian War\n\n.\n\n[185]\n\nIt was found out that over half of them executed were not rebels at all. Thousands more were killed by British soldiers, who claimed they had \"failed to halt\" when challenged.\n\n[186]\n\n[187]\n\n[185]\n\nThe\n\nChuka Massacre\n\n, which happened in\n\nChuka, Kenya\n\n, was perpetrated by members of the\n\nKing's African Rifles\n\nB Company in June 1953 with 20 unarmed people killed during the Mau Mau uprising. Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on June 13, 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. It is found out that most of the people executed were actually belonged to the\n\nKikuyu Home Guard\n\n\u2013 a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight an increasingly powerful and audacious guerrilla enemy. In an atmosphere of atrocity and reprisal, the matter was swept under the carpet and nobody ever stood trial for the massacre.\n\nThe\n\nHola massacre\n\nwas an incident during the conflict in\n\nKenya\n\nagainst\n\nBritish colonial rule\n\nat a colonial detention camp in\n\nHola, Kenya\n\n. By January 1959 the camp had a population of 506 detainees of whom 127 were held in a secluded \"closed camp\". This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial \"rehabilitation process\" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action \u2013 as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.\n\n[188]\n\n77 surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries.\n\n[\n\ncitation needed\n\n]\n\nThe British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability.\n\n[189]\n\nThe Lari massacre in the settlement of\n\nLari\n\noccurred on the night of 25\u201326 March 1953, in which Mau Mau militants herded Kikuyu men, women and children into huts and set fire to them, killing anyone who attempted to escape. Official estimates place the death toll from the Lari massacre at 74 dead.\n\n[190]\n\nMau Mau militants also tortured, mutilated and murdered Kikuyu on many occasions.\n\n[191]\n\nMau Mau racked up 1,819 murders of their fellow Africans, though again this number excludes the many additional hundreds who 'disappeared', whose bodies were never found.\n\n[192]\n\n1954\u20131962: Algerian War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nThe insurgency began in 1945 and was\n\nrevived in 1954\n\n, winning independence in the early 1960s. The French army killed thousands of Algerians in the first round of fighting in 1945.\n\n[158]\n\nAfter the Algerian independence movement formed a National Liberation Front (FLN) in 1954, the French Minister of the Interior joined the Minister of National Defense in 1955 in ordering that every rebel carrying a weapon, suspected of doing so, or suspected of fleeing, must be shot.\n\n[158]\n\nFrench troops executed civilians from nearby villages when rebel attacks occurred, tortured both rebels and civilians, and interned Arabs in camps, where forced labor was required of some of them.\n\n[158]\n\n2,000,000 Algerians were displaced or forcibly resettled during the war.\n\n[193]\n\nOther French crimes included deliberate bombing, torture and mutilation of civilians, imprisonment\n\nwithout food\n\nin small cells, throwing prisoners\n\nout of helicopters to their death\n\nor into the sea with concrete on their feet, and\n\nburying people alive\n\n.\n\n[194]\n\n[195]\n\n[196]\n\n[197]\n\nThe FLN also indulged in a large amount of atrocities, both against French\n\npieds-noirs\n\nand against fellow Algerians whom they deemed as supporting the French or simply as refusing to support the Liberation effort.\n\n[198]\n\nThese crimes included killing unarmed children, women and the elderly, rape and\n\ndisembowelment\n\nor decapitation of women and murdering children by slitting their throats or banging their heads against walls..\n\n[199]\n\nFrench sources estimated that 70,000 Muslim civilians were killed, or abducted and presumed killed, by the FLN during the war. The FLN also killed 30,000 to 150,000 in people in post-war reprisals.\n\n[200]\n\n1955\u20131975: Vietnam War\n\n[\n\nedit\n\n]\n\nMain article:\n\nVietnam War \u00a7\u00a0War crimes\n\nSee

August 1965 Lcpl McGhee of Company M, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines , walked through Marine lines at Chu Lai Base Area  toward a nearby village. In answer to a Marine sentry's shouted question, he responded that he was going after a VC. Two Marines were dispatched to retrieve McGhee and as they approached the village they heard a shot and a woman's scream and then saw McGhee walking toward them from the village. McGhee said he had just killed a VC and other VC were following him. At trial Vietnamese prosecution witnesses testified that McGhee had kicked through the wall of the hut where their family slept. He seized a 14-year-old girl and pulled her toward the door. When her father interceded, McGhee shot and killed him. Once outside the house the girl escaped McGhee with the help of her grandmother. McGhee was found guilty of unpremeditated murder and sentenced him to confinement at hard labor for ten years. On appeal this was reduced to 7 years and he actually served 6 years and 1 month.[201]  :33\u20134 | \n|                           Xuan Ngoc (2) |                         Murder and rape |                                                                                                                            PFC John D. Potter, Jr.Hospitalman John R. BretagPFC James H. Boyd, Jr.Sergeant Ronald L. Vogel | On 23 September 1966, a nine-man ambush patrol from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines , left Hill 22, northwest of Chu Lai. Private First Class John D. Potter, Jr. took effective command of the patrol. They entered the hamlet of Xuan Ngoc (2) and seized Dao Quang Thinh, whom they accused of being a Viet Cong, and dragged him from his hut. While they beat him, other patrol members forced his wife, Bui Thi Huong, from their hut and four of them raped her. A few minutes later three other patrol members shot Dao Quang Thinh, Bui, their child, Bui's sister-in-law, and her sister in- law's child. Bui Thi Huong survived to testify at the courts-martial. The company commander suspicious of the reported \"enemy contact\" sent Second Lieutenant Stephen J. Talty, to return to the scene with the patrol. Once there, Talty realized what had happened and attempted to cover up the incident. A wounded child was discovered alive and Potter bludgeoned it to death with his rifle. Potter was convicted of premeditated murder and rape, and sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life, but was released in February 1978, having served 12 years and 1 month. Hospitalman John R. Bretag testified against Potter and was sentenced to 6 month's confinement for rape. PFC James H. Boyd, Jr., pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 4 years confinement at hard labor. Sergeant Ronald L. Vogel was convicted for murder of one of the children and rape and was sentenced to 50 years confinement at hard labor, which was reduced on appeal to 10 years, of which he served 9 years. Two patrol members were acquitted of major charges, but were convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and sentenced to 6 months' confinement. Lt Talty was found guilty of making a false report and dismissed from the Marine Corps, but this was overturned on appeal.[201]  :53\u20134  [202] | \n| Charles W. Keenan and Stanley J.

Allen led a 6-man ambush patrol from the 1st Battalion, 27th Marines  near Hu\u1ebf. They stopped and interrogated 2 unarmed Vietnamese men who Allen and Private Martin R. Alvarez then executed. After an attack on their base that night the unit sent out a patrol who brought back 3 Vietnamese men. Allen, Alvarez, Lance Corporals John D. Belknap, James A. Maushart, PFC Robert J. Vickers, and two others then formed a firing squad and executed 2 of the Vietnamese. The third captive was taken into a building where Allen, Belknap, and Anthony Licciardo, Jr., hanged him, when the rope broke Allen cut the man's throat, killing him. Allen pleaded guilty to five counts of unpremeditated murder and was sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life reduced to 20 years in exchange for the guilty plea. Allen's confinement was reduced to 7 years and he was paroled after having served only 2 years and 11 months confinement. Maushart pleaded guilty to one count of unpremeditated murder and was sentenced to 2 years confinement of which he served 1 year and 8 months. Belknap and Licciardo each pleaded guilty to single murders and were sentenced to 2 years confinement. Belknap served 15 months while Licciardo served his full sentence. Alvarez was found to lack mental responsibility and found not guilty. Vickers was found guilty of 2 counts of unpremeditated murder, but his convictions were overturned on review [201]  :111\u20134 | \n|   Ronald J. Reese and Stephen D.

The four shouted their discovery to those being observed by the ambush. Seized by the Marines, the four were bound, gagged, and led away by Corporal Ronald J. Reese and Lance Corporal Stephen D. Crider. Minutes later, the 4 children were seen, apparently dead, in a small bunker. The Marines tossed a fragmentation grenade into the bunker, which then collapsed the damaged structure atop the bodies. Reese and Crider were each convicted of 4 counts of murder and sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life.

With 1\u20133 million people killed in nine months, 'genocide' is the term that is used to describe the event in almost every major publication and newspaper.[243]  [244]   Although the word 'genocide' was and is still used frequently amongst observers and scholars of the events that transpired during the 1971 war, the allegations that a genocide took place during the Bangladesh War of 1971 were never investigated by an international tribunal set up under the auspices of the United Nations, due to complications arising from the Cold War. A process is underway in 2009\u20132010 to begin trials of some local war collaborators. | \n|                Civilian Casualties |                                                                                           War crimes |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      no prosecutions |                                                                      The number of civilians that died in the liberation war of Bangladesh is not known in any reliable accuracy.

This is the figure officially maintained by the Government of Bangladesh.

The exact numbers are not known and are a subject of debate. Bangladeshi sources cite a figure of 200,000 women raped, giving birth to thousands of war-babies. Some other sources, for example Susan Brownmiller , refer to an even higher number of over 400,000. Pakistani sources claim the number is much lower, though having not completely denied rape incidents.[250]  [251]  [252] | \n|           Killing of intellectuals |                                                                                           War crimes |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      no prosecutions |                                                                                                                                 During the war, the Pakistan Army and its local supporters carried out a systematic execution of the leading Bengali intellectuals.

It isn't just in Congo that trade-offs are being made. [...] Skeptics point out that those who have stood trial so far have either been defeated in war or are retired and irrelevant.
