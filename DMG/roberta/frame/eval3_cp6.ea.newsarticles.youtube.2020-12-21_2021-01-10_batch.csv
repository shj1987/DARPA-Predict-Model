Vertical Farming to Power Social Change August 28 2019 Kyle Baldock AVF Members 0 comments The AVF Welcomes Resource Oriented Development Initiatives RODI Kenya as its First Institutional Member from Africa RODI Kenya is one of the newest organisations to join AVF and our first company member from Africa We met RODI’s CEO and Executive Director Eliud Ngunjiri in Nairobi this past June at the 1 st International Conference on Agroecology Transforming Agriculture Food Systems in Africa Mr Ngunjiri has a background in rural social development working for the Kenyan government and Oxfam GB before leaving to start RODI He sat down with AVF Media to explain how RODI transforms and empowers Kenyan communities with modern agricultural practices A People and ResourcesCentred Approach to Social Change Mr Ngunjiri began by stressing the importance of the organisation’s name RODI stands for Resources Oriented Development Initiatives He pointed out how conventional development approaches put undue emphasis on the problems of a community instead of the resources with which they are endowed “Some aid agencies make matters worse when they say they work with the ‘poorest of the poor’ a scenario that makes communities want to prove they are the poorest of the poor in order to gain assistance” Instead RODI uses a resources oriented development approach RODA which encourages communities to identify and mobilise local resources their individual and communal resources and capabilities RODI has the following target groups Prisoners exprisoners and their home communities School pupils youth Community groups They provide training in organic sustainable agriculture agroprocessing and valueaddition modern agricultural technologies manufacturing organic farm inputsfertilisers and hygienesanitation materials and products The training is approved by the Kenyan Government’s National Industrial Training Authority NITA RODI’s Organisational Structure RODI is an NGO with an executive management board and a stakeholders’ forum Their mission is to promote human dignity among communities in Kenya and other East African Countries through enhanced food security health and crime prevention They employ 30 fulltime staff volunteers interns and students on field attachment that work within five departments of social uplift Social and Restorative Justice Health Sanitation and Gender Youth Empowerment and County and Development RODI Enterprises Finance and Administration Operations are split between field work they are active in 15 out of 47 counties in Kenya and their headquarters in Ruiru northeast Nairobi Here they have a full trainingconference facility with a vertical garden demonstration area capable of accommodating 48 people in self contained rooms dining hall and meeting rooms The challenges for food systems and citizens in Kenya Mr Ngunjiri drew a clear picture of the systematic pressures facing the people of Kenya and their food production systems He broke it down into three categories Global While their contribution to global warming is comparatively small the impact of climate change on Kenya is of serious concern As weather patterns become less predictable there is a vital need for mitigation and adaptation to climate change as well as disaster risk reduction RODI is working to improve the adaptability and resilience of food production systems in rural and urban areas starting from the community level Country Agriculture is very closely related to the shifting dynamics of poverty in Kenya According to the FAO “the sector employs more than 40 per cent of the total population and more than 70 per cent of Kenya’s rural people” But threequarters of Kenya’s land is aridsemiarid and unsuitable for rainfed crop production It is thought that as much as 365 of Kenya’s population is food insecure This land scarcityfood security equation is further impacted by the global phenomenon of ruralurban migration Rural individuals move to the city in search of greater earnings but employment is not readily available so they end up in slums with very few amenities Furthermore Kenya is a net importer of all staple foods They simply can’t produce enough food for their growing population which leads to an overuse of chemicals pesticides and fertilisers The soil pH in what little arable land there is has rapidly turned from alkaline to acidic and the soil quality is degrading by the day RODI uses its training facility and field work to show that urban agriculture solutions can be used to enhance food security in slums while also allowing the soil to regenerate for future use City Nairobi’s sewage and industrial effluent are channelled into the rivers this sewage is then used to irrigate crops and carcinogenic RoundUp is sprayed indiscriminately as herbicide to control weeds Producers rarely wait the required time for pesticide detox meaning that urban markets are inundated with unhealthy produce The country has recently experienced an outbreak of cancer so great that the citizens are pushing the government to declare it a national disaster The struggle for organic fertilisers and pest control Mr Ngunjiri identified the lack of organic inputs as a major problem organic fertilisers and pest control methods must be imported and are therefore expensive and rarely used This year according to the minister for agriculture the government is only able to supply about 40 of the country’s demand for cheap synthetic fertilisers Under RODI Enterprises the company produces biofertilisers and pesticides that are readily available and affordable for both rural and urban agriculture producers They want to scale this up by building dedicated organic fertiliser factories that will allow the country to transition to healthier more sustainable methods of intensive crop production RODI is looking for potential investors help make this endeavour a reality Notable projects working with RODI’s target groups RODI has a portfolio of projects that prove their leadership in transforming food systems and empowering its fellow citizens By focusing on their target groups they have implemented the following five projects 1 Coffee Production with Inmates RODI goes into prisons and instructs inmates on improved coffee management and upgrading to control coffee berry diseases including crop selection and rotation and improving resilience through organic pest management RODI follows up with the individuals once they leave prison and helps with their reintegration into society and entering the market as smallholder coffee producers Under RODI Enterprises RODI would like to establish a plant for organic coffee 2 Tea Production with Migrant Tea PickersWorkers Many of Kenya’s tea pickers are migrants who come from neighbouring counties and countries such as Uganda RODI works to improve living standards among tea pickers through their Programme for Enhancing Livelihoods in Tea Growing Areas 3 Training Centre in Ruiru 25km from Nairobi The training centre is a work in progress but it already includes a dining hall meeting rooms vertical gardens and accommodation for 48 people 4 Vertical Farming Institute Kenya RODI wants to develop a Vertical and Urban Farming Institute for all of Kenya a place for training research and demonstration of the latest appliedresearch technologies for food production 5 Moringa Tree Planting in Rural Areas The Moringa is a tree that does well in arid and semiarid lands and poor soils It provides fodder for livestock and the young bean pods are suitable for human consumption This agroforestry initiative is seen as a vital element of food security in arid lands Vertical Farming Institute Kenya It is with the Vertical Farming Institute idea in mind that Mr Ngunjiri comes to the AVF He wants to develop the centre on 11 acres of land on the slopes of Mt Kenya He will use his expertise connections and land access to recruit interest from corporations who want to devote their Corporate Social Responsibility CSR resources to promote vertical farming in Africa as well as universities hotels and hospitals who want to use the technologies for research food production and medicinal applications The VFI will focus on strategies with direct application to the communities most in need especially the denselypopulated slums which lack amenities and access to healthy food These models include the Pyramid see photos below a 1m 2 vertical garden which uses recycled dam liners green walls and hanging gardens and strategically potted plants and climbing plants With the VFI RODI will focus on its target groups of prisoners exprisoners and their home communities students and youth and community groups They will support and teach these individuals to become peer educators and community trainers to create a sustainable system of urban agriculture development Getting in touch with RODI Kenya RODI is eager to partner with international experts in the field of vertical farming Mr Ngunjiri’s goal in joining the AVF is transactional he wants RODI to build awareness of Kenya’s agriculture in the AVF network he also wants to bring awareness of vertical farming to Kenyans He believes that both parties can benefit from joint projects and that each will help the other to campaign advocate and lobby for vertical farming in their respective locations Find out more about RODI Kenya by visiting their website httpswwwrodikenyaorg Email RODI at rodikenyaiconnectcoke Connect with RODI on Facebook

wrong Slate Wuerthner George Allan Savory Myth and Reality The Wildlife News November 2013 ADDITIONAL NOTES i NOTE In 2013 the UNFAO lowered livestock’s GHG emissions to 145 There are many other factors to consider in terms of level of concern we should have regarding the role of food choice in climate change global depletion in general and certain applicable time lines as represented or misrepresented by the United Nations or any other governing or research institution In particular 1 does not represent the entire life cycle analysis LCA or supply chain of livestock products notably omitting carbon dioxide production in respiration on average 48 tons CO2 eyearcow 23 CO2 eyearpig etc provides no consideration for increased indirect radiative effects of methane on atmospheric aerosols and particulate capture related to smog Shindell et al 2009 and manages land use changes LUC with admitted “uncertainty” and undercountingreporting 2 ultimately defers to a separate category for reporting of greenhouse gas emissions related to “deforestation” 20 of global GHG emissions per UNREDD of which livestock and feed crops play a significant role needing to be added to direct emissions 80 of Amazonian rainforest deforestation and degradation and destruction of Cerrado savanna since 1970 has been due to expansion for cattle with another 10 loss due to planting crops to feed them and other livestock 3 the global warming potential GWP for methane used in this report was from IPCC 2007 which was 21 at 100 years However the GWP of methane is actually 86 GWP at 20 years 4 the report gave no consideration to carbon sequestration potential lost on land now used for livestock and feed production which should have been considered as emissions 45 of the land mass on Earth now used by livestock and crops to feed them–International Livestock Research Institute 5 Consideration should be given to the fact that the lead authors have potential bias in this report Pierre Gerber is the Livestock Policy Officer of the FAO and Henning Steinfeld is Chief Livestock Information of the Livestock Sector Policy Branch of the FAO There is little doubt why obvious omissions were therefore seen in their conclusions presented “ The global livestock sector is faced with a threefold challenge increasing production to meet demand adapting to a changing and increasingly variable economic and natural environment and lastly improving its environmental performance “ This FAO report failed to represent urgency in regard to climate change and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions performed no analysis of alternatives and failed to present risks versus benefits of raising livestock on a global scale 1 there was no consideration of the effects of raising livestock on continued warming acidification deoxygenation and therefore diminished climate regulatory mechanisms of our oceans or time lines related to potential detrimental effects on the oxygennitrogencarbon dioxide cycling capacities 2 the report gave no account for anthropogenic greenhouse gases generated by agricultural systems related to extraction or raising and eating fish–fuel refrigeration packaging processing transportation etc for both wild caught operations as well as those pertaining to aquacultureaquaponicsaeroponics which would thereby provide a more accurate and complete agricultural portrait related to our food choices making it easier for policy makers and consumers to interpret the data and findings 3 there is no discussion in an overview sense to provide clarity regarding the component this happens to represent in livestock’s role or food choice for that matter in our current state of unsustainability and the interrelated issues we face–freshwater scarcity collapse of sea life oceanic ecosystems unprecedented extinctions and loss of biodiversity food security and agricultural land use inefficiencies implications in human health and disease rising health care costs and loss of productivity economic risk factors questions of social justice and implications regarding future generations etc many of these issues are irreversible in our lifetime–all part of the task of basic but thorough environmental scientific assessment perhaps beyond the scope of livestock researchersproponents for this one report but the critical connection and relevance are vital should have been mentioned neverthelessIt is quite clear by this report which presents a filtered and quite limited view of the role of livestock in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and global depletion that our team should focus our attention on why there is suppression of information lack of clarity or elucidation of facts by our leaders related to the overarching problem of animal based agriculture as a component of food choice–and then how to swiftly correct this Global governmental institutions such as the United Nations and its FAO should examine all the facts and present them accordingly as they interrelate Then they should be able to call for the frank elimination or comprehensive “replacement” of imminent threats to our survival such as food choices and agricultural systems that are disease promoting ecologically unsustainable and which condone massive unnecessary slaughtering–rather than calling for their perpetuation i Some have challenged that the 18 of GHG emissions from animal ag cannot be compared to the 13 of GHG for transportation emissions because it does not take into consideration the full lifecycle analysis of the transportation industry We have made it clear in the film that 13 of GHG emissions only accounts for the exhaust from the worlds vehicles ii Although there are Cornell studies citing the water consumption of the US livestock industry at over 66 trillion gallons every year we decided to go with a much more conservative figure of 34 trillion gallons based off the 2005 USGS figures putting the US total consumptive water use at 76 trillion gallons annually nonconsumptive is for thermoelectric and hydroelectric use that is typically returned directly back to its source immediately The USDA says that agriculture is responsible for 8090 percent of US water consumption and growing the feed crops for livestock consumes 56 of that water bringing the total water consumption of the livestock industry to 34 trillion gallons iii 1 burger 2 months showering based on taking a 4minute daily shower with a 25 gpm shower head iv “A typical fiveacre hog waste lagoon releases 1530 tons of ammonia into the air annually Approximately half of the ammonia rises as a gas and generally falls to forests fields or open water within 50 miles either in rain or fog The rest is transformed into dry particles that travel up to 250 miles Ammonia is the most potent form of nitrogen that triggers algae blooms and causes fish kills in coastal waters The North Carolina Division of Water Quality estimates that hog factories constitute the largest source of airborne ammonia in North Carolina more than cattle chickens and turkeys combined In 1995 Hans Paerl a marine ecologist from the University of North Carolina reported that airborne ammonia had risen 25 each year since 1991 in Morehead City 90 miles downwind of the hog belt” v Dairy Cows 120 lbs of waste per day x 932 million dairy cows Cows 63 lbs of waste per day

small and medium sized cities A farm with 2500 dairy cattle is similar in waste load to a city of 411000 people” On a 1000pound live weight basis each of these animals produces more waste than a human A CAFO with 1000 animal units of turkeys produces a waste load comparable to a city of 87700 people A dairy CAFO with 1000 animal units is equivalent to a city of 164500 people The important

actually consumes very little water The water is used to power turbines or for cooling and is almost always returned to the source immediately Agriculture is the largest consumer of water because it pulls water from the source and locks it up in products not returning it to the source immediately if ever xvi 414 billion of externalized costs breaks down to 314 billion in healthcare costs 38

raised on that same acre of land regardless of the level of fertility of that particular acre of land presuming it is the same acre used for either product animal or plant based xviii Many organizations are studying humanity’s effect on soil degradation erosion and eventual desertification but not willing to emphasize the final connection of dots to animal agriculture According to the UNCCD United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification nearly 20 million acres of arable land is lost each year due to desertification and the primary reasons are 1 deforestation due to cultivation of crops and pasture 2 overgrazing from livestock “eating away grasses and eroding topsoil with hooves” 3 intensive farming stripping away nutrients in soil httpwwwunorgeneventsdesertificationdaybackgroundshtml Overgrazing by livestock is the principal land problem related to desertification as indicated in the article httpwwwciesincolumbiaedudocs002186002186html And according to the UNDDD “Nearly 20 of the degrading land globally is cropland and 2025 rangeland” Understanding that over 70 of the global arable land used for agriculture is planted for crops grown for livestock there is be ample support for the statement that “animal agriculture is the leading driver for approximately 13 of the land lost on earth due to desertification” httpwwwunorgeneventsdesertificationdecadewhynowshtml xix Few prominent scientists will openly proclaim the connection of their research findings with the need to eliminate animal agriculture or promotion of fully plant based nutrition This is an observation that spans all aspects of global depletion related to food choice including the topic of loss of biodiversity and extinction of species The statement that animal agriculture is the primary driver of biodiversity loss and extinction of species is supported by many discussions and interviews with leading authors and scientists working for the Convention of Biodiversity and IUCN as well as publications regarding current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment the IUCN Red List and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook Most organizations that associate their work with species and ecosystembiodiversity concerns as well as the scientific community as a whole believe that the six main threats to our oceans are climate change overfishing predator loss pollution destruction of habitat and bycatch “bykill” For instance The Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union and the Convention on Biological Diversity As of August 2012 the 2004 Global Species Assessment was the most recent empirical data on global extinction rates based on birds mammals and amphibians According to an interview conducted by Dr Oppenlander with Simon Stuart PhD chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission “Habitat loss from grazing livestock and feed crops is far and away the most pervasive threat to terrestrial animal species impacting 86 percent of all mammals 88 percent of amphibians and 86 percent of all birds One in every eight birds one in every three amphibians and one in every four mammals is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the near future Overexploitation of wild animals for consumption remains a second major factor for extinction such as can be seen in bushmeat trade in Africa and Southeast Asia and all hunting endeavors on land globally” The Alliance for Global Conservation estimates 36 percent of all species on our planet are in danger of extinction Scientists have divided our planet into 825 terrestrial “ecoregions” as well as 450 freshwater and a number of oceanic ecoregions each defined by its own distinct set of animal and plant species as well as climate Of all these land ecoregions almost half are reported by lead scientists interviewsdiscussions to have livestock as a current threat The World Conservation Union reported in 2010 that “most of the world’s endangered or threatened species” on their Red List which lists the species that are most endangered are suffering habitat loss due to livestock—not due to agriculture but to livestock The Convention on Biological Diversity held in Nagoya Japan in October 2010 agreed that none of their goals from 2002 for lessening the rate of biodiversity loss were met The attendees confirmed that the main pressures for the rapid loss of species—habitat change overexploitation pollution invasive species and climate change—were all increasing in intensity Current biodiversity assessments as presented by Millennium Ecosystem Assessment the IUCN Red List and the Global Environmental and Biodiversity Outlook now generally agree that land use change modification of river flow freshwater pollution and exploitation of marine environments are the most significant drivers of biodiversity change and loss of species Because more than 50 of the land use changes on Earth are related to livestock ILRI 70 to 90 of freshwater pollution in western countries particularly the US and China can be traced back to animal agriculture minimally 145 of anthropogenic GHG emissionsclimate change and 100 of “exploitation of marine environments” is related to the global commercial fishing industry it can be safely and confidently demonstrated that “the primary driver of global species’ extinctions and loss of biodiversity is animal agriculture” xx The amount of water land and fuel used for differing diets varies greatly from the types of foods consumed amount consumed and the geographical region where the food was raised Taking into consideration that 1lb of beef requires upwards of 2500 gallons of water to produce compared to only 25 gallons for 1lb of wheat the water footprint of a person consuming a high meat diet could be 100x greater than that of a person consuming only plant foods The same applies for land and oil use Many arid areas of the world can not support 1 cow per 2 acres and require 50 acre per cow compared to a crops such as potatoes that can produce 50000lbs per acre The energyfuel inputs are similar 1 calorie of beef can take 27x more energy to produce than soybeans xxi New As of 2016 the estimates of wild horses and burros has increased on the range to 67027 and the amount of wild horses and burros in holding fcailities is more than 45000 However the BLM considers the amount of wild horses and burros on the range too populated and will attempt to remove 40000 to bring the level back to what is considered by the BLM the acceptable level Subscribe to our Newsletter Sign up with your email address to receive news and updates from AUM

Jonathan Foley No Vertical Farms Won’t Feed the World While they are wellintentioned new indoor “farms” won’t help feed the world or reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture We would be better to focus our efforts elsewhere Dr Jonathan Foley Follow Aug 1 2018 · 6 min read W e’re beginning to see a new fad in agriculture — socalled “vertical farms” that grow food indoors with energyintensive artificial life support systems In the last few years a number of tech companies have designed “farms” that utilize artificial lights heaters water pumps and computer controls to grow crops inside These systems glow with a fantastic magenta light — from LEDs that are specially tuned to provide optimal light for photosynthesis — often with stacked trays of plants one on top of the other Some of this technology is new especially the LEDs although pot growers have used tools like this for years Some of the more notable efforts to build indoor “farms” include Freight Farms in Boston And there is a group at MIT that is trying to create new hightech platforms for growing food inside including “ food computers ” These folks are very smart and have done a lot to perfect the technology At first blush these “farms” sound great Why not completely eliminate food miles and grow food right next to restaurants cafeterias or supermarkets And why not grow crops inside closed systems where water can be recycled and pests can in theory be managed without chemicals It sounds great doesn’t it But there are many challenges F irst Vertical Farms Cost a Fortune But there are costs to these farms Huge costs First these systems are really expensive to build The shipping container systems developed by Freight Farms for example cost between 82000 and 85000 per container — an astonishing sum for a box that just grows greens and herbs Just one container costs as much as 10 entire acres of prime American farmland — which is a far better investment both in terms of food production and future economic value Just remember farmland has the benefit of generally appreciating in value over time whereas a big metal box is likely to only decrease in value Second food produced this way is very expensive For example the Wall Street Journal reports that minilettuces grown by Green Line Growers costs more than twice as much as organic lettuce available in most stores And this is typical for other indoor growers around the country it’s very very expensive even compared to organic food Instead of making food more available especially to poorer families on limited budgets these indoor crops are only available to the affluent It might be fine for gourmet lettuce or fancy greens for expensive restaurants but regular folks may find it out of reach Finally indoor farms use a lot of energy and materials to operate The container farms from Freight Farms for example use about 80 kilowatthours of electricity a day to power the lights and pumps That’s nearly 2–3 times as much electricity as a typical and still very inefficient American home or about 8 times the electricity used by an average San Francisco apartment And on the average American electrical grid this translates to emitting 44000 pounds of CO2 per container per year from electricity alone not counting any additional heating costs This is vastly more than the emissions it would take to ship the food from someplace else And none of it is necessary B ut Wait Can’t Indoor Farms Use Renewable Energy Proponents of indoor technofarms often say that they can offset the enormous sums of electricity they use by powering them with renewable energy — especially solar panels — to make the whole thing carbon neutral But just stop and think about this for a second These indoor “farms” would use solar panels to harvest naturally occurring sunlight and convert it into electricity so that they can power… artificial sunlight In other words they’re trying to use the sun to replace the sun But we don’t need to replace the sun Of all of the things we should worry about in agriculture the availability of free sunlight is not one of them Any system that seeks to replace the sun to grow food is probably a bad idea B esides “Food Miles” Aren’t a Big Climate Problem Sometimes we hear that vertical farms help the environment by reducing “food miles” — the distance food items travel from farm to table — and thereby reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions This sounds logical but it turns out to be a red herring Strange as it might seem local food typically uses about the same amount of energy — per pound — to transport as food grown far away Why Short answer volume and method of transport A larger food operator can ship food more efficiently — even if it travels longer distances — because of the gigantic volumes they work in Plus ships trains and even large trucks driving on Interstate highways use less fuel per pound per mile than small trucks driving around town Plus it turns out that “food miles” aren’t a very big source of CO2 emissions anyway whether they’re local or not In fact they pale in comparison to emissions from deforestation methane from cattle and rice fields and nitrous oxide from overfertilized fields And local food systems — especially organic farms that use fewer fertilizers and grass fed beef that sequesters carbon in the soil — can reduce these more critical emissions At the end of the day local food systems are generally better for the environment including greenhouse gas emissions Just don’t worry about emissions from food miles too much A nd These Vertical “Farms” Can’t Grow Much A further problem with indoor farms is that a lot of crops could never develop properly in these artificial conditions While LED lights provide the light needed for photosynthesis to occur they don’t provide the proper mix of light and heat to trigger plant development stages — like those that tell plants when to put on fruit or seed Moreover a lot of crops need a bit of wind to develop tall strong stalks needed later when they are carrying heavy loads before harvest As a result indoor farms are severely limited and have a hard time growing things besides simple greens Indoor farms might be able to provide some garnish and salads to the world but forget about them as a means of growing much other food A Better Way I’m not the only critic of indoor hightech energyintensive agriculture Other authors are starting to point out the problems with these systems too read very good critiques here here here and here While I appreciate the enthusiasm and innovation put into developing indoor farms I think these efforts are at the end of the day counterproductive Instead I think we should use the same investment of dollars incredible technology and amazing brains to solve other agricultural problems — like developing new methods for drip irrigation better grazing systems that lock up soil carbon and ways of recycling onfarm nutrients Organic farming and highprecision agriculture are doing promising things and need more help We also need innovation and capital to help other parts of the food system especially in tackling food waste and getting people to shift their diets towards more sustainable directions An interconnected network of good farms —real farms that provide nutritious food with social and environmental benefits to their communities — is the kind of innovation we really need NOTE parts of this piece were adapted from an earlier blog article of mine called “Local Food is Great But Can It Go Too Far” Dr Jonathan Foley

Angelesarea hospitals to declare an internal disaster By Cheri Mossburg and Madeline Holcombe CNN Updated 410 PM ET Tue December 29 2020 JUST WATCHED Its a disaster Inside a California hospital running out of beds Replay More Videos MUST WATCH Its a disaster Inside a California hospital running out of beds 0336 CNN Oxygen supply issues led at least five Los Angeles County hospitals to declare an internal disaster Sunday which included turning patients away There are multiple issues involving oxygen delivery to patients but generally the problem is not an absolute shortage of oxygen according to Dr Christina Ghaly Los Angeles County Health Services director Instead at some area hospitals aging infrastructure that pumps oxygen to patient rooms is unable to keep up with the high number of patients needing oxygen Theyre not able to maintain the pressure in the pipe to maintain oxygen delivery at that high level of pressure thats required to be delivered through the highflow oxygen delivery vehicles Ghaly said Because of that high flow through the pipes sometimes its freezing in the pipes and obviously if it freezes then you cant have good flow of oxygen The oxygen issues come as Los Angeles County sees a nearoverwhelming surge of Covid19 patients taking nearly every hospital to capacity Nearly 7000 patients are currently hospitalized with about 20 of those in intensive care units Read More California has seen a startling increase in coronavirus infections hospitalizations and deaths over the past two months The state averaged more than 40000 new coronavirus infections every day for the week prior to Christmas according to data from Johns Hopkins University filling up hospitals and pushing health care workers to consider ways to ration care Shortage of oxygen canisters too A patient lies on a stretcher in the hallway of the overloaded emergency room at Providence St Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley California on December 23 2020 To solve the oxygen supply issue some hospitals are moving Covid19 patients down to lower floors within the medical center which makes it easier to pump the oxygen through pipes without it freezing Another challenge Ghaly said is that several supply companies have a shortage of the actual oxygen canisters that patients can take home once discharged from the hospital Without the canisters patients who might otherwise be able to go home and free up a bed and health care workers time have to stay in the hospital Los Angeles County Department of Health Services confirmed that several hospitals have gone on internal disaster designation because of oxygen issues closing themselves off to incoming EMS traffic The hospitals most impacted are in the eastern areas of LA County and the San Fernando Valley the department said One aspect of the issue was just the sheer amount of oxygen needed to treat severe Covid19 which primarily affects the lungs First high levels of oxygen are necessary to treat patients with COVID19 and that level may be up to 10 times more than normal usage the deparmtent said in a statement Hospitals in general are running out of oxygen sooner than under their normal conditions and the oxygen suppliers are changing their processes to respond to the hospitals needs Other hospitals are seeing shortages of space and staff Record Covid19 hospitalizations in US could soon force health experts to ration care At Martin Luther King Jr Community Hospital in Los Angeles for example patients are being treated in tents outside the hospital in a conference room and in the chapel Gurneys are taken into the gift shop Rationing care could be next hospital CEO Dr Elaine Batchlor said Monday If we continue to see an increase in the number of Covid patients we may be forced to do something that as health professionals we all really just loathe having to even think about she said At Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena California nurses that usually care for one or two patients are now caring for three or four infectious disease specialist Dr Kimberly Shriner told CNN on Sunday We have a limited number of ventilators we have a limited number of ICU beds Shriner said adding that a team including a bioethicist a community member a physician a nurse and an administrative leader will decide how to divide those resources if it comes down to it These issues can combine for some difficult decisions ahead said CNN medical analyst Dr Jonathan Reiner If you dont have respirators you dont have nurses to care for patients you dont have ICU beds we will have to have these terrible discussions with families which is why people need to stay home and when they go out they need to wear a mask Reiner said CNNs Eric Levenson contributed to this report

Purchase Very good for me I use it mainly for listening to ATC I live in north London and have it hooked up to an external Swedishmade professional airband rxtx antenna and have no problems receiving LHR LGW STN airports including ground traffic Being able to add tags to the frequencies is so useful but is a bit of a palaver doing it on the scanner much better to use programming software on your pc the scanner has the older USB mini type B socket for connection using an appropriate cable Theres not much of a choice of software to do this and youll probably come across BuTel software which is fine if a little expensive around €30 last time I looked Whatever you do do NOT try and get the software for free by using TrialPay ITS A SCAM I know as I got caught Apart from airband Ive only taken the scanner out to my local shopping centre to try the Close Call feature to identify local transmissions It worked well and in addition to pickingup security etc it also picked up the local buses The scanner is solidly built and has so many customisable options that it will take you a while to learn what it can do Uniden provide a 70 pages printed manual in English which is nice not to say unusual these days but if you prefer you can also download it as a PDF The antenna connector is a BNC and there are many third party antennae available for it Sound quality is good and clear for my purposes and having just tried it at max is more than adequate but distorts a little but I guess thats to be expected with a small speaker I had a Uniden Bearcat UBC 100XL in the 1980s for airband reception and loved it I worked at an airport then and occasionally took it into work with me especially when on nightshifts so that when I was out on the apron I could track my inbounds It was brilliant which is why I chose Uniden again Im not sure the batter life on this is that great it comes with a set of 2300mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries which are charged via the USB socket but theres no autosensor circuitry to stop when the batteries are charged Instead you have to set a charging time via the options which is a bit crp in my opinion As I use the scanner at home I simply removed the batteries and have it connected via the USB cable to my pc which works well Squelch is via the menu system theres no knob and the single knob on top is multifunction Turn it and it changes channelfrequency push it down first and it controls the volume It functions differently depending on the mode you are in and it clicks as it turns which is nice although to be honest the click feels a little lightweight plasticky…or cheap The rubber buttons however have a nice action to them and a positive click when pressed You can have a beep too when they are pressed and this can be turned off in the options Anyway this wasnt meant to be an indepth review as I havent used it that much but sometimes when I start typing I cant stop But for my purposes it fits the bill very well indeed I hope this has been of some use to someone Read more 50 out of 5 stars Good Very good By 55bb on 26 February 2017 Very good for me I use it mainly for listening to ATC I live in north London and have it hooked up to an

many third party antennae available for it Sound quality is good and clear for my purposes and having just tried it at max is more than adequate but distorts a little but I guess thats to be expected with a small speaker I had a Uniden Bearcat UBC 100XL in the 1980s for airband reception and loved it I worked at an airport then and occasionally took it into work with me especially when on nightshifts so that when I was out on the apron I could track my inbounds It was brilliant which is why I chose Uniden again Im not sure the batter life on this is that great it comes with a set of 2300mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries which are charged via the USB socket but theres no autosensor circuitry to stop when the batteries are charged Instead you have to set a charging time via the options which is a bit crp in my opinion As I use the scanner at home I simply removed the batteries and have it connected via the USB cable to my pc which works well Squelch is via the menu system theres no knob and the single knob on top is multifunction Turn it and it changes channelfrequency push it down first and it controls the volume It functions differently depending on the mode you are in and it clicks as it turns which is nice although to be honest the click feels a little lightweight plasticky…or cheap The rubber buttons however have a nice action to them and a positive click when pressed You can have a beep too when they are pressed and this can be turned off in the options Anyway this wasnt meant to be an indepth review as I havent used it that much but sometimes when I start typing I cant stop But for my purposes it fits the bill very well indeed I hope this has been of some use to someone Images in this review 193 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse Jetage HALL OF FAME TOP 50 REVIEWER 50 out of 5 stars If you are just getting into scanning this is all you need for civil and military and the ISS Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2018 Style Name Scanner Verified Purchase I had been wanting to get into scanning for a long time and after lots of forum deep dives the 125XLT seems to be THE choice to get into the hobby Im really glad I splashed out and didnt go for anything else It has inbuilt banks to search through for civil aviation CB radio Marine etc but a simple google search will allow you to pick out some local frequencies for your areas that you want to hear Programming these in see below lets you go into scan mode just looking through a set number of frequencies of your choice After 5 minutes of listening to your local cab company youll soon want to drop it The banks are really useful when scanning It allows you to set things up into logical groups to include or exclude areas or choices I have mine setup 1 Local airport frequencies 2 ISS yes you can listen to the Space Station as it goes over 3 Air shows red arrows BBMF etc and others for airports High altitude routes and military frequencies used alot locally You can temporarily lock out a frequency get the unit to ignore it at the press of a button until you next power up Battery life is great with power supplied by 2x rechargeable AAs so easy to carry a few spares if you need them However thisll go all day for me at an air show or just listening in to the local airport To get started Id recommend downloading a copy of the excellent and independently written Scan 125 program This will allow you to manually enter all of your frequencies into relevant banks on mass via PC connected over USB cable This will also allow you to name your channels something pretty impossible directly on the handset Reception for me is great with the included aerial but there are simple low price upgrades available Perfect performance from our loft conversion around 4 miles from Bournemouth airport and the same in the garden too The 125 comes with a headphone jack so if you are out and about and want to be a little more discrete about what is lets be honest quite a geeky hobby you can plug in your badass Beats cans and enjoy great audio quality If you are thinking about dabbling I cant recommend this enough Listening to the red arrows for the first time is both amusing and a great insight into how physical and intricate their performances are Read more 92 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse STP 50 out of 5 stars Liked it so much I bought a 2nd Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2018 Style Name Scanner Verified Purchase I’ve owned many scanners down the years Most considered to be high end After a gap I decided to reenter the hobby and after some research bought the 125xlt That was 2 years ago That radio is still in regular use Recently I decided to bag another while they were still available Although it’s an insurance against damage No2 has already been programmed for a different range of services Manual programming is straightforward but time consuming but I use Scan 125 which is a handy piece of freeware donations welcome by the developer At these sort of prices it’s cheap well built and a great scanner for the air marine enthusiast Read more 48 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse

FACLM August 5th 2016 Volume 32 HOW NOT TO DIE The Role of Diet in Preventing Arresting Reversing Our Top 15 Killers 443 8863 387 votes In this “bestof” compilation of his last four yearinreview presentations Dr Greger explains what we can do about the 1 cause of death and disability our diet Subscribe to Videos Discuss Republish Transcript Allow me to begin on a personal note This is a picture of me right around the time that my grandma was diagnosed with endstage heart disease and sent home to die She had already had so many bypass operations basically ran out of plumbing at some point confined to a wheelchair and there was nothing more they could do Her life was over at age 65 But then she heard about this guy Nathan Pritikin one of our early lifestyle medicine pioneers And what happened next is chronicled in Pritikin’s biography My grandma was one of the “death’s door” people Frances Greger arrived in a wheelchair “Mrs Greger had heart disease angina and claudication her condition was so bad she could no longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs Within three weeks though she was not only out of her wheelchair but was walking ten miles a day” This is my grandma at her grandson’s wedding 15 years after she was given her medical death sentence and thanks to a healthy diet she was able to live another 31 years on this earth—until 96—to enjoy her six grandkids including me That is why I went into medicine When Dr Ornish published his Lifestyle Heart Trial years later proving with quantitative angiography that coronary artery disease could indeed be reversed in the majority of patients without drugs or surgery—just a plantbased diet and other healthy lifestyle changes I assumed that it was going to be a gamechanger My family had seen it with their own eyes but finally here it was in black and white published in one of the world’s most prestigious medical journals on the planet But nothing happened— leaving me to wonder if effectively the cure to our 1 killer could get lost down some rabbit hole and ignored then what else might be in the medical literature that can help my patients I made it my life’s mission to find out For those of you unfamiliar with my work every year I read through every issue of every Englishlanguage nutrition journal in the world—so busy folks like you don’t have to I then compile all the most interesting the most groundbreaking the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day to my nonprofit site NutritionFactsorg Everything on the website is free There are no ads no corporate sponsorships It’s strictly noncommercial not selling anything I just put it up as a public service as a labor of love New videos and articles every day on the latest in evidencebased nutrition What a concept Where did Pritikin get his evidence from A network of missionary hospitals set up by Western doctors throughout subSaharan Africa uncovered what may be one of the most important advances in health according to one of our most famous medical figures of the 20th century Dr Denis Burkitt the fact that many of the most common and major diseases “in modern Western culture are universally rare in third world communities” Like heart disease This landmark article from the 50s started out with a shocking statement “In the African population of Uganda coronary heart disease is almost nonexistent” Wait a second our 1 cause of death almost nonexistent What were they eating They were eating a lot of starchy vegetables starchy grains and greens and their protein almost exclusively from plant sources and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it Actually very similar to those eating modernday plantbased diets Maybe the Africans were just dying early from some other kind of diseases—and so never lived long enough to have a heart attack No here are agematched heart attack rates in Uganda versus St Louis Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda only one myocardial infarction Out of 632 age and gendermatched autopsies in Missouri 136 myocardial infarctions more than 100 times the rate of our 1 killer In fact they were so blown away they went back and did another 800 autopsies in Uganda and still just that one small healed infarct meaning it wasn’t even the cause of death out of 1427 patients—less than one in a thousand whereas here heart disease is an epidemic This is a list of diseases commonly found in the US and in populations that eat and live like the US but are rare or even nonexistent in populations centering their diets around whole plant foods These are among our most common diseases like obesity for example or hiatal hernia one of the most common stomach problems Varicose veins and hemorrhoids—two of the most common venous problems colorectal cancer—a leading cause of cancerrelated death diverticulitis—the 1 disease of the intestines appendicitis—the 1 cause of emergency abdominal surgery gallbladder disease—the 1 cause of nonemergency abdominal surgery as well as ischemic heart disease—the commonest cause of death here but a rarity among plantbased populations This suggests heart disease may be a choice Like cavities If you look at the teeth of people who lived over 10000 years before the invention of the toothbrush they pretty much had no cavities Didn’t brush a day in their lives no flossing yet no cavities That’s because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet Why do people continue to get cavities when we know they’re preventable through diet Simple Because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist’s chair for many people And that’s fine Look as long as people understand the consequences of their actions as a physician what more can I do If you’re an adult and decide the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family then go for it—I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence I’ve got a good dental plan But what if instead of the plaque on our teeth we’re talking about the plaque building up inside of our arteries This is another disease that can be prevented by changing our diet Now what are the consequences for you and your family Now we’re not talking about scraping tartar anymore Now we’re talking life and death The most likely reason that most of our loved ones will die is because of heart disease It’s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live—but we should make these choices consciously educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions Coronary heart disease atherosclerosis hardening of the arteries begins in childhood By age 10 the arteries of nearly all kids raised on the standard American diet already have fatty streaks—the first stage of the disease Then these plaques start forming in our 20s get worse in our 30s and then can start killing us off In our hearts it’s called a heart attack in our brains the same disease is called a stroke If there is anyone in this audience older than age 10 then the question isn’t whether or not to eat healthy to prevent heart disease it’s whether you want to reverse the heart disease that you already have Is that even possible When researchers took people with heart disease and put them on the kind of plantbased diet followed by those populations that didn’t suffer from heart disease their hope was to slow the disease process down—maybe even stop it But instead something miraculous happened The disease started to reverse to get better As soon as patients stopped eating an arteryclogging diet their arteries started opening up Their bodies were able to start dissolving some of the plaque away Even in some cases of severe triple vessel heart disease arteries opened up without drugs without surgery—suggesting their bodies wanted to heal all along but were just never given the chance This improvement in blood flow to the heart is after just three weeks of eating healthy Let me share with you the bestkept secret in medicine The bestkept secret in medicine is that sometimes given the right conditions our body can heal itself If you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table it can get all red hot swollen and inflamed but will heal naturally if we just stand back and let our body work its magic But what if we kept whacking it in the same place three times a day breakfast lunch and dinner every day It’d never heal You’d go to your doctor and say “My shin hurts” And the doctor would be like no problem whip out their pad and write you a prescription for painkillers You’re still whacking your shin three times a day but it feels so much better with the pain pills on board Thank heavens for modern medicine It’s like when taking nitroglycerine for crushing chest pain Tremendous relief but you’re not actually treating the underlying cause of the disease Our body wants to come back to health if we let it But if we keep reinjuring it three times a day we may never heal It’s like smoking One of the most amazing things I learned in medical school was that within about 15 years of stopping smoking our lung cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker Isn’t that amazing Our lungs can clear out all that tar and eventually it’s almost as if we never started smoking at all Every morning of our smoking life that healing process started until wham our first cigarette of the day reinjuring our lungs with every puff Just like we can reinjure our arteries with every bite when all we had to do all along—the miracle cure was to just stand back get out of the way stop redamaging ourselves and let our bodies’ natural healing processes bring us back towards health Sure you could choose moderation and hit yourself with a smaller hammer But why beat yourself up at all The human body is a selfhealing machine We’ve known about this for decades American Heart Journal 1977 cases like Mr FW here such severe angina he couldn’t even make it to the mailbox but then started eating healthier and a few months later he was climbing mountains no pain There are some fancy new antiangina drugs on the market now that cost thousands of dollars a year But at the highest dose they can successfully prolong exercise duration extending the time someone can walk on a treadmill as long as 33 12 seconds It does not look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon You see plantbased diets aren’t just safer and cheaper but they can work better Killer 2 is cancer What happens if we put cancer on a plantbased diet Dean Ornish and colleagues found that the progression of prostate cancer could be reversed with a plantbased diet and other healthy lifestyle behaviors—and no wonder If you drip the blood of those eating the standard American diet onto cancer cells growing in a petri dish cancer growth is cut down by about 9 But put people on a plantbased diet for a year though and their blood can do this The blood circulating within the bodies of those eating plantbased diets has nearly eight times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth Now this was for prostate cancer—the leading cancer killer specific to men In women it’s breast cancer So researchers tried duplicating the study with women using breast cancer cells instead They didn’t want to wait a whole year to get the results though So they figured they’d see what a healthy diet could do in just two weeks against three different types of human breast cancer cells This was the before cancer growth powering away at 100 And then after eating a plantbased diet for 14 days Here’s the before picture a layer of breast cancer cells is laid down in a petri dish and then blood from women eating the standard American diet is dripped on them And as you can see even people eating crappy diets have some ability to break down cancer But after just two weeks eating healthy blood was drawn from those same women—so they acted as their own controls—dripped on another carpet of breast cancer cells and this is what they were left with just a few individual cancer cells left Their bodies just cleaned up Before and after just two weeks eating healthy Their blood became that much more hostile to cancer Slowing down the growth of cancer cells is nice but getting rid of them is even better This is what’s called apoptosis programmed cell death After eating healthy their own bodies were able to reprogram the cancer cells forcing them into early retirement This is what’s called TUNEL imaging measuring DNA fragmentation or cell death Dying cells show up as white spots So again this is the before—what the blood of the average woman eating a standard American diet can do to breast cancer cells Her blood may be able to kill off a few But then after 14 days of healthy plantbased living her blood can do this It’s like she’s an entirely different person inside The same blood that was now coursing through these women’s bodies gained the power to significantly slow down and stop breast cancer cell growth within just two weeks of eating a plantbased diet What kind of blood do we want in our body what kind of immune system Do we want blood that just kind of rolls over when new cancer cells pop up or do we want blood circulating to every nook and cranny of our body with the power to slow down and stop them Now this dramatic strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plantbased diet and exercise they had these women out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day Well wait a second if you do two things how do you know what role the diet played So the researchers decided to put it to the test This is measuring cancer cell clearance This is what we saw before the effect of blood taken from those who ate a plantbased diet—in this case for an average of 14 years—along with mild exercise like just walking every day Plantbased diet and walking—that’s the kind of cancer cell clearance you get Compare that to the cancerstopping power of your average sedentary meateater which is basically nonexistent This middle group is interesting though Instead of 14 years on a plantbased diet ate 14 years of a standard American diet— but had 14 years of daily strenuous hourlong exercise like calisthenics The researchers wanted to know if you exercise long enough if you exercise hard enough can you rival some strolling planteaters And the answer is exercise helped—no question but literally 5000 hours in the gym was no match for a plantbased diet Same thing as before Even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes your body’s not totally defenseless Your bloodstream can kill off a few cancer cells But here’s the hard core strenuous exercise group killing off cancer cells left and right But nothing appears to kick more cancer tush than a plantbased diet We think it’s because of the animal proteins—meat egg white and dairy proteins—increasing the level of IGF1 in our bodies Insulinlike growth factor1 a cancerpromoting growth hormone involved in the acquisition and progression of malignant tumors But if we lower animal protein intake if you put people on a plantbased diet their IGF1 levels go down and if you put people on a plantbased diet for years their levels drop even further And their IGF1 binding protein levels go up That’s one way our body tries to protect itself from cancer—from excessive growth—by releasing a binding protein into our bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF1 It’s like our body’s emergency brake Yes in as little as two weeks a plantbased diet can bring down your liver’s production of IGF1 But what about all the IGF1 circulating in your bloodstream from the bacon and eggs you had three weeks before So your liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to take it out of circulation And as you can see it just gets better and better the longer you eat healthy Here’s the experiment that nailed IGF1 as the villain same as last time Go on a plantbased diet cancer cell growth drops and cancer cell death shoots up But then here’s the kicker what if you added back to the cancer the exact same amount of IGF1 banished from your system just because you were eating healthy for two weeks It erases the diet and exercise effect It’s like you never started eating healthy at all So the reason the largest prospective study on diet and cancer ever found that the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meateaters may be because they eat less animal protein So they end up with less IGF1 which can mean less cancer growth How much less cancer are we talking about Middleaged men and women with high protein intakes had a 75 increase in total mortality and a four – fold increase in the risk of dying from cancer But not all proteins specifically animal protein which makes sense of course given the higher IGF1 levels The academic institution sent out a press release with a memorable opening line “That chicken wing you’re eating could be as deadly as a cigarette” explaining that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer—”a mortality risk factor comparable to smoking” What was the response to the revelation that diets high in meat eggs and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking One nutrition scientist replied that it was potentially dangerous to compare the effects of smoking with the effect of meat and cheese Why Because a smoker might think “Why bother quitting smoking if my ham and cheese sandwich is just as bad for me” So better not to tell anyone about the whole meat and dairy thing That reminds me of a famous Philip Morris cigarette ad that tried to downplay the risks by saying “You think secondhand smoke is bad increasing the risk of lung cancer 19 Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of milk every day may be three times as bad—62 increased risk of lung cancer” Or doubling the risk by frequently cooking with oil or tripling your risk of heart disease by eating nonvegetarian or multiplying your risk sixfold by eating lots of meat and dairy So they conclude “Let’s keep a sense of perspective here” The risk of lung cancer from secondhand smoke may be “well below the risk reported for other everyday activities” So breathe deep That’s like saying “Don’t worry about getting stabbed because getting shot is so much worse” Uh how about neither Two risks don’t make a right You’ll note Philip Morris stopped throwing dairy under the bus when they purchased Kraft Foods Okay what about the other 13 leading causes of death The top three killers used to be heart disease cancer and stroke Oh that is so 2007 Now it’s heart disease cancer and COPD—chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases like emphysema Thankfully COPD can be prevented with the help of a plantbased diet and even treated with plants improving lung function over time Of course the tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently Instead of adding plants to one’s diet to help one’s lung function wouldn’t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes And indeed the addition of açaí berries to cigarettes evidently has a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice Who would have thunk it Next they’re going to be putting berries in meat And indeed I couldn’t make this stuff up The addition of fruit extracts to burgers was not without its glitches though The blackberries “literally dyed burger patties with a distinct purplish colour”—though evidently infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in does evidently improve tenderness And it’s even possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurters with powdered grape seeds though there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product And if there’s one thing we know about hot dogeaters it’s that they’re picky about what goes in their food Pig anus Okay but grape seeds Eww Strokes are killer 4 Preventing strokes may be all about eating potassiumrich foods yet most Americans don’t even reach the recommended minimum daily intake And by most I mean more than 98 98 of us eat potassiumdeficient diets because 98 of us don’t eat enough plants Potassium comes from the words pot ash You take any plant put it in a pot and reduce it to ash and you’re left with potashium socalled vegetable alkali True story but can anyone name me a plant food particularly high in potassium Bananas right I don’t know why that’s like the one thing everyone knows about nutrition Chiquita must have had a great PR firm or something But it turns out that bananas don’t even make the top 50 sources coming in at number 86 right behind fast food vanilla milk shakes It goes fast food vanilla milk shakes then bananas In fact when I was researching for my new book I found out that the USDA expanded their list and now bananas don’t even make the top thousand sources coming in at number 1611 right after Reese’s Pieces I kid you not The most concentrated whole food sources of potassium in the diet are beans and greens and dates Bananas don’t make it to a thousand—in fact if you look at the next leading cause of death unintentional injuries bananas could be downright dangerous Alzheimer’s disease is now our sixth leading killer now striking a staggering four million Americans affected Twenty years ago it wasn’t even in the top ten According to the latest dietary guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer’s the two most important things we can do cut down our consumption of meat dairy and junk and replace those with vegetables beans fruits and whole grains This is based in part on data going back over 20 years now Those who eat meat—red meat or white meat it doesn’t matter—appear between two to three times more likely to become demented later in life compared to those that don’t eat meat And the longer one eats meatfree the lower the risk of dementia drops Next on the list type 2 diabetes which we can prevent arrest and reverse with a plantbased diet—something we’ve known since back in the 1930s Within five years about a quarter of the diabetics were able to get off insulin But plantbased diets are lowcalorie diets Maybe their diabetes just got better because they lost so much weight To tease that out what we would need is a study where researchers switch people to a healthy diet but force them to eat so much food that they wouldn’t lose any weight despite eating healthier Then we could see if plantbased diet had unique benefits beyond all the weight loss We’d have to wait 44 years but here it is subjects were weighed every day and if they started losing weight they were made to eat more food In fact so much food some of the participants had problems eating it all—like “not another tostada not another salad” But they eventually adapted so there was no significant alteration in body weight despite restricting meat dairy eggs and junk So with zero weight loss did a plantbased diet still help Overall insulin requirements were cut about 60 and half were able to get off insulin altogether despite no change in weight How many years did this take No 16 days So we’re talking diabetics who’ve had diabetes for as long as 20 years injecting 20 units of insulin a day And then as few as 13 days later they’re off of all insulin altogether thanks to less than two weeks on a plantbased diet—even with zero weight loss Diabetes for 20 years then off all insulin in two weeks Diabetes for 20 years because no one had told them about a plantbased diet Here’s patient 15 32 units of insulin on the control diet and then 18 days later on none Lower blood sugars on 32 units less insulin That’s the power of plants This was without weight loss his body just started working that much better And as a bonus their cholesterol dropped like a rock to under 150 in just 16 days Just like moderate changes in diet usually result in only modest reductions in cholesterol how moderate do you want your diabetes Everything in moderation may be a truer statement than many people realize Moderate changes in diet can leave diabetics with moderate vision loss moderate kidney failure and moderate amputations—maybe just a few toes or something Moderation in all things is not necessarily a good thing That study that purported to show that diets high in meat eggs and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking supposedly suggested that people who eat lots of animal protein are four times as likely to die from cancer or diabetes But if you look at the actual study you’ll see that’s not true Those eating lots of animal protein didn’t have just four times more risk of dying from diabetes they had 73 times higher risk of dying from diabetes Those who chose moderation—eating a moderate amount of animal protein—only had 23 times the risk of death from diabetes Killer 8 is kidney failure which may be both prevented and treated with a plantbased diet And no surprise kidneys are highly vascular organs Harvard researchers found three dietary risk factors for declining kidney function animal protein animal fat and cholesterol Animal fat can alter the actual structure of our kidneys based on studies like this showing plugs of fat literally clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys And the animal protein can have a profound effect on normal kidney function inducing what’s called hyperfiltration increasing the workload on the kidney but not plant protein Eat some tuna fish and you can see increased pressure on the kidneys one two and three hours after the meal shoots right up If instead of having a tuna salad sandwich though you had a tofu salad sandwich with the same amount of protein no effect Kidneys can deal with plant protein without even batting an eyelash Why does animal protein cause the overload reaction but not plant protein It appears to be due to inflammation triggered by the animal protein We know this because if you give a powerful antiinflammatory drug along with the tuna fish you can actually abolish that hyperfiltration effect that protein leakage effect in response to meat ingestion Then there’s the acid load Animal protein induces the formation of acid within the kidney which may lead to tubular toxicity damage to the delicate urinemaking tubes within the kidney Animal foods tend to be acidforming whereas plant foods tend to either be relatively neutral or actually alkaline base forming to counteract some of that acid So the solution to halting the progression of chronic kidney disease might lie in the produce aisle rather than the pharmacy aisle No wonder plantbased diets have been used to treat kidney disease for decades Here’s protein leakage on the lowsodium diet that physicians would conventionally put these patients on switched to a supplemented vegan diet conventional plantbased conventional plantbased—turning kidney dysfunction on and off like a light switch based on what’s going into their mouths Killer 9 is respiratory infections What possible role could diet play You obviously haven’t seen my video Kale and the Immune System talking about the immunostimulatory effects of kale Is there anything kale cannot do Boosting antibody production sevenfold but that’s in a petri dish What about in people Older men and women were split into two groups right before they were going to get their Pneumovax vaccination their pneumonia vaccination Half continued to eat as they always had The other half added just a few servings of fruits and vegetables to their daily diet and after getting their injection you can see a significant improvement in the protective antibody immune response from that one simple change That wasn’t cutting out meat just adding fruits and vegetables can significantly improve immune function Killer 10 is suicide We’ve known those eating healthier have healthier mood states—in fact only about half the depression anxiety and stress scores compared to those that eat meat Researchers suspect it’s the arachidonic acid this inflammatory long chain omega6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs That’s where it’s predominantly found in the American diet But you can’t tell if it’s cause and effect until you put it to the test They took people eating the standard American diet and removed meat fish poultry and eggs from their diets and got a significant improvement in mood scores within just two weeks Thanks perhaps to the removal of arachidonic acid from their bodies which they thought may be adversely impacting mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation brain inflammation but we could bring that down within a matter of weeks after cutting eggs chicken and other meat Now am I just cherry picking though What about all the randomized controlled trials like that showing that other diets have improved mood There aren’t any A recent review concluded that only the plantbased study fit the bill It’s hard to cherry pick when there’s only one cherry Works in a workplace setting too significant increases in physical functioning general health vitality and mental health—not surprisingly translating into improved work productivity The biggest such study across 15 corporate sites at Geico found that plantbased diets resulted in significant reported improvements in depression anxiety stress fatigue and emotional wellbeing So lifestyle interventions such as exercise can help mental as well as physical health And among the most effective of these is the use of plantbased diets Killer 11 is blood infections Sure foodborne bacteria can kind of burrow through the bloodstream and directly invade through the intestinal wall—but in women may creep up into their bladder We’ve known for decades that it’s bacteria creeping up from the rectum that cause bladder infections But only recently did we figure out where that rectal reservoir of bladderinfecting E coli was coming from chicken We now have DNA fingerprinting proof of a direct link between farm animals meat and bladder infections—solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis bladder infections as an animaltohuman disease Wait a second Can’t I just use a meat thermometer and cook the meat through No because of crosscontamination We’ve known for decades that if you give someone a frozen chicken to prepare and cook in their own kitchen as they normally would a multitude of antibioticresistant E coli jump from the chicken into the gut of the volunteer —before they even eat it So you could incinerate it to ash you don’t even have to eat any of it And it still wouldn’t matter because you already infected yourself just handling it Within days the drugresistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person’s gut flora The chicken bacteria were like taking over their intestines Even if you follow all the safe handling guidelines rinsing everything with bleach—even spraying bleach on for good measure there still may be pathogenic fecal bacteria left behind No one actually does this but what if you did this and then came in later and swabbed kitchen surfaces Researchers found pathogenic fecal bacteria salmonella campylobacter—both serious human pathogens still left behind in the kitchen The reason that most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen sink than on their toilet seat is because most people rinse chickens in the sink not the toilet So unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab the only way to guarantee we’re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into our homes in the first place The good news is that it’s not like you eat chicken once and you’re colonized for life In this study the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about ten days before our good bacteria were able to muscle them out of the way The problem is that most families eat chicken more than once every ten days so they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems But wait a second You can’t sell unsafe cars you can’t sell unsafe toys how is it legal to sell unsafe meat They do it by blaming the consumer As one USDA poultry microbiologist said “Raw meats are not idiotproof They can be mishandled and when they are it’s like handling a hand grenade If you pull the pin somebody’s going to get hurt” See if we get sick it’s our fault While some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in supermarkets the USDA poultry expert disagrees “I think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it” That’s like a car company saying yeah we installed faulty brakes but it’s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt The head of the CDC’s food poisoning division responded famously to this kind of blamethevictim attitude coming from the meat industry “Is it reasonable that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger their threeyearold dies” Is that reasonable Not to worry though the meat industry is on it They got the FDA approval for a bacteriaeating virus to spray on the meat Now the industry is concerned that consumer acceptance of bacteriaeating viruses may present something of a challenge to the food industry But if they think that’s going to be a challenge check out their other bright idea The “Effect of Extracted Housefly Pupae Peptide Mixture on Chilled Pork Preservation”—this is a sciencey way of saying they want to smear a maggot mixture on meat Now wait—it’s a lowcost and simple method Think about it maggots thrive on rotting meat However there have been no reports that maggots have any serious diseases so they must be packed with some sort of antibacterial something Have you ever seen a maggot sneeze I didn’t think so So they took maggots at three days old washed them toweled them off a little Vitamix action and voilà Safer meat We did kidney failure what about liver failure We’ve known for decades that a plantbased diet could be used to treat liver failure significantly reducing the toxins that would otherwise build up eating meat without a fully functional liver to detoxify your blood I do have to admit though that some people on plantbased diets have worsening liver function They’re called alcoholics Living on potatoes corn grapes and barley—in fact strictly plantbased yet still not doing so hot High blood pressure is next affecting nearly 78 million Americans That’s one in three of us And as we age our pressures get higher and higher such that by age 60 it strikes more than half Wait a second If it affects most of us when we get older maybe it’s less a disease and more just an inevitable consequence of aging No We’ve known since the 1920s that high blood pressure need not occur Researchers measured the blood pressures of a thousand people in rural Kenya who ate a diet centered around whole plant foods Starchy vegetables whole grains beans vegetables fruit and dark green leafies Our pressures go up as we age their pressures actually go down And the lower the better The whole 140 over 90 cutoff is arbitrary Even people who start out with blood pressure under 120 over 80 appear to benefit from blood pressure reduction So the ideal blood pressure the nobenefitfromreducingitfurther blood pressure is actually 110 over 70 But is it even possible to get blood pressures down to 110 over 70 It’s not just possible it’s normal—for those eating healthy enough diets Over two years at a rural Kenyan hospital 1800 patients were admitted How many cases of high blood pressure did they find Zero Wow So they must have had low rates of heart disease No they had no rates of heart disease Not a single case of arteriosclerosis our 1 killer was found Rural China too about 110 over 70 their entire lives 70yearolds had the same average blood pressure as 16yearolds Now of course Africa and China have vastly different diets but they share this common theme that they are plantbased daytoday with meat only eaten on special occasions Why do we think it’s the plantbased nature of their diets that was so protective Because in the Western world as the American Heart Association has pointed out the only folks really getting down that low are those eating strictly plantbased diets coming in at an average of 110 over 65 Based on the largest study of those eating plantbased diets to date—89000 Californians—there appears to be a stepwise drop in blood pressure rates as people eat more and more plantbased Same thing with diabetes and obesity The more and more healthy we eat the better Yes you can wipe out most of your risk eating strictly plantbased but it’s not black and white all or nothing Any movement along the spectrum towards healthier eating can accrue significant benefits You can show this experimentally You take vegetarians and give them meat pay them enough to eat it and their blood pressures go up Or you remove meat from their diet and their blood pressures go down—in just seven days And this is after the vast majority reduced or stopped their blood pressure medications completely They had to reduce their medications because their pressures were getting so low that if they were on drugs they could fall over and crack their heads open Lower pressures on fewer drugs that’s the power of plants So does the American Heart Association recommend a nomeat diet No they recommend a lowmeat diet the socalled DASH diet Why not vegetarian When the DASH diet was created were they just not aware of this landmark research done by Harvard’s Frank Sacks No they were aware of the landmark research The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Frank Sacks See the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the 1 goal of capturing the blood pressurelowering benefits of a vegetarian diet yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public They didn’t think the public could handle the truth In their defense you can see what they were thinking Just like drugs never work unless you actually take them diets never work unless you actually eat them So you can’t tell people to eat plantbased—they won’t do it So they figured they might help more on a population scale if they just softpedaled the truth to make it more acceptable Alright tell that to the thousand families a day that lose a loved one to high blood pressure Maybe it’s time to tell the American public the truth Killer 14 is Parkinson’s disease Does a plantbased diet reduce risk of Parkinson’s disease Well most studies to date do suggest a link between dairy products and Parkinson’s—but why Well there’s evidence that milk is contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals High levels of pesticide residues are found in the milk supply and in the brains of people who die from Parkinson’s disease And there are other pollutants like tetrahydroisoquiniline which is actually what scientists use to try to induce Parkinson’s in primates—and which is found mostly in cheese So maybe the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of the milk supply Good luck with that You could always just not drink it but then what would happen to your bones That’s a marketing ploy if you look at the actual science milk does not appear to protect against hip fracture risk whether drinking during your adult years or drinking milk during your teen years If anything milk consumption was associated with an increase in fracture risk Maybe this is why hip fracture rates are highest in populations with the greatest milk consumption where they drink the most milk Swedish researchers decided to put it to the test 100000 men and women followed for up to 20 years and milkdrinking women had higher rates of death more heart disease and significantly more cancer for each daily glass of milk Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of premature death And they had significantly more bone and hip fractures too More milk more fractures Milkdrinking men also had higher rates of death But for some reason you never see milk ads like this image of milk carton among gravestones Finally aspiration pneumonia which is caused by swallowing problems due to Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s or a stroke—all of which we’ve already covered So where does this leave us These are the top fifteen reasons that Americans die and a plantbased diet can help prevent nearly all of them can help treat more than half of them and even in some cases even reverse the progression of disease including our top three killers There are drugs that in some circumstances can help too You can take one drug to treat cholesterol every day for the rest of your life another drug for blood sugars a couple different pills for high blood pressure The same diet though does it all It’s not like there’s a liverhealthy diet and a hearthealthy diet and a different brainhealthy diet No a liverhealthy diet is a hearthealthy diet is a brainhealthy diet One diet to rule them all And what about drug side effects I’m not talking a little rash or something Prescription drugs kill more than 100000 Americans every year Wait a second—106000 deaths a year That means that the sixth leading cause of death is actually doctors The sixth leading cause of death… is me Thankfully I can be prevented with a plantbased diet Seriously though compared to 15000 American vegetarians meateaters had about twice the odds of being on aspirin sleeping pills tranquilizers antacids painkillers blood pressure medications laxatives of course and insulin So plantbased diets are great for those that don’t like taking drugs those that don’t like paying for drugs and for people that don’t like risking drug side effects Want to solve the healthcare crisis I’ve got a suggestion There is only one diet that’s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients—a plantbased diet Anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet ask them one simple question “Has it been proven to reverse heart disease You know the most likely reason you and everyone you love will die” If the answer is no why would you even consider it If that’s all a plantbased diet could do—reverse our 1 killer then shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven otherwise And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing treating and reversing other leading killers would seem to make the case for plantbased eating overwhelming Most deaths in the United States are preventable and related to nutrition According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published the 1 cause of death in the United States and the 1 cause of disability is our diet which has since bumped tobacco smoking to killer 2 Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year—whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more So let me end with a thought experiment Imagine yourself a smoker back in the 1950s The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4000 cigarettes a year Think about that In the 1950s the average American smoked a half a pack a day The media was telling you to smoke and famous athletes agreed Even Santa Claus I mean you want to keep fit and stay slender So you make sure to smoke and eat hot dogs to keep trim And eat lots of sugar to stay slim and trim Sugar is a lot better than that apple there right I mean sheesh Although apples do “connote goodness and freshness” reads one internal tobacco industry memo “which brings up many possibilities for making youthoriented cigarettes” They want to make appleflavored cigarettes for children Shameless “For digestion’s sake you smoke” I mean no curative power is claimed for Philip Morris—but an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure So better safe than sorry and smoke “Blow in her face and she’ll follow you anywhere” “No woman ever says no” They’re “so round so firm so fully packed” After all John Wayne smoked them until he got lung cancer and died Back then even the paleo folks were smoking and so were the doctors This is not to say there wasn’t controversy within the medical profession Yes some doctors smoked Camels but other doctors preferred Luckies So there was a little conflict there The leader of the US Senate agreed I mean who wouldn’t want to give their throat a vacation How could there be a single case of throat irritation when “cigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink” Perhaps in Flint Michigan And if you do get irritated No problem your doctor can always write you a prescription for cigarettes This is an ad in the Journal of the American Medical Association So when mainstream medicine is saying that smoking on balance is good for you when the American Medical Association is saying that where could you turn back then if you just wanted the facts What’s the new data advanced by science She was “too tired for fun…and then she smoked a Camel” Babe Ruth spoke of proof positive medical science—that is when he still could speak before he died of throat cancer Now if by some miracle there was a SmokingFactsorg website back then that could deliver the science directly bypassing commercially corruptible institutional filters you would have become aware of studies like this An Adventist study in California published in 1958 that showed that nonsmokers may have at least 90 lower lung cancer risk compared to smokers But this wasn’t the first When famed surgeon Michael DeBakey was asked why his studies published back in the 30s linking smoking and lung cancer were simply ignored he had to remind people about what it was like back then We were a smoking society It was in the movies it was everywhere Medical meetings were one heavy haze of smoke Smoking was in a word normal So back to our thought experiment if you’re a smoker in the 50s in the know what do you do Do you change or do you wait With access to the science you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your smoking habit is probably not good for you So do you change your smoking habits or do you wait If you wait until your physician tells you between puffs to quit you could have cancer by then If you wait until the powers that be officially recognize it like the Surgeon General did in the subsequent decade you could be dead by then It took 25 years for the Surgeon General’s report to come out It took more than 7000 studies and the deaths of countless smokers before the first Surgeon General’s report against smoking was finally released in the 1960s You’d think maybe after the first 6000 studies they could have given people a little heads up or something No it was a powerful industry So one wonders how many people are currently suffering needlessly from dietary diseases Maybe we should have stopped smoking after the 700th study like this came out As a smoker in the 50s on one hand you had all of society the government the medical profession itself telling you to smoke And on the other hand all you had was the science—if you were even lucky enough to be aware of studies like this Now fast forward 55 years There’s a new Adventist study out of California warning America about the risks of something else they may be putting in their mouths And it’s not just one study According to the latest review the total sum of evidence suggests that mortality from all causes put together and many of our dreaded diseases—heart disease stroke cancer diabetes—is significantly lower in those eating plantbased So instead of someone going along with America’s smoking habits in the 50s imagine you or someone you know going along with America’s eating habits today What do you do With access to the science you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your eating habits are probably not so good for you So do you change your eating habits or do you wait If you wait until your physician tells you between bites to change your diet it may be too late In fact even after the Surgeon General’s report was released the medical community still dragged their feet The AMA actually went on record refusing to endorse the Surgeon General’s report Why Could that have been because they had just been handed 10 million from the tobacco industry Maybe not maybe it’s coincidence So we know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry—but why weren’t individual doctors speaking out Well there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time writing in as there are today standing up against industries killing millions But why not more Maybe it’s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemic of dietary diseases What was the AMA’s rallying cry back then Everything in moderation “Extensive scientific studies have proved that smoking in moderation” is okay Sound familiar Today the food industry uses the same tobacco industry tactics—supplying misinformation twisting the science The same scientistsforhire paid to downplay the risks of secondhand smoke and toxic chemicals are the same paid by the National Confectioners Association to downplay the risks of candy and the same hired by the meat industry to downplay the risks of meat Consumption of animal products and processed foods causes at least 14 million deaths around the world every year 14 million people dead every year Plantbased diets can now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking How many more people have to die though before the CDC encourages people not to wait for openheart surgery to start eating healthy as well Until the system changes we need to take personal responsibility for our own health and for our family’s health We can’t wait until society catches up to the science because it’s a matter of life and death Last year Dr Kim Williams became President of the American College of Cardiology He was asked why he follows his own advice that he gives to patients to eat a plantbased diet “I don’t mind dying” Dr Williams replied “I just don’t want it to be my own fault” Thank you very much To see

picture of me right around the time that my grandma was diagnosed with endstage heart disease and sent home to die She had already had so many bypass operations basically ran out of plumbing at some point confined to a wheelchair and there was nothing more they could do Her life was over at age 65 But then she heard about this guy Nathan Pritikin one of our early lifestyle medicine pioneers And what happened next is chronicled in Pritikin’s biography My grandma was one of the “death’s door” people Frances Greger arrived in a wheelchair “Mrs Greger had heart disease angina and claudication her condition was so bad she could no longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs Within three weeks though she was not only out of her wheelchair but was walking ten miles a day” This is my grandma at her grandson’s wedding 15 years after she was given her medical death sentence and thanks to a healthy diet she was able to live another 31 years on this earth—until 96—to enjoy her six grandkids including me That is why I went into medicine When Dr Ornish published his Lifestyle Heart Trial years later proving with quantitative angiography that coronary artery disease could indeed be reversed in the majority of patients without drugs or surgery—just a plantbased diet and other healthy lifestyle changes I assumed that it was going to be a gamechanger My family had seen it with their own eyes but finally here it was in black and white published in one of the world’s most prestigious medical journals on the planet But nothing happened— leaving me to wonder if effectively the cure to our 1 killer could get lost down some rabbit hole and ignored then what else might be in the medical literature that can help my patients I made it my life’s mission to find out For those of you unfamiliar with my work every year I read through every issue of every Englishlanguage nutrition journal in the world—so busy folks like you don’t have to I then compile all the most interesting the most groundbreaking the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day to my nonprofit site NutritionFactsorg Everything on the website is free There are no ads no corporate sponsorships It’s strictly noncommercial not selling anything I just put it up as a public service as a labor of love New videos and articles every day on the latest in evidencebased nutrition What a concept Where did Pritikin get his evidence from A network of missionary hospitals set up by Western doctors throughout subSaharan Africa uncovered what may be one of the most important advances in health according to one of our most famous medical figures of the 20th century Dr Denis Burkitt the fact that many of the most common and major diseases “in modern Western culture are universally rare in third world communities” Like heart disease This landmark article from the 50s started out with a shocking statement “In the African population of Uganda coronary heart disease is almost nonexistent” Wait a second our 1 cause of death almost nonexistent What were they eating They were eating a lot of starchy vegetables starchy grains and greens and their protein almost exclusively from plant sources and they had the cholesterol levels to prove it Actually very similar to those eating modernday plantbased diets Maybe the Africans were just dying early from some other kind of diseases—and so never lived long enough to have a heart attack No here are agematched heart attack rates in Uganda versus St Louis Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda only one myocardial infarction Out of 632 age and gendermatched autopsies in Missouri 136 myocardial infarctions more than 100 times the rate of our 1 killer In fact they were so blown away they went back and did another 800 autopsies in Uganda and still just that one small healed infarct meaning it wasn’t even the cause of death out of 1427 patients—less than one in a thousand whereas here heart disease is an epidemic This is a list of diseases commonly found in the US and in populations that eat and live like the US but are rare or even nonexistent in populations centering their diets around whole plant foods These are among our most common diseases like obesity for example or hiatal hernia one of the most common stomach problems Varicose veins and hemorrhoids—two of the most common venous problems colorectal cancer—a leading cause of cancerrelated death diverticulitis—the 1 disease of the intestines appendicitis—the 1 cause of emergency abdominal surgery gallbladder disease—the 1 cause of nonemergency abdominal surgery as well as ischemic heart disease—the commonest cause of death here but a rarity among plantbased populations This suggests heart disease may be a choice Like cavities If you look at the teeth of people who lived over 10000 years before the invention of the toothbrush they pretty much had no cavities Didn’t brush a day in their lives no flossing yet no cavities That’s because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet Why do people continue to get cavities when we know they’re preventable through diet Simple Because the pleasure people derive from dessert may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist’s chair for many people And that’s fine Look as long as people understand the consequences of their actions as a physician what more can I do If you’re an adult and decide the benefits outweigh the risks for you and your family then go for it—I certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence I’ve got a good dental plan But what if instead of the plaque on our teeth we’re talking about the plaque building up inside of our arteries This is another disease that can be prevented by changing our diet Now what are the consequences for you and your family Now we’re not talking about scraping tartar anymore Now we’re talking life and death The most likely reason that most of our loved ones will die is because of heart disease It’s still up to each of us to make our own decisions as to what to eat and how to live—but we should make these choices consciously educating ourselves about the predictable consequences of our actions Coronary heart disease atherosclerosis hardening of the arteries begins in childhood By age 10 the arteries of nearly all kids raised on the standard American diet already have fatty streaks—the first stage of the disease Then these plaques start forming in our 20s get worse in our 30s and then can start killing us off In our hearts it’s called a heart attack in our brains the same disease is called a stroke If there is anyone in this audience older than age 10 then the question isn’t whether or not to eat healthy to prevent heart disease it’s whether you want to reverse the heart disease that you already have Is that even possible When researchers took people with heart disease and put them on the kind of plantbased diet followed by those populations that didn’t suffer from heart disease their hope was to slow the disease process down—maybe even stop it But instead something miraculous happened The disease started to reverse to get better As soon as patients stopped eating an arteryclogging diet their arteries started opening up Their bodies were able to start dissolving some of the plaque away Even in some cases of severe triple vessel heart disease arteries opened up without drugs without surgery—suggesting their bodies wanted to heal all along but were just never given the chance This improvement in blood flow to the heart is after just three weeks of eating healthy Let me share with you the bestkept secret in medicine The bestkept secret in medicine is that sometimes given the right conditions our body can heal itself If you whack your shin really hard on a coffee table it can get all red hot swollen and inflamed but will heal naturally if we just stand back and let our body work its magic But what if we kept whacking it in the same place three times a day breakfast lunch and dinner every day It’d never heal You’d go to your doctor and say “My shin hurts” And the doctor would be like no problem whip out their pad and write you a prescription for painkillers You’re still whacking your shin three times a day but it feels so much better with the pain pills on board Thank heavens for modern medicine It’s like when taking nitroglycerine for crushing chest pain Tremendous relief but you’re not actually treating the underlying cause of the disease Our body wants to come back to health if we let it But if we keep reinjuring it three times a day we may never heal It’s like smoking One of the most amazing things I learned in medical school was that within about 15 years of stopping smoking our lung cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker Isn’t that amazing Our lungs can clear out all that tar and eventually it’s almost as if we never started smoking at all Every morning of our smoking life that healing process started until wham our first cigarette of the day reinjuring our lungs with every puff Just like we can reinjure our arteries with every bite when all we had to do all along—the miracle cure was to just stand back get out of the way stop redamaging ourselves and let our bodies’ natural healing processes bring us back towards health Sure you could choose moderation and hit yourself with a smaller hammer But why beat yourself up at all The human body is a selfhealing machine We’ve known about this for decades American Heart Journal 1977 cases like Mr FW here such severe angina he couldn’t even make it to the mailbox but then started eating healthier and a few months later he was climbing mountains no pain There are some fancy new antiangina drugs on the market now that cost thousands of dollars a year But at the highest dose they can successfully prolong exercise duration extending the time someone can walk on a treadmill as long as 33 12 seconds It does not look like those choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon You see plantbased diets aren’t just safer and cheaper but they can work better Killer 2 is cancer What happens if we put cancer on a plantbased diet Dean Ornish and colleagues found that the progression of prostate cancer could be reversed with a plantbased diet and other healthy lifestyle behaviors—and no wonder If you drip the blood of those eating the standard American diet onto cancer cells growing in a petri dish cancer growth is cut down by about 9 But put people on a plantbased diet for a year though and their blood can do this The blood circulating within the bodies of those eating plantbased diets has nearly eight times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth Now this was for prostate cancer—the leading cancer killer specific to men In women it’s breast cancer So researchers tried duplicating the study with women using breast cancer cells instead They didn’t want to wait a whole year to get the results though So they figured they’d see what a healthy diet could do in just two weeks against three different types of human breast cancer cells This was the before cancer growth powering away at 100 And then after eating a plantbased diet for 14 days Here’s the before picture a layer of breast cancer cells is laid down in a petri dish and then blood from women eating the standard American diet is dripped on them And as you can see even people eating crappy diets have some ability to break down cancer But after just two weeks eating healthy blood was drawn from those same women—so they acted as their own controls—dripped on another carpet of breast cancer cells and this is what they were left with just a few individual cancer cells left Their bodies just cleaned up Before and after just two weeks eating healthy Their blood became that much more hostile to cancer Slowing down the growth of cancer cells is nice but getting rid of them is even better This is what’s called apoptosis programmed cell death After eating healthy their own bodies were able to reprogram the cancer cells forcing them into early retirement This is what’s called TUNEL imaging measuring DNA fragmentation or cell death Dying cells show up as white spots So again this is the before—what the blood of the average woman eating a standard American diet can do to breast cancer cells Her blood may be able to kill off a few But then after 14 days of healthy plantbased living her blood can do this It’s like she’s an entirely different person inside The same blood that was now coursing through these women’s bodies gained the power to significantly slow down and stop breast cancer cell growth within just two weeks of eating a plantbased diet What kind of blood do we want in our body what kind of immune system Do we want blood that just kind of rolls over when new cancer cells pop up or do we want blood circulating to every nook and cranny of our body with the power to slow down and stop them Now this dramatic strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plantbased diet and exercise they had these women out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day Well wait a second if you do two things how do you know what role the diet played So the researchers decided to put it to the test This is measuring cancer cell clearance This is what we saw before the effect of blood taken from those who ate a plantbased diet—in this case for an average of 14 years—along with mild exercise like just walking every day Plantbased diet and walking—that’s the kind of cancer cell clearance you get Compare that to the cancerstopping power of your average sedentary meateater which is basically nonexistent This middle group is interesting though Instead of 14 years on a plantbased diet ate 14 years of a standard American diet— but had 14 years of daily strenuous hourlong exercise like calisthenics The researchers wanted to know if you exercise long enough if you exercise hard enough can you rival some strolling planteaters And the answer is exercise helped—no question but literally 5000 hours in the gym was no match for a plantbased diet Same thing as before Even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes your body’s not totally defenseless Your bloodstream can kill off a few cancer cells But here’s the hard core strenuous exercise group killing off cancer cells left and right But nothing appears to kick more cancer tush than a plantbased diet We think it’s because of the animal proteins—meat egg white and dairy proteins—increasing the level of IGF1 in our bodies Insulinlike growth factor1 a cancerpromoting growth hormone involved in the acquisition and progression of malignant tumors But if we lower animal protein intake if you put people on a plantbased diet their IGF1 levels go down and if you put people on a plantbased diet for years their levels drop even further And their IGF1 binding protein levels go up That’s one way our body tries to protect itself from cancer—from excessive growth—by releasing a binding protein into our bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF1 It’s like our body’s emergency brake Yes in as little as two weeks a plantbased diet can bring down your liver’s production of IGF1 But what about all the IGF1 circulating in your bloodstream from the bacon and eggs you had three weeks before So your liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to take it out of circulation And as you can see it just gets better and better the longer you eat healthy Here’s the experiment that nailed IGF1 as the villain same as last time Go on a plantbased diet cancer cell growth drops and cancer cell death shoots up But then here’s the kicker what if you added back to the cancer the exact same amount of IGF1 banished from your system just because you were eating healthy for two weeks It erases the diet and exercise effect It’s like you never started eating healthy at all So the reason the largest prospective study on diet and cancer ever found that the incidence of all cancers combined was lower among vegetarians than among meateaters may be because they eat less animal protein So they end up with less IGF1 which can mean less cancer growth How much less cancer are we talking about Middleaged men and women with high protein intakes had a 75 increase in total mortality and a four – fold increase in the risk of dying from cancer But not all proteins specifically animal protein which makes sense of course given the higher IGF1 levels The academic institution sent out a press release with a memorable opening line “That chicken wing you’re eating could be as deadly as a cigarette” explaining that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer—”a mortality risk factor comparable to smoking” What was the response to the revelation that diets high in meat eggs and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking One nutrition scientist replied that it was potentially dangerous to compare the effects of smoking with the effect of meat and cheese Why Because a smoker might think “Why bother quitting smoking if my ham and cheese sandwich is just as bad for me” So better not to tell anyone about the whole meat and dairy thing That reminds me of a famous Philip Morris cigarette ad that tried to downplay the risks by saying “You think secondhand smoke is bad increasing the risk of lung cancer 19 Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of milk every day may be three times as bad—62 increased risk of lung cancer” Or doubling the risk by frequently cooking with oil or tripling your risk of heart disease by eating nonvegetarian or multiplying your risk sixfold by eating lots of meat and dairy So they conclude “Let’s keep a sense of perspective here” The risk of lung cancer from secondhand smoke may be “well below the risk reported for other everyday activities” So breathe deep That’s like saying “Don’t worry about getting stabbed because getting shot is so much worse” Uh how about neither Two risks don’t make a right You’ll note Philip Morris stopped throwing dairy under the bus when they purchased Kraft Foods Okay what about the other 13 leading causes of death The top three killers used to be heart disease cancer and stroke Oh that is so 2007 Now it’s heart disease cancer and COPD—chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases like emphysema Thankfully COPD can be prevented with the help of a plantbased diet and even treated with plants improving lung function over time Of course the tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently Instead of adding plants to one’s diet to help one’s lung function wouldn’t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes And indeed the addition of açaí berries to cigarettes evidently has a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice Who would have thunk it Next they’re going to be putting berries in meat And indeed I couldn’t make this stuff up The addition of fruit extracts to burgers was not without its glitches though The blackberries “literally dyed burger patties with a distinct purplish colour”—though evidently infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in does evidently improve tenderness And it’s even possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurters with powdered grape seeds though there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product And if there’s one thing we know about hot dogeaters it’s that they’re picky about what goes in their food Pig anus Okay but grape seeds Eww Strokes are killer 4 Preventing strokes may be all about eating potassiumrich foods yet most Americans don’t even reach the recommended minimum daily intake And by most I mean more than 98 98 of us eat potassiumdeficient diets because 98 of us don’t eat enough plants Potassium comes from the words pot ash You take any plant put it in a pot and reduce it to ash and you’re left with potashium socalled vegetable alkali True story but can anyone name me a plant food particularly high in potassium Bananas right I don’t know why that’s like the one thing everyone knows about nutrition Chiquita must have had a great PR firm or something But it turns out that bananas don’t even make the top 50 sources coming in at number 86 right behind fast food vanilla milk shakes It goes fast food vanilla milk shakes then bananas In fact when I was researching for my new book I found out that the USDA expanded their list and now bananas don’t even make the top thousand sources coming in at number 1611 right after Reese’s Pieces I kid you not The most concentrated whole food sources of potassium in the diet are beans and greens and dates Bananas don’t make it to a thousand—in fact if you look at the next leading cause of death unintentional injuries bananas could be downright dangerous Alzheimer’s disease is now our sixth leading killer now striking a staggering four million Americans affected Twenty years ago it wasn’t even in the top ten According to the latest dietary guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer’s the two most important things we can do cut down our consumption of meat dairy and junk and replace those with vegetables beans fruits and whole grains This is based in part on data going back over 20 years now Those who eat meat—red meat or white meat it doesn’t matter—appear between two to three times more likely to become demented later in life compared to those that don’t eat meat And the longer one eats meatfree the lower the risk of dementia drops Next on the list type 2 diabetes which we can prevent arrest and reverse with a plantbased diet—something we’ve known since back in the 1930s Within five years about a quarter of the diabetics were able to get off insulin But plantbased diets are lowcalorie diets Maybe their diabetes just got better because they lost so much weight To tease that out what we would need is a study where researchers switch people to a healthy diet but force them to eat so much food that they wouldn’t lose any weight despite eating healthier Then we could see if plantbased diet had unique benefits beyond all the weight loss We’d have to wait 44 years but here it is subjects were weighed every day and if they started losing weight they were made to eat more food In fact so much food some of the participants had problems eating it all—like “not another tostada not another salad” But they eventually adapted so there was no significant alteration in body weight despite restricting meat dairy eggs and junk So with zero weight loss did a plantbased diet still help Overall insulin requirements were cut about 60 and half were able to get off insulin altogether despite no change in weight How many years did this take No 16 days So we’re talking diabetics who’ve had diabetes for as long as 20 years injecting 20 units of insulin a day And then as few as 13 days later they’re off of all insulin altogether thanks to less than two weeks on a plantbased diet—even with zero weight loss Diabetes for 20 years then off all insulin in two weeks Diabetes for 20 years because no one had told them about a plantbased diet Here’s patient 15 32 units of insulin on the control diet and then 18 days later on none Lower blood sugars on 32 units less insulin That’s the power of plants This was without weight loss his body just started working that much better And as a bonus their cholesterol dropped like a rock to under 150 in just 16 days Just like moderate changes in diet usually result in only modest reductions in cholesterol how moderate do you want your diabetes Everything in moderation may be a truer statement than many people realize Moderate changes in diet can leave diabetics with moderate vision loss moderate kidney failure and moderate amputations—maybe just a few toes or something Moderation in all things is not necessarily a good thing That study that purported to show that diets high in meat eggs and dairy could be as harmful to health as smoking supposedly suggested that people who eat lots of animal protein are four times as likely to die from cancer or diabetes But if you look at the actual study you’ll see that’s not true Those eating lots of animal protein didn’t have just four times more risk of dying from diabetes they had 73 times higher risk of dying from diabetes Those who chose moderation—eating a moderate amount of animal protein—only had 23 times the risk of death from diabetes Killer 8 is kidney failure which may be both prevented and treated with a plantbased diet And no surprise kidneys are highly vascular organs Harvard researchers found three dietary risk factors for declining kidney function animal protein animal fat and cholesterol Animal fat can alter the actual structure of our kidneys based on studies like this showing plugs of fat literally clogging up the works in autopsied kidneys And the animal protein can have a profound effect on normal kidney function inducing what’s called hyperfiltration increasing the workload on the kidney but not plant protein Eat some tuna fish and you can see increased pressure on the kidneys one two and three hours after the meal shoots right up If instead of having a tuna salad sandwich though you had a tofu salad sandwich with the same amount of protein no effect Kidneys can deal with plant protein without even batting an eyelash Why does animal protein cause the overload reaction but not plant protein It appears to be due to inflammation triggered by the animal protein We know this because if you give a powerful antiinflammatory drug along with the tuna fish you can actually abolish that hyperfiltration effect that protein leakage effect in response to meat ingestion Then there’s the acid load Animal protein induces the formation of acid within the kidney which may lead to tubular toxicity damage to the delicate urinemaking tubes within the kidney Animal foods tend to be acidforming whereas plant foods tend to either be relatively neutral or actually alkaline base forming to counteract some of that acid So the solution to halting the progression of chronic kidney disease might lie in the produce aisle rather than the pharmacy aisle No wonder plantbased diets have been used to treat kidney disease for decades Here’s protein leakage on the lowsodium diet that physicians would conventionally put these patients on switched to a supplemented vegan diet conventional plantbased conventional plantbased—turning kidney dysfunction on and off like a light switch based on what’s going into their mouths Killer 9 is respiratory infections What possible role could diet play You obviously haven’t seen my video Kale and the Immune System talking about the immunostimulatory effects of kale Is there anything kale cannot do Boosting antibody production sevenfold but that’s in a petri dish What about in people Older men and women were split into two groups right before they were going to get their Pneumovax vaccination their pneumonia vaccination Half continued to eat as they always had The other half added just a few servings of fruits and vegetables to their daily diet and after getting their injection you can see a significant improvement in the protective antibody immune response from that one simple change That wasn’t cutting out meat just adding fruits and vegetables can significantly improve immune function Killer 10 is suicide We’ve known those eating healthier have healthier mood states—in fact only about half the depression anxiety and stress scores compared to those that eat meat Researchers suspect it’s the arachidonic acid this inflammatory long chain omega6 fatty acid found predominantly in chicken and eggs That’s where it’s predominantly found in the American diet But you can’t tell if it’s cause and effect until you put it to the test They took people eating the standard American diet and removed meat fish poultry and eggs from their diets and got a significant improvement in mood scores within just two weeks Thanks perhaps to the removal of arachidonic acid from their bodies which they thought may be adversely impacting mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation brain inflammation but we could bring that down within a matter of weeks after cutting eggs chicken and other meat Now am I just cherry picking though What about all the randomized controlled trials like that showing that other diets have improved mood There aren’t any A recent review concluded that only the plantbased study fit the bill It’s hard to cherry pick when there’s only one cherry Works in a workplace setting too significant increases in physical functioning general health vitality and mental health—not surprisingly translating into improved work productivity The biggest such study across 15 corporate sites at Geico found that plantbased diets resulted in significant reported improvements in depression anxiety stress fatigue and emotional wellbeing So lifestyle interventions such as exercise can help mental as well as physical health And among the most effective of these is the use of plantbased diets Killer 11 is blood infections Sure foodborne bacteria can kind of burrow through the bloodstream and directly invade through the intestinal wall—but in women may creep up into their bladder We’ve known for decades that it’s bacteria creeping up from the rectum that cause bladder infections But only recently did we figure out where that rectal reservoir of bladderinfecting E coli was coming from chicken We now have DNA fingerprinting proof of a direct link between farm animals meat and bladder infections—solid evidence that urinary tract infections can be a zoonosis bladder infections as an animaltohuman disease Wait a second Can’t I just use a meat thermometer and cook the meat through No because of crosscontamination We’ve known for decades that if you give someone a frozen chicken to prepare and cook in their own kitchen as they normally would a multitude of antibioticresistant E coli jump from the chicken into the gut of the volunteer —before they even eat it So you could incinerate it to ash you don’t even have to eat any of it And it still wouldn’t matter because you already infected yourself just handling it Within days the drugresistant chicken bacteria had multiplied to the point of becoming a major part of the person’s gut flora The chicken bacteria were like taking over their intestines Even if you follow all the safe handling guidelines rinsing everything with bleach—even spraying bleach on for good measure there still may be pathogenic fecal bacteria left behind No one actually does this but what if you did this and then came in later and swabbed kitchen surfaces Researchers found pathogenic fecal bacteria salmonella campylobacter—both serious human pathogens still left behind in the kitchen The reason that most people have more bacteria from feces in their kitchen sink than on their toilet seat is because most people rinse chickens in the sink not the toilet So unless our kitchen is like some biohazard lab the only way to guarantee we’re not going to leave infection around the kitchen is to not bring it into our homes in the first place The good news is that it’s not like you eat chicken once and you’re colonized for life In this study the chicken bacteria only seemed to last about ten days before our good bacteria were able to muscle them out of the way The problem is that most families eat chicken more than once every ten days so they may be constantly reintroducing these chicken bugs into their systems But wait a second You can’t sell unsafe cars you can’t sell unsafe toys how is it legal to sell unsafe meat They do it by blaming the consumer As one USDA poultry microbiologist said “Raw meats are not idiotproof They can be mishandled and when they are it’s like handling a hand grenade If you pull the pin somebody’s going to get hurt” See if we get sick it’s our fault While some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in supermarkets the USDA poultry expert disagrees “I think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it” That’s like a car company saying yeah we installed faulty brakes but it’s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt The head of the CDC’s food poisoning division responded famously to this kind of blamethevictim attitude coming from the meat industry “Is it reasonable that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger their threeyearold dies” Is that reasonable Not to worry though the meat industry is on it They got the FDA approval for a bacteriaeating virus to spray on the meat Now the industry is concerned that consumer acceptance of bacteriaeating viruses may present something of a challenge to the food industry But if they think that’s going to be a challenge check out their other bright idea The “Effect of Extracted Housefly Pupae Peptide Mixture on Chilled Pork Preservation”—this is a sciencey way of saying they want to smear a maggot mixture on meat Now wait—it’s a lowcost and simple method Think about it maggots thrive on rotting meat However there have been no reports that maggots have any serious diseases so they must be packed with some sort of antibacterial something Have you ever seen a maggot sneeze I didn’t think so So they took maggots at three days old washed them toweled them off a little Vitamix action and voilà Safer meat We did kidney failure what about liver failure We’ve known for decades that a plantbased diet could be used to treat liver failure significantly reducing the toxins that would otherwise build up eating meat without a fully functional liver to detoxify your blood I do have to admit though that some people on plantbased diets have worsening liver function They’re called alcoholics Living on potatoes corn grapes and barley—in fact strictly plantbased yet still not doing so hot High blood pressure is next affecting nearly 78 million Americans That’s one in three of us And as we age our pressures get higher and higher such that by age 60 it strikes more than half Wait a second If it affects most of us when we get older maybe it’s less a disease and more just an inevitable consequence of aging No We’ve known since the 1920s that high blood pressure need not occur Researchers measured the blood pressures of a thousand people in rural Kenya who ate a diet centered around whole plant foods Starchy vegetables whole grains beans vegetables fruit and dark green leafies Our pressures go up as we age their pressures actually go down And the lower the better The whole 140 over 90 cutoff is arbitrary Even people who start out with blood pressure under 120 over 80 appear to benefit from blood pressure reduction So the ideal blood pressure the nobenefitfromreducingitfurther blood pressure is actually 110 over 70 But is it even possible to get blood pressures down to 110 over 70 It’s not just possible it’s normal—for those eating healthy enough diets Over two years at a rural Kenyan hospital 1800 patients were admitted How many cases of high blood pressure did they find Zero Wow So they must have had low rates of heart disease No they had no rates of heart disease Not a single case of arteriosclerosis our 1 killer was found Rural China too about 110 over 70 their entire lives 70yearolds had the same average blood pressure as 16yearolds Now of course Africa and China have vastly different diets but they share this common theme that they are plantbased daytoday with meat only eaten on special occasions Why do we think it’s the plantbased nature of their diets that was so protective Because in the Western world as the American Heart Association has pointed out the only folks really getting down that low are those eating strictly plantbased diets coming in at an average of 110 over 65 Based on the largest study of those eating plantbased diets to date—89000 Californians—there appears to be a stepwise drop in blood pressure rates as people eat more and more plantbased Same thing with diabetes and obesity The more and more healthy we eat the better Yes you can wipe out most of your risk eating strictly plantbased but it’s not black and white all or nothing Any movement along the spectrum towards healthier eating can accrue significant benefits You can show this experimentally You take vegetarians and give them meat pay them enough to eat it and their blood pressures go up Or you remove meat from their diet and their blood pressures go down—in just seven days And this is after the vast majority reduced or stopped their blood pressure medications completely They had to reduce their medications because their pressures were getting so low that if they were on drugs they could fall over and crack their heads open Lower pressures on fewer drugs that’s the power of plants So does the American Heart Association recommend a nomeat diet No they recommend a lowmeat diet the socalled DASH diet Why not vegetarian When the DASH diet was created were they just not aware of this landmark research done by Harvard’s Frank Sacks No they were aware of the landmark research The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Frank Sacks See the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the 1 goal of capturing the blood pressurelowering benefits of a vegetarian diet yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public They didn’t think the public could handle the truth In their defense you can see what they were thinking Just like drugs never work unless you actually take them diets never work unless you actually eat them So you can’t tell people to eat plantbased—they won’t do it So they figured they might help more on a population scale if they just softpedaled the truth to make it more acceptable Alright tell that to the thousand families a day that lose a loved one to high blood pressure Maybe it’s time to tell the American public the truth Killer 14 is Parkinson’s disease Does a plantbased diet reduce risk of Parkinson’s disease Well most studies to date do suggest a link between dairy products and Parkinson’s—but why Well there’s evidence that milk is contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals High levels of pesticide residues are found in the milk supply and in the brains of people who die from Parkinson’s disease And there are other pollutants like tetrahydroisoquiniline which is actually what scientists use to try to induce Parkinson’s in primates—and which is found mostly in cheese So maybe the dairy industry should require toxin screenings of the milk supply Good luck with that You could always just not drink it but then what would happen to your bones That’s a marketing ploy if you look at the actual science milk does not appear to protect against hip fracture risk whether drinking during your adult years or drinking milk during your teen years If anything milk consumption was associated with an increase in fracture risk Maybe this is why hip fracture rates are highest in populations with the greatest milk consumption where they drink the most milk Swedish researchers decided to put it to the test 100000 men and women followed for up to 20 years and milkdrinking women had higher rates of death more heart disease and significantly more cancer for each daily glass of milk Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of premature death And they had significantly more bone and hip fractures too More milk more fractures Milkdrinking men also had higher rates of death But for some reason you never see milk ads like this image of milk carton among gravestones Finally aspiration pneumonia which is caused by swallowing problems due to Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s or a stroke—all of which we’ve already covered So where does this leave us These are the top fifteen reasons that Americans die and a plantbased diet can help prevent nearly all of them can help treat more than half of them and even in some cases even reverse the progression of disease including our top three killers There are drugs that in some circumstances can help too You can take one drug to treat cholesterol every day for the rest of your life another drug for blood sugars a couple different pills for high blood pressure The same diet though does it all It’s not like there’s a liverhealthy diet and a hearthealthy diet and a different brainhealthy diet No a liverhealthy diet is a hearthealthy diet is a brainhealthy diet One diet to rule them all And what about drug side effects I’m not talking a little rash or something Prescription drugs kill more than 100000 Americans every year Wait a second—106000 deaths a year That means that the sixth leading cause of death is actually doctors The sixth leading cause of death… is me Thankfully I can be prevented with a plantbased diet Seriously though compared to 15000 American vegetarians meateaters had about twice the odds of being on aspirin sleeping pills tranquilizers antacids painkillers blood pressure medications laxatives of course and insulin So plantbased diets are great for those that don’t like taking drugs those that don’t like paying for drugs and for people that don’t like risking drug side effects Want to solve the healthcare crisis I’ve got a suggestion There is only one diet that’s ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients—a plantbased diet Anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet ask them one simple question “Has it been proven to reverse heart disease You know the most likely reason you and everyone you love will die” If the answer is no why would you even consider it If that’s all a plantbased diet could do—reverse our 1 killer then shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven otherwise And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing treating and reversing other leading killers would seem to make the case for plantbased eating overwhelming Most deaths in the United States are preventable and related to nutrition According to the most rigorous analysis of risk factors ever published the 1 cause of death in the United States and the 1 cause of disability is our diet which has since bumped tobacco smoking to killer 2 Smoking now only kills about a half million Americans every year—whereas our diet now kills hundreds of thousands more So let me end with a thought experiment Imagine yourself a smoker back in the 1950s The average per capita cigarette consumption was about 4000 cigarettes a year Think about that In the 1950s the average American smoked a half a pack a day The media was telling you to smoke and famous athletes agreed Even Santa Claus I mean you want to keep fit and stay slender So you make sure to smoke and eat hot dogs to keep trim And eat lots of sugar to stay slim and trim Sugar is a lot better than that apple there right I mean sheesh Although apples do “connote goodness and freshness” reads one internal tobacco industry memo “which brings up many possibilities for making youthoriented cigarettes” They want to make appleflavored cigarettes for children Shameless “For digestion’s sake you smoke” I mean no curative power is claimed for Philip Morris—but an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure So better safe than sorry and smoke “Blow in her face and she’ll follow you anywhere” “No woman ever says no” They’re “so round so firm so fully packed” After all John Wayne smoked them until he got lung cancer and died Back then even the paleo folks were smoking and so were the doctors This is not to say there wasn’t controversy within the medical profession Yes some doctors smoked Camels but other doctors preferred Luckies So there was a little conflict there The leader of the US Senate agreed I mean who wouldn’t want to give their throat a vacation How could there be a single case of throat irritation when “cigarettes are just as pure as the water you drink” Perhaps in Flint Michigan And if you do get irritated No problem your doctor can always write you a prescription for cigarettes This is an ad in the Journal of the American Medical Association So when mainstream medicine is saying that smoking on balance is good for you when the American Medical Association is saying that where could you turn back then if you just wanted the facts What’s the new data advanced by science She was “too tired for fun…and then she smoked a Camel” Babe Ruth spoke of proof positive medical science—that is when he still could speak before he died of throat cancer Now if by some miracle there was a SmokingFactsorg website back then that could deliver the science directly bypassing commercially corruptible institutional filters you would have become aware of studies like this An Adventist study in California published in 1958 that showed that nonsmokers may have at least 90 lower lung cancer risk compared to smokers But this wasn’t the first When famed surgeon Michael DeBakey was asked why his studies published back in the 30s linking smoking and lung cancer were simply ignored he had to remind people about what it was like back then We were a smoking society It was in the movies it was everywhere Medical meetings were one heavy haze of smoke Smoking was in a word normal So back to our thought experiment if you’re a smoker in the 50s in the know what do you do Do you change or do you wait With access to the science you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your smoking habit is probably not good for you So do you change your smoking habits or do you wait If you wait until your physician tells you between puffs to quit you could have cancer by then If you wait until the powers that be officially recognize it like the Surgeon General did in the subsequent decade you could be dead by then It took 25 years for the Surgeon General’s report to come out It took more than 7000 studies and the deaths of countless smokers before the first Surgeon General’s report against smoking was finally released in the 1960s You’d think maybe after the first 6000 studies they could have given people a little heads up or something No it was a powerful industry So one wonders how many people are currently suffering needlessly from dietary diseases Maybe we should have stopped smoking after the 700th study like this came out As a smoker in the 50s on one hand you had all of society the government the medical profession itself telling you to smoke And on the other hand all you had was the science—if you were even lucky enough to be aware of studies like this Now fast forward 55 years There’s a new Adventist study out of California warning America about the risks of something else they may be putting in their mouths And it’s not just one study According to the latest review the total sum of evidence suggests that mortality from all causes put together and many of our dreaded diseases—heart disease stroke cancer diabetes—is significantly lower in those eating plantbased So instead of someone going along with America’s smoking habits in the 50s imagine you or someone you know going along with America’s eating habits today What do you do With access to the science you realize that the best available balance of evidence suggests that your eating habits are probably not so good for you So do you change your eating habits or do you wait If you wait until your physician tells you between bites to change your diet it may be too late In fact even after the Surgeon General’s report was released the medical community still dragged their feet The AMA actually went on record refusing to endorse the Surgeon General’s report Why Could that have been because they had just been handed 10 million from the tobacco industry Maybe not maybe it’s coincidence So we know why the AMA may have been sucking up to the tobacco industry—but why weren’t individual doctors speaking out Well there were a few gallant souls ahead of their time writing in as there are today standing up against industries killing millions But why not more Maybe it’s because the majority of physicians themselves smoked cigarettes just like the majority of physicians today continue to eat foods that are contributing to our epidemic of dietary diseases What was the AMA’s rallying cry back then Everything in moderation “Extensive scientific studies have proved that smoking in moderation” is okay Sound familiar Today the food industry uses the same tobacco industry tactics—supplying misinformation twisting the science The same scientistsforhire paid to downplay the risks of secondhand smoke and toxic chemicals are the same paid by the National Confectioners Association to downplay the risks of candy and the same hired by the meat industry to downplay the risks of meat Consumption of animal products and processed foods causes at least 14 million deaths around the world every year 14 million people dead every year Plantbased diets can now be considered the nutritional equivalent of quitting smoking How many more people have to die though before the CDC encourages people not to wait for openheart surgery to start eating healthy as well Until the system changes we need to take personal responsibility for our own health and for our family’s health We can’t wait until society catches up to the science because it’s a matter of life and death Last year Dr Kim Williams became President of the American College of Cardiology He

Support OneGreenPlanet Being publiclyfunded gives us a greater chance to continue providing you with high quality content Please support us Support Us There are many causes of habitat destruction including leveling land for development and deforestation resulting from the logging industry In total about 18 million acres of forest are lost worldwide every year This loss of habitat along with degradation resulting from the environmental impact of pollution and climate change is causing species to go extinct at a rate 1000 times faster than they would if humans weren’t in the picture And while we certainly need to pay attention to these causes and do our part to lessen their impact on the environment the oftenoverlooked threat to animal habitats and our environment is agriculture which is draining our world of its biodiversity through habitat destruction Advertisement According to the World Wildlife Fund “around 50 percent of the world’s habitable land has been converted to farming land” But when we think about agriculture we need to look beyond the grasslands used for grazing livestock and the acres of land dedicated to massive farming operations or even the land used to grow vegetables and grains for human consumption Why Because 33 percent of agricultural land worldwide is used solely for livestock feed production And when you combine that with the amount of land used for grazing and housing animals you’ll realize that we have a huge problem Most of Our Grain is Being Consumed by Animals Not Humans SoapWitchpixabay Approximately 70 billion farm animals are being raised for food annually In 2015 people in the US consumed 248 billion pounds of beef with the majority of that cattle being raised in massive feedlots Those cattle in addition to other feedlot animals like chickens and pigs are consuming 70 percent of the grain grown in the US According to the USDA’s website corn barley oats and sorghum are used as major feed grains in the US with corn “accounting for more than 95 percent of total feed grain and production use” In the US 36 percent of corn crops being used to feed livestock Soy is also commonly used in feed with 75 percent of global soybean crops being fed to livestock To support these crops onethird of arable land being used for feed production globally using vast amounts of land and water resources Advertisement Forests Are Being Cleared at an Alarming Rate Sam Beebe flickr The world’s tropical rainforests are home to over 13 million species — or around twothirds of all plants and animals The Amazon Rainforest alone is home to more than 2000 known species of mammals birds reptiles and amphibians It also houses 40000 known plant species some of which play an important role in the treatment of diseases like cancer Worldwide forests serve as the habitat for over 80 percent of the world’s animals and an estimated 16 billion people rely on forests for everything from food and water to shelter Advertisement Agriculture is responsible for a staggering 80 percent of deforestation causing humans and animals to lose their homes and throwing entire ecosystems — as well as our planet — off balance Soy production is one major culprit destroying four million hectares of forest in South America every year But before you go blaming tofu remember that the vast majority of soy is being used to feed livestock not humans Pesticides and Fertilizers Are Poisoning Aquatic Habitats Aqua Mechanical flickr Advertisement Crop production also poses a serious threat to marine life and freshwater species Since most crops are maintained using nitrogen fertilizer and herbicides both of which contribute to the pollution of our land these pollutants are contaminating nearby lakes rivers and streams — and eventually the ocean Excessive amounts of nutrients in the water can result in algal blooms and deplete oxygen levels in lakes and oceans resulting in dead zones where fish turtles and other animals are unable to survive When this happens the animals either leave the area or die The Gulf of Mexico has the secondlargest dead zone due to the pollution that’s emptied into it after being carried downstream from as far as Canada There are currently around 400 dead zones in the world’s oceans As a result over 130 federally protected species are in danger of extinction What You Can Do With the world’s population estimated to reach over nine billion people by 2050 we need to take a serious look at our food choices It takes one acre of land to produce 250 pounds of beef where that same amount of land can produce 30000 pounds of carrots or 53000 pounds of potatoes By eating less meat we can also help fight climate change reduce our water footprint reduce pollution and prevent further habitat destruction and species extinction It’s a simple way to make a big impact for humans and the environment You can EatForThePlanet starting today Just follow the three simple steps below 1 Replace Try to swap animalbased products in your daily diet with vegan alternatives milk butter mayo cheese grilled chicken beef crumbles sausages cold cuts etc 2 Embrace Add plantbased whole foods local and organic when possible to your diet like greens fresh fruits and vegetables whole grains plant proteins like lentils nutsseeds beans tofu etc 3 Moderate Limit consumption of your favorite meats like beef lamb pork etc “The EatForThePlanet Way is not about restricting your diet but about changing the way you think about your food choices” says Zacharias “When you Eat for the Planet you make the conscious decision to reduce your negative impact on the world around you” We all have the power to create a better future for our children and the countless animals we share the planet with by making one easy swap If you’re ready to start doing this in your own life check out One Green Planet’s EatForThePlanet campaign Advertisement For more Animal Earth Life Vegan Food Health and Recipe

opened a huge vertical farm and it could be a sign of things to come globally The lettuce you love so much could soon be produced in a windowless warehouse by Fermin Koop December 13 2020 in Environment Environmental Issues News Science When you look at a lush green delicious plant you probably tend to think it comes from a fertile land somewhere in the world Well that might no longer be the only option out there A vertical farm just opened up in an old warehouse without windows in Copenhagen and it expects to produce 1000 tons of produce per year by 2021 showing that vertical farms really do have a solid future Image credit Nordic Harvest They won’t see the light of day or have access to soil but hundreds of tons of lettuce herbs and kale among other produce will soon be coming out of the vertical farm The advantage of the vertical farm is that it takes less space than a conventional crop helping to meet the world’s food demand and producing food locally instead of importing it Around 37 of the earth’s landmass is used for agriculture according to the World Bank But climate change and conflicts can challenge the availability of land for farming not to even mention soil erosion — one of the major environmental issues that often fly under the radar A quarter of the world’s productive lands have already been degraded according to the World Food Programme challenging food security ADVERTISEMENT The project is run by YesHealth Group a Taiwanese company with a long record developing vertical farming technology in partnership with Nordic Harvest a Danish startup that wants to use technology to make food production more sustainable YesHealth already runs in Taiwan the largest vertical farm in China It’s not actually a brandnew idea as vertical farms have been around for almost a decade They first took in Asia and the United States which has the world’s biggest vertical farm located in a steel mill in New Jersey and producing two million pounds of produce every year But the idea is now also catching up in Europe Get more science news like this Join the ZME newsletter for amazing science news features and exclusive scoops More than 40000 subscribers cant be wrong Daily Weekly I have read and agree to the terms conditions Leave this field empty if youre human “We offer a more sustainable way of producing food yearround locally without disturbing nature” founder of Nordic Harvest Anders Riemann told Reuters “We take some of the food production back into the cities where you can grow in a much smaller land and spaceoptimized in the height” The farm is installed in a 7000 square meter hall and has 14 shelves of greens stacked up toward the ceiling in aluminum boxes It’s all automated with robots used to move the shelves into position and stack the produce When fully operational the farm will be hermetically sealed to secure the farming conditions ADVERTISEMENT Image credit Nordic Harvest Water consumption will be between 90 and 95 lower compared to traditional farming No artificial fertilizers pesticides or other toxic chemicals will be used About 200 tons of produce will be harvested in the first quarter of 2021 but this would reach 1000 annually when the farm runs at full capacity by end of 2021 The project also addresses one of the frequent criticism vertical farms have the fact that they require a vast amount of electricity to provide artificial light — but for Denmark that won’t be too big of a problem The farm uses 20000 specialized LEDs lightbulbs manufactured by YesHealth that are powered by renewable energy from Denmark’s extensive wind farms “A vertical farm is characterized by not harming the environment by recycling all the water and nutrition or fertilizer” said Riemann “In our case we use 100 energy from windmills which makes us CO2neutral” Denmark reported recordbreaking wind power in 2019 covering 47 of the country’s electricity demands for the entire year Out of the 47 most came from onshore 29 although offshore also generated a healthy amount 18 The country expects to keep expanding renewables as a way to reduce its emissions Edit The title of the article mistakenly stated that it is a wind farm This has now been corrected Tags vertical farm Fermin Koop Fermin Koop is a reporter from Buenos Aires Argentina He holds an MSc from Reading University UK on Environment and

legal decision against the makers of glyphosate is not supported by the science Steven Novella on April 3 2019 Shares Glyphosate has been in the new recently because of the recent court case in which a jury awarded DeWayne Johnson 289 million dollars from Monsanto for glyphosate allegedly causing his lymphoma This of course is used as support for those who claim that glyphosate is unsafe and also for antiGMO rhetoric as some GMOs are engineered to be tolerant of glyphosate to facilitate its use as an herbicide I wrote about this case last year but now it is back as Johnson prevailed in appeal I also wrote about the science behind glyphosate in 2014 There have been some significant studies since then so in light of the recent attention the herbicide is getting an update is warranted There are two basic safety issues with glyphosate – exposure in the general population mostly from consuming food that was grown using glyphosate and agricultural exposure The first question is easier to answer A 2017 review found Two complementary exposure assessments humanbiomonitoring and foodresiduesmonitoring suggests that actual exposure levels are below these reference values and do not represent a public concern This has been the consistent finding of studies for decades The level of exposure for the general public even with the increased agricultural use in the last 20 years is well below safety limits Why then did the IARC designate glyphosate as a probable carcinogen They famously left out the most updated data to which they had access Also their designation is an outlier Other reviewers did not reach the same conclusion The data that was excluded from the WHO’s assessment is the 2018 Agricultural Health Study This study which included 50000 people found In this large prospective cohort study no association was apparent between glyphosate and any solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies overall including NHL and its subtypes There was some evidence of increased risk of AML among the highest exposed group that requires confirmation This large and fairly definitive study especially when put in the context of all the other studies puts to bed the notion that there is any significant risk from general exposure to glyphosate As we always point out – there is no such thing as zero risk But we can use evidence to set probable limits on how large a remaining risk might be The health risk of general exposure to glyphosate is anywhere from nothing to negligible – it has vanished into the background risk of just being alive But this study also brings us to the second consideration – the risk of agricultural workers who might be exposed to much higher levels than the general population Toxicity is always about dose and so it is plausible while there is no risk to the general population there is a risk from much higher exposure As an aside this is why the frequent challenge to those simply pointing out the science on the safety of glyphosate to drink a glass of the stuff “if you think it’s so safe” is absurd There are countless things that we consume and are exposed to all the time that I would not drink an entire glass of That is not the threshold for safety There have been studies that show a small association between agricultural exposure to glyphosate and NHL NonHodgkin Lymphoma This association shows up in a recent metaanalysis but only for the highest exposure group They found a relative risk increase of 41 but this translates to an absolute risk increase of 8 per 100000 or 0008 This study has also been criticized for the methods of metaanalysis used For example they had to determine how to combine very different data that uses different definitions of exposure Some scientists have argued that the data does not support the conclusions A recent study not included in that metaanalysis however which was a large analysis looking at many pesticides and lymphoma outcomes found During followup 2430 NHL cases were diagnosed in 316 270 farmers accruing 3 574 815 personyears under risk Most metaHRs suggested no association Moderately elevated metaHRs were seen for NHL and ever use of terbufos metaHR 118 95 CI 100139 chronic lymphocytic leukaemiasmall lymphocytic lymphoma and deltamethrin 148 106207 and diffuse large Bcell lymphoma and glyphosate 136 100185 as well as inverse associations of NHL with the broader groups of organochlorine insecticides 086 074099 and phenoxy herbicides 081 067098 but not with active ingredients within these groups after adjusting for exposure to other pesticides This evidence is fairly weak The confidence interval for glyphosate includes 100 Also there was only a risk found for Bcell lymphoma not NHL Inconsistencies like that suggest the association may not be real At present from all existing evidence I think the best conclusion is that there may be a small correlation between the highest levels of agricultural exposure of glyphosate and some types of lymphoma but the existing evidence is not of sufficient quality and consistency for a final determination It does warrant further study but also indicates that any potential risk is likely small In the meantime it certainly makes sense for agricultural workers who deal with pesticides of any type to practice good safety – using protection suits and breathing masks for example There is another element of the DeWayne Johnson case that should be mentioned The delay between his exposure and diagnosis was too short it is argued to have been that actual cause of his NHL The legal case itself is complex and I do not intend to comment on the legal issues here My only intent is to the put the science into context Shares Posted in Epidemiology Legal Public Health Tagged in cancer Dewayne Johnson glyphosate Posted by

37,html Our Process – lēf Farms Fresh tasty lettuce grown nearby fresh is right here About Vision Farm Farmtotable Why Hydroponic Our Process People Greens Crisp Fusion Smooth Spice Recipes Markets Grocery Restaurants Hospitality Schools Food Service Locate Support Community News Contact Contact Us Employment Our Process Lef greens are delicious for a reason They’re fresh they’re healthy and they’re locally grown A lot goes into each box of our greens which is why a lot of flavor comes out Before that flavor bursts onto your plate these greens go through a revolutionary and technically advanced journey unlike any other We’d like to give you a peek inside Click a topic below to learn more 1 Seeding 2 Germination 3 Growing 4 Harvesting 5 Packaging 6 Cleaning 1 Seeding On our farm every baby leaf starts from a nonGMO seed planted in a soft bed of peat moss It’s here in our growing channels that the perfect combination of peat moss and moisture creates the ideal environment for our seeds to sprout From there they are sent to our specialized seeders that allow us to plant up to fifteen different varieties of lettuces mustards and Asian greens Our specially designed growing channels have air space below the peat moss that allows roots to grow Once seeded the growing channels receive a fine mist and make their way via a network of rubber conveyor belts to the greenhouse where they will be germinated the fun is about to begin 2 Germination Strong seedlings are the foundation for healthy plants and healthy plants mean you have delicious greens When the seedlings are young they need a lot of extra care Their roots have not yet expanded enough to absorb water so we utilize overhead misters and heated floors that provide pure clean water and heat right where these little greens need them We think of it as a spa treatment for plants After two days the seeds are germinated and are ready to be lifted automatically from the lower germination level to the upper growing level where there is lots of natural sunlight to grow our healthy greens 3 Growing Here is where our greens spend the majority of their time They arrive in the upper level of the greenhouse as freshly germinated seedlings moving along a network of fingers that pull the growing channels from one end of the greenhouse to the other This process takes roughly two weeks from seedling to the perfect height for harvest Now ready for harvest the greens in our growing channels are pushed off the growing line onto a rubber conveyor that will bring them to be harvested Seven days a week 365 days a year we are growing and harvesting fresh baby greens with the mission of getting them on your plate within 24 hours of harvest Irrigation Irrigation or watering is the key to our stateoftheart hydroponic system Drip emitters deliver precise amounts of water into the base of each growing channelThrough gravity the water flows across the roots nourishing the young greens This helps us reduce our water needs by providing water right to the roots as compared to overhead methods which apply water to the ground first then the roots Anything the plants don’t use gets collected and reused over again Water and nutrient management is vital in our process Because our system only has to replace water and nutrients that the plants use we reduce our water consumption and nutrient loss by up to 90 We use 110 of the water and nutrients to produce 66 times more baby greens per acre than traditional insoil production Water Filtration Not all water is created equal which is why we use a water filtration system comprised of specialized sand that removes large particles It keeps our water clean from debris allowing us to reuse it many times over And that means even less water usage Heating Cooling and Ventilation One key element to happy greens is a perfect temperature That can be a challenge in the hot summer months and the brutal winters of New England so we utilize several key systems to help maintain the balance In the summer cooling pads help create the ideal growing environment in our greenhouse And during winter months we use highefficiency natural gas boilers to generate heat Regardless of the time of year our greenhouse stays at a comfortable 75F Air movement becomes particularly important in regulating temperature We vent through the center of the greenhouse allowing us to draw filtered air in through the sides of our facility and push hot air out the top This allows us to keep the greenhouse evenly ventilated no matter what month it is Carbon Dioxide Carbon Dioxide is a requirement for plant growth In the winter months when we’re preserving as much heat as possible our greenhouse ventilates less frequently Overtime the C02 levels drop resulting in lower yields The good news is in the winter months we use our 97 efficient natural gas boilers to heat With a specialized machine we can collect CO2 emissions and disperse them in the greenhouses right where the plants need them Using permeable translucent tubes under the growing areas the plants have access to the C02 needed to grow By capturing and reusing our own emissions we reduce our carbon footprint while creating a perfect growing environment Technology at its best a winwin for the farm and our environment Supplemental Lighting Growing in greenhouses allows us to generate huge amounts of heat and naturally capture about 80 of light from the sun Most months of the year this does the trick However in the winter months when light levels drop we utilize supplemental lighting The goal is to provide just the right amount of light to have healthy plants With advancements in lighting technology we can save energy and produce more light for our greens so they taste as good in the winter as they do in the summer 4 Harvesting The twoweek growing journey is complete and it’s time for harvest Once our baby greens are ready to harvest our growing channels move from the growing lines onto a conveyor belt and right into our stateoftheart cooler By harvesting our greens at a chilly 35°F we rapidly remove heat and lock in the fresh taste increasing postharvest performance extending shelf life and preserving the deliciousness Conveyor belts can be made out of a variety of materials These can include thermoplastics metal rubber fabric and leather The most popular material is a rubber composite because it is flexible resistant smooth and seamless To learn more about conveyor belts go to californiaindustrialrubbernet Once in the cooler our greens are sent through our handsfree harvesting machine It uses a doubleblade system to cut the product at the perfect height From here the greens are gently moved from one conveyor to the next until they reach the mixing lines This is where the magic of our unique blends begins to take shape Each batch stops and waits a specific amount of time before dropping to create a delicate layer of greens so each bag you open has a precise blend inside From here the greens move up a conveyor to a scale where they are weighed and accurately portioned out for each bag If you don’t see terms like “washed and cleaned” or “triplewashed” it’s because our baby greens are protected from field contaminants such as dirt insects manures or harmful pesticides 5 Packaging Once the greens are harvested they’re ready to be placed inside our distinctively branded packages The greens are weighed for food service or retail We use special scales that collect the greens into dozen or more buckets – once a batch reaches the correct weight it is dropped below and immediately sealed for freshness Packages then get dropped into our custommade boxes which use less cardboard and allow for increased airflow This allows our product to maintain the cold chain after harvest keeping our product tasty and fresh up to seven days longer than Californiagrown greens The final step is our quality check which includes a full scan of every package of fresh greens This ensures that before a single package leaves our facility its weight is accurate But more importantly the scan makes sure each package is 100 clean and free of debris Nothing but fresh baby greens inside We also verify the labeling by inspecting the lot number and name of product as well as the weight and the seal This is our commitment to the customer we do the checking so they don’t have to 6 Food Safety Sanitary cleaning practices are at the core of every foodsafe farm While most farms struggle with the ability to keep things consistently clean at lef we take cleaning very seriously We have a unique opportunity to provide a safe and healthy environment for our greens to grow throughout every step of our process Once the roots and growing media have been removed from the growing channel the byproducts are sent to our composting area where we have the potential to compost our waste and repurpose it Better than a landfill isn’t it Each growing channel that grew the last batch of greens is pressure washed and sent back cleaned and ready for the next fresh batch of seeds and growing media Our commitment to clean doesn’t stop there we also thoroughly clean our greenhouse and harvesting room daily From top to bottom we are committed to your safety by keeping our facility rigorously clean and sanitized Greens A simple blend of soft and crunchy green and red baby lettuce A delicious new mix that combines a unique flavor with a slightly crunchier texture profile you can’t find anywhere else For those who want a little more punch than the classic Spring mix this is it very few mouthwatering salads start with a sevenday road trip fresh lettuce grown in another time zone isn’t fresh lettuce fresh should be measured with a stopwatch not a calendar would you call weekold lettuce fresh neither would we vintage yesterday decidedly not aged to perfection Did you know that more than 95 of the greens most people eat come all the way from California Arizona and Mexico That’s not exactly nearby nor is it a recipe for freshness Even many socalled “local” greens are really West Coastgrown — they just get new packaging slapped on at an East Coast repacking operation After they’ve taken a long ride in the back of a shipping truck We think greens need to be grown where they’ll be eaten so they hit your plate at the peak of freshness That’s why all lef greens are hydroponically grown right here in the heart of New England They’ll get to you within 24 quick hours of being harvested And they’ll change your perception of just how fresh healthy and flavorful local greens can actually be CLICK TO CALL Newsletter Signup Sign up for all the delicious lettuce news like us lēf Farms © 2021 lēf Farms Fresh

helpful Helpful Report abuse Keep Smiling 50 out of 5 stars I wouldnt dream of using anything else Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2017 Colour Name Black Size Name 32GB Style Name UHSI CARD ONLY Verified Purchase Ive used SanDisk SDHC cards for ages and always found them to be reliable famous last words and the Extreme Pro cards speed makes it ideal for fast burst photography and 4K video I only ever use 32GB cards I have half a dozen of them because although their content is regularly backed up to memory sticks or hard drives Id rather risk losing only that amount of data than that on one of the larger capacity cards I cant even begin to imagine what Id do if a 512GB card crashed Two 32GB cards work out slightly cheaper per gigabyte than one 64GB too 59p compared to 61p However it has to be admitted that the larger cards beat them both on price the 512GB card is around 46p per gigabyte Read more 81 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse R 50 out of 5 stars A solid card Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2019 Colour Name Black Size Name 64GB Style Name UHSI CARD ONLY Verified Purchase Ive always opted for SanDisk Extreme Pro SD cards because Ive found they provide me exactly what I need for my camera Pros 1 Good writing speed for photography and uploading to PC 2 Enough storage size for a good price 3 I feel safer using this card it seems based on my experience with other brands that theres a lower chance of SanDisk Extreme Pro cards malfunctioning 4 It also looks nice I dont know if this is something people care about but I like it Cons 1 I cant comment on tech support as I havent had to use it 2 Writing speed not 170MBs so the described speed actually refers to the read speed but if you want speeds like this you have to be willing to pay loads more no matter the brand Write speed is still fast enough for all the photos and videos Ive ever had to shoot Read more 50 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse Ben23 20

image files are either absent or they start off present and then disappear from the folders or cant be read Fortunately the files are actually still there and by putting the card back in the camera and downloading over USB I was able to read them But because of this I dont 100 trust them and will only use them in my G9 with an Extreme card in the second slot as backup These cards have also had issues with some Sony cameras see other reviews which leads me to believe there is a particular problem with the ones designated 170MBs I have confirmed that the cards have their stated capacity using the F3 program and I dont believe theyre fake I also bought them direct from Amazon not from a Marketplace seller I have always used Sandisk cards because they have always been reliable but they seem to have dropped the ball on these ones perhaps by bending the UHSI standard a little too much in the pursuit of a higher headline read speed which you will never see in a standard card reader anyway

49,HTML New Jersey to host the worlds largest vertical farm — Born to Engineer documentdocumentElementclassName js Born to Engineer Born to Engineer Engineering News Resources Films Our Mission Routes into Engineering New Jersey to host the world’s largest vertical farm Home » News » Engineering News » New Jersey to host the world’s largest vertical farm New Jersey is all set to become home to the world’s largest vertical farm later this year AeroFarms a USbased startup has just unveiled plans to set up its HQ in Newark later this year The plan is to create a vertical farm within a huge 70000squarefoot steel mill This new farm will be located less than half a mile from it existing farm but is intended to output larger volume of crops The farm will work by stacking racks of crops up to 80 foot high inside the space AeroFarms expect that this will allow them to produce 2 million pounds of greens each year There are many advantages to vertical farming on this scale Not only do yields increase but the ‘farmers’ will have an exceptional level of control over the environment in which the plants are grown By using an automated system of low power LED lighting arrays they can tailor growing techniques to improve flavour and texture as well as allowing them to raise the plants in a completely pesticide free system AeroFarms believe that this could allow them to produce around 75 times as much produce as an equivalent sized field farm The initial crops are set to include kale mizuna arugula rocket and watercress Each receiving their nutrients not from soil but from a mist that is sprayed directly onto the greens while they sit on a reusable cloth sheet created from recycled plastics This cutting edge system is set to use 40 less water than traditional hydroponic systems and a whopping 95 less than field farming While the farm was due to open in late 2015 delays have pushed the launch date back until later this year When it opens it will be the largest indoor vertical farm in the world However with a boom in interest in the field of vertical farming it might not be the largest for long Projects in the UK are looking at converting old WW2 tunnels to indoor farms in Germany a company has announced plans for minifarms inside supermarkets and in the Netherlands plans have been made to incorporate vertical farms into towns so residents can source their organic food As energy demands grown and water resources become more precious these types of solutions could revolution our use of urban spaces to remove the huge distances between field and store for

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Whatsapp Email Link Column 06 November 2020 • Reading time 7 9 minutes Dear David Attenborough beautiful Netflix documentary But your ‘solutions’ destroy nature even more Thomas Oudman Food correspondent for De Correspodent Dear Sir David Attenborough I recently saw your new film A Life on Our Planet – a beautiful harrowing documentary about the global decline of our natural ecosystems It’s a bitter pill with a sweet dessert a possible way out of this mess I couldn’t help but choke on that dessert – because you suddenly mention the Netherlands as a leading example for the rest of the world As a Dutch person this would be a great honour if it weren’t for the fact that you are gravely mistaken Your reasoning is as follows We humans are cultivating more and more land for agriculture to support our growing global population thereby destroying natural ecosystems The most important example is a seemingly endless succession of palm oil plantations in Borneo built at the expense of the richest nature on Earth including orangutans our siblings in the canopy So you say we need to focus all our energies on cultivating more food on less land “The Dutch have become experts at getting the most out of every hectare” we hear you say with your familiar eloquent tone “Despite its size the Netherlands is now the world’s second largest exporter of food” According to you the Netherlands has increased its production tenfold while using fewer pesticides and artificial fertilisers with lower CO2 emissions We see tomatoes growing in futuristic greenhouses and even vertical farming heads of lettuce growing one above the other 10 storeys high illuminated by purple LED lighting But the fact that we are champion exporters is not because we pile heads of lettuce on top of each other or because we grow sustainable scifi tomatoes The “food product” that makes us champion exporters doesn’t taste good it’s flowers We are actually focusing all our energies on supplying the growing global population with flowers That requires heaps of artificial fertiliser Read ‘The most important invention of the 20th century keeps us alive but is killing the environment The solution Eat less meat’ and CO2 And thanks to horticultural exports the Netherlands uses the largest amount of pesticides per hectare in all of Europe If we don’t count flowers the Netherlands isn’t the second largest exporter of food Germany is The fact that you do include flowers is probably because you got your information from an oftencited article Read it here in National Geographic which makes the same mistakes Even so we do export a lot of food so this isn’t the most important fact you missed The point is the Netherlands is cheating We have two tricks that allow us to export so much food with so little land use And as a Dutch ecologist I’m afraid to say they have nothing much to do with the conservation of biodiversity Trick 1 imports The first trick 30 of our exports aren’t actually grown in the Netherlands In fact we import them first This is known as “reexportation” And the Netherlands may be fertile but many of the raw materials for the other 70 also come from abroad For its own consumption alone the Netherlands uses two and a half times more agricultural land than the country possesses That’s not because we pile crops on top of each other in towers that land is situated in other countries Guess where all that palm oil from Borneo goes The Netherlands After India and China the Netherlands was the biggest palm oil importer in 2019 Unilever one of the world’s biggest food multinationals uses this palm oil to make supermarket products for the whole of Europe in Dutch factories Unilever puts oil in practically everything from bread and peanut butter to shampoo and mascara And palm oil is the cheapest oil on the global market Even in formula for babies milk fat is replaced by palm oil All that processed food that would be number four in the list of Dutch export products This year too Unilever was involved in further deforestation in Indonesia Read on Greenpeace ‘Burning down the House How Unilever and other global brands continue to fuel Indonesia’s fires’ Trick 2 fossil fuels The second trick is fossil fuels Although there is a much higher yield per square metre of agricultural land than 50 years ago the efficiency of the production process has collapsed In 1950 every 100 joules of fossil fuels that Dutch farmers used yielded 107 joules of nutritional value thanks to ecological processes but nowadays that ratio is only 100 joules of fossil fuels to 6 joules of nutritional value All that energy goes towards the production of artificial fertiliser building barns driving tractors and transporting all the food And we don’t eat the bulk of it ourselves it’s feed for livestock We use twothirds of all agricultural land to grow grass to feed for our cows They get a supplementary 1020 in the form of protein concentrates the majority of which come from outside Europe soy and palm kernel shells This brings us to our second and third largest agricultural export after flowers meat and dairy Cheap pork and milk for Germany and the UK As an ecologist it hurts me gravely to see that the nature around me is in steady decline I don’t have to tell you about the disastrous effects of bioindustry on the climate and biodiversity you talk about this in your documentary Thanks to all the cheese and cutlets the Netherlands is also a leader when it comes to biodiversity loss As an ecologist it hurts me gravely to see that the nature around me is in steady decline In the last century meadows were a major source of Dutch pride housing many kinds of wild plants and insects and amazing population densities of breeding meadow birds Thanks to agricultural nitrogen pollution and monocultures we have only retained 15 of our original biodiversity If this continues in the same vein it spells the end for our most iconic meadow bird the blacktailed godwit The common snipe redshank and ruff once so common now barely breed in the Netherlands anymore If left to us those birds would be extinct Increasing food production in itself doesn’t reduce the number of undernourished people globally but merely leads to more lower quality products at throwaway prices and an increased consumption of luxury products by people who already had more than enough to eat Read on EuroNews ‘Europeans eat twice as much meat as the global average’ The bulk of Dutch exports goes to other European countries all of which also consume more meat and dairy than is good for them The problem with greenhouse horticulture And now we finally get to the tomato greenhouses Our fifthlargest agricultural export after flowers meat dairy and processed goods is vegetables About half of the export value of fruit and vegetables comes from greenhouse horticulture and that accounts for only 4 of our total agricultural exports Most of this also goes to other European countries You rightly point out that greenhouse horticulture is becoming more and more sustainable when it comes to the use of pesticides water and fertilisers This is encouraging but unfortunately greenhouses are expensive to build and they are by far the most energyintensive sector in the Netherlands much more intensive than the steel industry Greenhouse horticulture takes up 10 of all Dutch natural gas consumption – the same amount as half of all Dutch housing Greenhouse horticulture accounts for 80 of all the energy used for agriculture Economically this is only possible because it is subject to a lower energy tax rate Why do greenhouses get a reduced rate Because otherwise they’d have to pay an enormous amount of energy tax There’s no point even talking about vertical farming because that requires even more energy and it can’t be switched off LED lighting is relatively economical although it has nothing on sunlight which is free but that’s merely promotional chatter Its benefits are instantly negated by the number of lamps enormous dehumidifiers and air conditioners these constructions require A world full of wind turbines – why not If you want to feed the global population with tomatoes and lettuce from greenhouses and vertical farms without fossil fuels then the world would have to be full of wind turbines Maybe you already knew this because that’s exactly what we see in your vision of the future a Sahara full of solar panels and endless grassy plains with ambling herds of wildlife grazing under the swish of wind turbines The Lion King goes 21st century You mention population growth which is mainly taking place in Africa as the leading cause of increasing food consumption But what about ourselves the enormous and everincreasing consumption per person in western countries On average Europeans consume seven times as much energy and six times as much meat Read more about worldwide meat consumption here as Africans and both numbers keep rising I was hoping that we had by now moved on from a time when Europe shifted the responsibility for its problems on to Africa In Africa too energy consumption is rising meat consumption is barely increasing in fact it is declining in a number of countries but I was hoping that we had by now moved on from a time when Europe shifted the responsibility for its problems on to Africa Even if the African population and the average consumption per African doubled they would still be below our levels of consumption Why would we point at them and not at ourselves And why do you situate these energy parks in two of the world’s biggest largely intact natural ecosystems You say it would help nature but I can’t figure out how Simba would profit from wind turbines We need naturefriendly agriculture Dear Sir David Attenborough very few voices are heard as widely as yours By praising Dutch exports you are only repeating our food industry’s marketing slogans Please stop Argue for hard measures to curb our own consumption Hold food giants like Unilever to account Condemn agriculture that comes at the expense of biodiversity Not only in Borneo but also in the Netherlands and on your own island of Britain If Europe were to make it part of its policy to halve meat and dairy production in favour of seasonal vegetables we would be able to manage without exports from outside Europe while promoting healthier living and environmentally friendly farming And the European Union has that power because it has been determining farmers’ choices for decades with a cash injection that constitutes almost 40 percent of the total EU budget It’s a choice Without Dutch imports and exports the world outside Europe would not have less but more to eat and not less but more nature would be preserved And with wild flowers and birds in our meadows we would no longer need to cut flowers to remind us of the beauty of nature That’s not a utopian vision There are still farmers in the Netherlands who show us that it is possible You are 94 now I hope you live a long life but we need to hurry up and make sure we can manage without new David Attenborough films in

on this site Abstract Full Text InfoHistory Metrics DataCode Preview PDF Abstract In order to design actionable SARSCoV2 strategies we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified isolation levels for healthy 60 and vulnerable individuals At first we forced isolation levels to be uniform showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro33 In the process we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns Regardless of the infectiousness period we realized that is possible to infer nonuniform isolation levels for healthy 60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the 60 to 60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values we argue immunity level estimations made in this way Madrid 41 Catalonia 23 Brussels 49 and Stockholm 62 are closer to reality In locations where we didn’t find reliable serology we performed immunity estimations assuming Spain’s serology ratio Paris 23 London 33 We predict that no location can return to normal life without having a second wave albeit in Stockholm a smaller one We searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths shockingly all found isolations for healthy 60 were negative ie coronavirus parties minimize final deaths Then assuming an ideal 1day long vaccination campaign with a 77 efficacy vaccine we compared predicted final deaths of those 90day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 040 mandatory isolation to healthy 60 and results in 065 isolation to vulnerable We found that 180day of mandatory isolations to healthy 60 ie schools and workplaces closed produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than Madrid Feb 23 2021 Catalonia Dec 28 2020 Brussels Apr 25 2021 Paris Jan 14 2021 London Jan 22 2021 We also modeled how average isolation levels change the probability of getting infected for a single individual that isolates differently than average That led us to realize disease damages to third parties due to virus spreading can be calculated and to postulate that an individual has the right to avoid mandatory isolation during epidemics SARSCoV2 or any other if these damages can be covered with a novel proposed isolation exemption insurance policy As secondary findings in Appendix III we hypothesize that an early D614 like strain wave might be the cause of low mortality in Asia and show the negligible reduction of HIT due to heterogeneity Finally we conclude that our 2stratum SEIRS model is suitable to predict SARSCoV2 epidemic behavior and can be used to minimize covid19 disease and isolations related damages To the sole effect of understanding and verifying its

they were a show of Nazi propaganda stirring significant conflict Despite the exclusionary principles of the 1936 Games countries around the world still agreed to participate Key Facts 1 Nazi Germany used the 1936 Olympic Games for propaganda purposes The Nazis promoted an image of a new strong and united Germany while masking the regime’s targeting of Jews and Roma Gypsies as well as Germany’s growing militarism 2 For the first time in the history of the modern Olympic Games people in the United States and Europe called for a boycott of the Olympics because of what would later become known as human rights abuses Although the movement ultimately failed it set an important precedent for future Olympic boycott campaigns such as those in 2008 and 2014 3 Once the boycott movement narrowly failed Germany had its propaganda coup the 49 nations who sent teams to the Games legitimized the Hitler regime both in the eyes of the world and of German domestic audiences More information about

Ελληνικά فارسی Magyar Bahasa Indonesia Italiano 日本語 한국어 Português do Brasil русский Türkçe اُردو 简体中文 Español Français Introduction The Nazi Olympics Berlin 1936 For two weeks in August 1936 Adolf Hitler s Nazi dictatorship camouflaged its racist militaristic character while hosting the Summer Olympics Softpedaling its antisemitic agenda and plans for territorial expansion the regime exploited the Games to bedazzle many foreign spectators and journalists with an image of a peaceful tolerant Germany Having rejected a proposed boycott of the 1936 Olympics the sponsoring athletic and Olympic organizations of the United States and other western democracies missed the opportunity to take a stand that—some observers at the time claimed—might have given Hitler pause and bolstered international resistance to Nazi tyranny With the conclusion of the Games Germanys expansionist policies and the persecution of Jews and other enemies of the state accelerated culminating in World War II and the Holocaust The 1936 Summer Olympic Games In 1931 the International Olympic Committee awarded the 1936 Summer Olympics to Berlin The choice signaled Germanys return to the world community after its isolation in the aftermath of defeat in World War I Two years later Nazi party leader Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany and quickly turned the nations fragile democracy into a oneparty dictatorship that persecuted Jews Roma Gypsies all political opponents and others The Nazi claim to control all aspects of German life also extended to sports German sports imagery of the 1930s served to promote the myth of “Aryan” racial superiority and physical prowess In sculpture and in other forms German artists idealized athletes welldeveloped muscle tone and heroic strength and accentuated ostensibly Aryan facial features Such imagery also reflected the importance the Nazi regime placed on physical fitness a prerequisite for military service Exclusion from German Sports In April 1933 an Aryans only policy was instituted in all German athletic organizations NonAryans—Jews or individuals with Jewish parents and Roma Gypsies—were systematically excluded from German sports facilities and associations The German Boxing Association expelled professional light heavyweightchampion Erich Seelig in April 1933 because he was Jewish Seelig later resumed his boxing career in the United States Another Jewish athlete Daniel Prenn—Germanys topranked tennis player—was removed from Germanys Davis Cup Team Gretel Bergmann a worldclass high jumper was expelled from her German club in 1933 and from the German Olympic team in 1936 Jewish athletes barred from German sports clubs flocked to separate Jewish associations including the Maccabee and Shield groups and to improvised segregated facilities But these Jewish sports facilities were not comparable to wellfunded German groups Roma Gypsies including the Sinti boxer Johann Rukelie Trollmann were also excluded from German sports Jewish Athletes As a token gesture to placate international opinion German authorities allowed the star fencer Helene Mayer to represent Germany at the Olympic Games in Berlin Mayer was viewed as a “nonAryan” because her father was Jewish She won a silver medal in womens individual fencing and like all other medalists for Germany gave the Nazi salute on the podium No other Jewish athlete competed for Germany in the Summer Games Still nine athletes who were Jewish or of Jewish parentage won medals in the Nazi Olympics including Mayer and five Hungarians Seven Jewish male athletes from the United States went to Berlin Like some of the European Jewish competitors at the Olympics many of these young men were pressured by Jewish organizations to boycott the Games These athletes chose to compete for a variety of reasons Most did not fully grasp at the time the extent and purpose of Nazi persecution of Jews and other groups In August 1936 the Nazi regime tried to camouflage its violent racist policies while it hosted the Summer Olympics Most antiJewish signs were temporarily removed and newspapers toned down their harsh rhetoric in line with directives from the Propaganda Ministry headed by Joseph Goebbels Thus the regime exploited the Olympic Games to present foreign spectators and journalists with a false image of a peaceful tolerant Germany Boycott Movements Movements to boycott the 1936 Berlin Olympics surfaced in the United States Great Britain France Sweden Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands Debate over participation in the 1936 Olympics was most intense in the United States which traditionally sent one of the largest teams to the Games Some boycott proponents supported counterOlympics One of the largest was the Peoples Olympiad planned for the summer of 1936 in Barcelona Spain It was canceled after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 just as thousands of athletes had begun to arrive Individual Jewish athletes from a number of countries also chose to boycott the Berlin Olympics or Olympic qualifying trials In the United States some Jewish athletes and Jewish organizations such as the American Jewish Congress and the Jewish Labor Committee supported a boycott as did a number of liberal Catholic politicians and many college presidents However once the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States opted in a close vote to participate in December 1935 other countries fell in line and the boycott movement failed Preparation for the Games The Nazis made elaborate preparations for the August 1–16 Summer Games A huge sports complex was constructed including a new stadium and stateofthe art Olympic village for housing the athletes Olympic flags and swastikas bedecked the monuments and houses of a festive crowded Berlin Most tourists were unaware that the Nazi regime had temporarily removed antiJewish signs nor would they have known of a police roundup of Roma in Berlin ordered by the German Ministry of the Interior On July 16 1936 some 800 Roma residing in Berlin and its environs were arrested and interned under police guard in a special camp in the Berlin suburb of Marzahn Nazi officials also ordered that foreign visitors should not be subjected to the criminal penalties of German antihomosexuality laws Opening of the Games On August 1 1936 Hitler opened the XIth Olympiad Musical fanfares directed by the famous composer Richard Strauss announced the dictators arrival to the largely German crowd Hundreds of athletes in opening day regalia marched into the stadium team by team in alphabetical order Inaugurating a new Olympic ritual a lone runner arrived bearing a torch carried by relay from the site of the ancient Games in Olympia Greece Fortynine athletic teams from around the world competed in the Berlin Olympics more than in any previous Olympics Germany fielded the largest team with 348 athletes The US team was the second largest with 312 members including 18 African Americans American Olympic Committee President Avery Brundage led the delegation The Soviet Union did not participate in the Berlin Games or any Olympics until the 1952 Helskinki Games when many politicians journalists and competitors regarded the Olympics as an important battle in the Cold War Propaganda Germany skillfully promoted the Olympics with colorful posters and magazine spreads Athletic imagery drew a link between Nazi Germany and ancient Greece symbolizing the Nazi racial myth that a superior German civilization was the rightful heir of an Aryan culture of classical antiquity This vision of classical antiquity emphasized ideal Aryan racial types heroic blueeyed blonds with finely chiseled features Concerted propaganda efforts continued well after the Olympics with the international release in 1938 of Olympia the controversial documentary directed by German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl Renowned for her earlier propaganda film Triumph of the Will 1934 depicting Nazi Party rallies at Nuremberg Riefenstahl was commissioned by the Nazi regime to produce this film about the 1936 Summer Games German Victories Germany emerged victorious from the XIth Olympiad German athletes captured the most medals and German hospitality and organization won the praises of visitors Most newspaper accounts echoed the New York Times report that the Games put Germans back in the fold of nations and even made them more human again Some even found reason to hope that this peaceable interlude would endure Only a few reporters such as the American William Shirer understood that the Berlin glitter was merely a facade hiding a racist and oppressively violent regime After the Games As postGames reports were filed Hitler pressed on with grandiose plans for German expansion Persecution of Jews resumed Two days after the Olympics Captain Wolfgang Fuerstner head of the Olympic village killed himself when he was dismissed from military service because of his Jewish ancestry Germany invaded Poland on September 1 1939 Within just three years of the Olympiad the hospitable and peaceable sponsor of the Games unleashed World War II a conflict that resulted in untold destruction With the conclusion of the Games Germanys expansionist policies and the persecution of Jews and other enemies of the state accelerated culminating in the Holocaust Authors United

reviews Most recent Top reviews Top reviews from United Kingdom There was a problem filtering reviews right now Please try again later HD 50 out of 5 stars Fairly good image stabiliser Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2017 Verified Purchase This is my first 4kUHD camcorder so my expectations are high I bought it as an openedbox ‘as new’ item from Amazon Warehouse deals Initially I was a bit dubious about this but backed by Amazon’s 30 days moneyback guarantee I took the plunge to give it a go Actually it turned out to be all right not quite sure why the previous buyer returned it But anyway back to the machine itself This was Sony’s flagship prosumer camcorder until the 2nd half of 2017 when they released the upgraded version of 700E which in my opinion isn’t really worth the price tag considering the extra premium you pay Pros True 4k imagine capturing when footage played back on UHD TV the quality is mind blowing Fairly good image stabiliser if not mistaken it’s optical The supplied battery delivers usable time in real world Dual format allows you to record the main 4k footage and a 720p mp4 reference file simultaneously And I agree with all other good points mentioned by other reviewers on Amazon UK Cons from my own experience after 8 months use Slow auto focusing the machine struggles a bit to hunt the correct focus in low light and sometimes even in bright situations You may wish to quickly switch to manual focus to save time The menu system is clunky yet confusing in some aspects Only stereo sound capturing in 4k recording modes The machine is noticeably slower in 4k recording modes than it is in full HD or lowerres modes EuropeanPAL model ie AX 100E can record either 24p or 25p in 4k which in my opinion isn’t fast enough for fast panning shots or actions So expect ‘jitter’ on playback especially on big screens Someone may like this ‘film look’ though while others may not NB The upgraded 700E has the same frame rate on paper The recent stock of this camcorder should be shipped with the latest firmware which has improved autofocusing algorithm and 100Mbps 4k recording mode So it’s worth checking that first if not then you can easily download and install the latest firmware from Sony website Full instructions are provided there Read more 13 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse Mr A PICKUP 50 out of 5 stars Absolutely delighted Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 September 2020 Verified Purchase I use a Fuji system but bought this for videos the Fuji ones are OK iPhone OK thats all I got this yesterday so tried it out today and reluctant as I was left my proper still equipment at home 1 I had only read a little of the manual but coped well enough without Couldnt change aperture so that is the first thing to look up 2 I didnt expect to take any stills but I needed one of a new building which is being developed I run a local website The photos are excellent though I wish it did RAW or DNG Good enough though I took dozens of still photos mostly of the ground as my finger kept hitting the button It takes a few seconds to save them too 20Mp is only available with 4K video enabled 3 The video is fantastic both 4K and the one below What was most impressive though was the sound quality I am a heavy breather dont ask but it didnt pick up the sound at all unlike my other cameras I also heard conversations I didnt even know had taken place 4 Autofocus is slow but when it has got it it maintains it as it follows the subject movement 5 I wish I had taken a monopod So I pondered about buying this but after a couple of hours use I have no regrets at all It will be even better when ive learned to use it properly Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report abuse Mr Gordon Joslin 50 out of 5 stars An Image quality Video Camera Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 June 2019 Verified Purchase An excellent video camera producing quality results in a Landscape Format Digital skill is required to make manual adjustments and changing setting A theme needs planning and settings set before recording and not during shooting as self inflicted video faults can occur Digital stills are excellent and suitable for large format printing Dynamic range is very good but thought needs to be given to lighting conditions of the subject to ensure there are no hot spots where highlights could be burned out Details in highlights excellent when care in composition is taken I would like to have a Portait format available for I enjoy shooting Portraits Play memories software excellent As the end image and composition is usually very good I have little need for editing Check the Composition Avoid Highlights and if Manual get the settings right before recording I prefer a Sony Video Camera

Kingdom on 29 April 2019 Style Name Camcorder Verified Purchase FDRAX53 failed with major data error after normal use over a 33 month period According to Amazon this is ‘beyond the expected life of the product’ Amazon fail to recognise UK consumer rights law and fob me off with advice to contact Sony about the faulty product If 33 months is ‘beyond the expected life’ for a £750 consumer

5 stars This is a little annoying but as Im not using the camera for professional Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2017 Style Name Camcorder Verified Purchase The only negative about this camera is its only really got semi auto control priority shooting so you cant set all the components of exposure manually This is locked in software to obviously make you spend an extra £1000 on the AX100 or the new AX700 This is a little annoying but as Im not using the camera for professional shooting or paid work i can deal with this The auto settings do a good job and I tend to use the camera on the move so manual exposure tweaking often isnt practical Other than that the picture quality is clear noise is low even at higher gain settings and the stabiliser is second to none You also get 35mm mic input which I use for a rode videomicro headphone jack and evf I love the ability to setup manual focus using the front focus ring I use manaul focus with the focus peaking turned on more than I thought I would Not because the auto focus is bad but because the ring is so easy and lets you fix a focus point quickly Used to its full potential this camera can create great quality video

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2018 Style Name Camcorder Verified Purchase OMG I am a video editor and a fairly decent camera operative and this camera treats me like a total idiot which zero idea of where I like to stop a pan to Meaning the 5 axis balance is insane I am sure its great where you are jogging to keep up with your subject but when you have a steady hand as I do deliberately stop somewhere on a handheld pan and the confounded thing keeps rocking as though your decisions are not good enough No I wasnt going too fast Yes it went back Saved myself nearly £160 and got an equivalent Panasonic Otherwise nicely weighted in the hand I am used to the Panasonic HVX200 but also had an old much smaller Sony camcorder for discreet work for my liking Build quality was OK with enough metal to make me think it wasnt just a toy Inconvenient that it doesnt come with a mains lead and a battery charger Battery life is never going to be adequate for me and I like the ability to plug into the mains if a shoot runs over or at VERY least charge the second battery Writing of metal The other thing which got to me is that when I received it the lens cover was open and the outer rings edge is very sharp metal and had shaved the stupid nonwoven packaging And with the lens exposed that allowed the lens to be covered in shavings Id have had to have cleaned the lens before I could have used it if I had kept it Read more 15 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse Christopher H 50 out of 5 stars The only thing I would recommend is a large memory card there isnt one included Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2017 Style Name Camcorder Verified Purchase This is a very full featured camera considering the size which doesnt sit much above your average family vacation camcorder size providing youre not a time traveller from the 90s The features and operation are immediately apparent to anyone who has operated a handicam and most people will be able to get up and filming in no time However its where you start to dive into the features of the camera that you find yourself pleasantly surprised The wheel at the front can be used to tweak any number of things such as focal range magnifier included AE balance and contrast This combined with a quality zoom really helps give you control over the look of your shots The steadicam gyroscope is also extremely handy when trying to capture a moving shot without rigid dolly or tripod stiffness The only thing I would recommend is a large memory card there isnt one included The video files easily creep into the GB range Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse G N thompson 50 out of 5 stars Pleased with my purchase Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 August 2018 Style Name Camcorder Verified Purchase I have been using the ax53 for sometme now I find it simple to use and with the best quality video I have seen it is well made and has the feel of a professional camera I strongly advise using nd filters with the camera for perfect video the steady shot is fantastic and the zoom gives good quality even at full zoom you can set your own settings and use this in full manual with Manual focus or exposure but in full auto mode the results are pretty much faultless I use manual shutter speed with nd filter or polariser pop it into sunny on wb and that’s about it the results are amazing the microphone is very good but you can always use a shotgun mic or other with the mic input on the camcorder it’s an all round perfect camcorder that can be used by anyone also by the professional Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse Daniel Davinci TOP 500 REVIEWER 40 out of 5 stars Great but DARK Stills in full light Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2019 Style Name Camcorder Verified Purchase This camcorder is a great build it really feels like quality The LED is bright and vibrant and the res is enough to do its job I wasnt sure I like the wobble inside due to the stabilizer but this is something Ive gotten used to I was very impressed by the quality of the 4K videos which I took on the beach Previous to that I had only taken videos indoors to good effect It brightens up dark videos quite nicely however when it comes to still photographs even with full direct studio lighting with LEDs the result is a dull image I cant seem to figure this out so appreciate any advice I cant see any option to fix this in the menu I always have to edit the photo on the computer Otherwise recommended Read more 2 people found this helpful

When we brought out the DD H2Ocean Pro reef salt a few years ago we were adamant that we wanted to print the exact levels and tolerances for the main important elements that we would expect to find in our salt on every bucket information that should be readily available to allow an informed choice for every good reef salt Of course once we gave people levels to test against we received a steady stream of emails and threads from individuals who were measuring readings outside these guaranteed parameters The main reason that we found for this discrepancy other than general mixing and test kit errors was due to low specific gravity ie not enough salt in their water Further investigation brought to light a number of anomalies and misunderstandings regarding the whole issue of SG and SG measurement and has prompted me to write this article which tries to illustrate some potential problems when using specific gravity as a unit of measurement without a full understanding of what is actually being measured Most people if asked would probably tell you that their reef aquarium is running at an SG Specific Gravity of 1025 Those with greater understanding may go into further detail and tell you that the SG is 1025 at 25C but where does this figure come from and is it the best way to measure or express the amount of salt in your aquarium is it even the correct level to be running at The salinity of the world’s oceans is not constant and varies substantially from one location to the next with concentrations of just 1015ppt in the Baltic Sea to around 40ppt in the Red Sea But stop a minute Why are we talking about Salinity now instead of SG and what is the difference SALINITY Salinity is a true measurement of the concentration of salt in the ocean and is calculated as the total weight of ‘dry’ salt dissolved in a total of 1000 weight units of water or parts per thousand ppt Salinity is a pure weight per weight measurement and as weight is not influenced by temperature then neither is salinity The generally accepted standard salinity for natural seawater NSW is 35ppt It is not possible to measure the salinity of the ocean or your aquarium directly unless you take a precise weight of seawater and evaporate all of the H20 from it then measure the weight of the residue mass solids analysis Obviously this is not a convenient technique for the average hobbyist so we use other methods to determine the salinity indirectly SPECIFIC GRAVITY SG Specific Gravity or relative density is expressed as the ratio of the density of seawater relative to the density of the same volume of pure water This of course can be quantified quite easily however as the density of a liquid is calculated as the weight of a unit volume of that liquid and because liquids expand with temperature then the volume that we measure and subsequently the weight of that volume will also change We should always therefore qualify the SG by quoting it at a specific measured temperature eg 1025 at 25C Many people may have noticed on their hydrometers that there is a temperature quoted on the side normally in small writing This is the temperature at which the hydrometer was designedcalibrated to measure the water sample at – SIMPLES to use the words of a well known Russian meerkat All we need to do is to ensure that our sample water is at that temperature and the specific gravity will be exactly right NOT QUITE TRUE At a simple level this is correct however as you get further into the subject you will find that the SG reading that you obtain may be more specific to the equipment you have chosen to use to measure it rather than to the actual salt concentration in your tank I suspect rightly or wrongly that the specific gravity levels that we as hobbyists use in our aquariums may be historical from general oceanographic studies and it is not immediately clear when or where the 1025 at 25C standard originates from If you trawl the internet and scientific literature you will find that the specific gravity measurements and tables for seawater which you come across were first developed long ago by shipping companies and oceanographic bodies like the NOAA These charts were used to allow a simple way of calculating the changes in seawater density across the various oceans which affects how much cargo a ship can carry on a journey from one destination to another The higher the density or salt content the more cargo the ship can hold without sinking If you go back to the original definition of specific gravity you will see that we calculate the SG as the density of a sample of SEAWATER at a specific temperature divided by the density of PURE WATER at a specific temperature It is with density of the pure water that the problem or potential for error occurs Unfortunately there are a number of different temperature standards commonly used in oceanography and so printed tables for PURE WATER density can be quoted at 4C 60F 1556C 20C or 25C depending on their intended application Each temperature standard will result in a different pure water density figure which will give a different SG when we use that density in our calculation EXAMPLE If we calculate the specific gravity for a sample of 35ppt seawater using a standard density temperature of 25C for the seawater sample but vary the density temperature used for the pure water we can see how this affects the specific gravity result Specific Gravity sT0Tx X 1000 s is the density of 35ppt seawater at temperature T in this case 25C 1023343 0 is the density of pure water at a range of commonly used temperature standards Tx 0 1556C 09990166 SG 102334309990166 102435 0 200C 0998203 SG 10233430998203 102519 0 250C 0997047958 SG 10233430997047958 102637 We can see from the above that by using a pure water temperature standard of 20C that the SG of 35ppt NSW does in fact approximate to 1025 which is perhaps where the figure comes from however you can also see the potential range that becomes available if another standard temperature is used All of these readings are for the same sample of 35ppt seawater at the same sample temperature of 25C To measure the amount of salt in our aquarium by way of an SG reading we must therefore understand which pure water temperature standard and which sample water temperature standard was originally used when calibrating the hydrometer or refractometer which is not constant between all equipment and manufacturers The Tropic Marin High Precision Hydrometer for example quotes 25C25C on the instructions which means that it is calibrated using the density of both the sea water and pure water at 25C With this instrument you should therefore be looking to measure an SG of 10264 and not 1025 for the same 35ppt water sample This brings us back full circle to the point that the salinity scale which we talked about at the start is perhaps a much better way of expressing the salt concentration of your aquarium as we do not have the same potential for variation however most glass hydrometers do not even show this scale DOES IT REALLY MATTER The main drive behind this article was to enlighten people on the potential variation between different specific gravity measurements and to show individuals why they often find varying concentrations of major elements such as calcium and magnesium in their tanks compared with what they ‘expect to find’ or have been ‘told that they should find’ in their salt mix If as a consequence of measurement or calibration technique you do end up with a low salt concentration in your tank or salt mix a salinity of only 33ppt for example You should then equally expect that the concentrations of ‘all’ elements will be low as a consequence compared with the target concentrations found in natural seawater If the normal calcium level of NSW at 35ppt is 420ppm then at 33ppt salinity this will only be 396ppm and if the aquarist is not aware of his low salinity and adds more calcium to raise the level to 420ppm then they will be putting this particular element out of balance with the rest of the salt whilst ignoring other elements that may be just as important for the proper biological function of the organisms we keep What they should really do is to add more ‘salt’ to raise the salinity and bring ‘all’ of the levels up together DD quote figures on the concentrations of the main elements in our H2Ocean salt at 355ppt which is an average of the readings found in the coral seas With our new found understanding of the relationship between salinity and specific gravity we can expect that the 355ppt standard can correctly equate to an SG anywhere between 10247 and 10267 depending on the hydrometer used HYDROMETERS AND REFRACTOMETERS We discussed earlier that as aquarists we do not measure salinity or specific gravity directly and instead measure another parameter which has a relationship with the salt concentration such as refractive index in the case of a refractometer buoyancy in the case of a hydrometer and conductivity if measured electrically Unfortunately all of these alternative parameters ‘are’ affected by temperature and so even when measuring salinity which is not temperature dependant we must still make an allowance because of the indirect test method HYDROMETERS There are various glass and plastic hydrometers available to aquarists on the market which work on the principle of buoyancy where the denser the liquid in which it is immersed the higher it will float The more expensive glass hydrometers are very accurate but time consuming to use as they require a clear sided vessel in which to float and for the water to be at the exact calibration temperature They are extremely delicate and easy to break and generally only display an SG scale which means you need a complete understanding of both the sample calibration temperature required and the pure water calibration standard used to be able to relate the reading back to a particular salinity The cheaper plastic swing arm hydrometers are easy to use and robust but are not always intended to give an absolutely accurate reading and not normally used by more experienced reef keepers housing delicate and expensive stock There can be issues with these units giving false readings over time due to bubbles or deposits attaching to the swing arm or pivot point which change the buoyancy and therefore the reading obtained Swing arm hydrometers normally show a salinity scale and an SG scale but calibration temperatures may vary from one manufacturer to another REFRACTOMETERS Refractometers work on the principle that changes in salt concentration affect the refractive index of light and therefore light entering the instrument is deflected by varying amounts onto a graduated scale They are a convenient fast and easy method of keeping check on the salinity in your aquarium or when mixing up new batches for water changes The majority of refractometers in the hobby are manufactured and calibrated for use with saltwater and not seawater and intended for measuring sodium chloride brine concentrations Although sodium chloride is the main constituent of NSW it varies in refractive index due to the lack of other ions such as calcium and magnesium which are found in seawater The result of these additional elements is that the refractive index changes so that a 35ppt seawater solution approximates to the same refractive index as that of 368ppt brine Whilst this may seem a small difference we should remember that it does have a significant impact on the true concentration of the dissolved elements in our aquariums When using a conventional ‘saltwater’ or ‘brine’ refractometer for the reef aquarium we must therefore look to achieve a reading of 368ppt if our intended salinity is 35ppt or 373ppt if our intended salinity is 355ppt as quoted for the H2Ocean salt CALIBRATION To use a refractometer properly we must first understand the correct calibration procedure If you look down the lens of most good refractometers you will see 2020 printed on the screen This means that it was originally calibrated with both pure water and sample water temperatures set at 20C and so in order to recalibrate the instrument properly you must use the same temperature for your calibration sample What many people do not understand however is that it is the temperature of the instrument that should be at 20C and not the liquid as the few drops of sample water contains so little heat that it soon equilibrates to the same temperature as the refractometer body So with your refractometer at 20C which is close to normal room temperature you add a sample of distilled or RO water to the screen and use the adjustment screw to line up the blue marker with the zero salinity mark This can now be used to measure the sample salinity accurately but only whilst the refractometer is still at 20C Remember that even if your aquarium is running at say 27C 806F the refractometer will always read as if it were at 20C If you have an auto temperature compensating model ATC you must still calibrate the unit at the calibration temperature of 20C however this version once correctly set will auto adjust for environments where the instrument warms or cools away from this temperature Normally the range is 1035C and is achieved by a small bimetallic strip in the body of the refractometer which responds to the change and moves the graduated scale accordingly For this reason copper bodied refractometers are better than the lower cost plastic ones as they conduct the ambient temperature changes faster True seawater refractometers have never really existed in the hobby at an affordable price until now but as part of the development of our salt and salt related products DD have brought out a new model of refractometer which is specifically calibrated to the salinity of NSW thus removing the requirement to apply an offset to obtain the true reading for your aquarium These new models are easily identified as seawater refractometers on the viewing screen and have been produced to show the correct SG of 10266 for NSW at a salinity of 35ppt and a samplepure water density of 20C and a reduced range of salinity from 0 40 rather than 0 – 100 IN CONCLUSION Hydrometers – understand the calibration temperature requirements and take note that SG is not a constant number across all measuring equipment and reference sources Refractometers – understand the calibration requirements and apply an offset to measure the true seawater salinity if using a saltwaterbrine model Understand that the SG scale is not a constant number across all measuring equipment and reference sources Remember that the most important thing for your aquarium is consistency and stability This applies to both the salinity and the relative concentrations of all elements within the salt and so any changes in salinity salt brand or

successfully grown more than 300 types of plants without the help of the sun Photo courtesy of Sananbio XIAO YAN 36kr August 17 2020 0419 JST China Copy Copied BEIJING A Chinese company expects the future of highrise farming to arrive in 2025 Thats when the costs of conventional farming are expected to match those of vertical farming when growing food inside urban towers will be able to address population and environmental issues in a more economical way and when the indoor agriculture market is expected to be worth 99 billion Sananbio is the vertical farm leader in China and the market estimate is from Grand View Research of the US The sector is still getting off the ground but overseas startups have succeeded in raising large amounts of money Sananbio was created in 2015 by the Institute of Plant Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Fujian Sanan Group It inherited the Institute of Plant Researchs plant technology and Fujian Sanans capabilities in optoelectronics a field concerned with the use of electronics and light With these tools it conducts research into biotechnology photobiology indoor agriculture and other areas It currently holds 416 patents nearly 60 of which have been filed with the Patent Cooperation Treaty an international organization that helps patent holders gain international protection for their inventions Sananbio has set up research facilities in Fujian and Anhui provinces and operates large indoor farms in Beijing Shanghai and other major cities In the US state of Nevada it is developing cultivated varieties for the North American market In Singapore it is developing indoor farming technologies for desert and island countries In 2015 Sananbio worked with another research institute to build a 10000 sq meter indoor farm that grows leafy vegetables with artificial light the first such facility in the world Its latest triumph is Uplift a system for unmanned agricultural factories that can create construction plans for factories based on internal layouts so that sowing dividing roots and daily management can be automated The system also can reduce the use of pesticides The company has successfully grown more than 300 types of leafy vegetables fruits herbs edible flowers and medicinal herbs Sananbios business model is to provide hardware and vertical farming solutions to farmers who want to innovate and companies looking to enter agriculture It also provides ongoing technical support Its research facilities in Fujian Anhui and the US already supply technology and globally the company either owns or services 120000 sq meters worth of indoor farms More than 50 indoor agricultural facilities in the US Canada Japan South Korea Singapore the United Arab Emirates the UK Saudi Arabia and Germany use Sananbio facilities Looking ahead the costs associated with conventional farming will match those of vertical farming around 2025 according to Zhan Zhuo Sananbios general manager If this forecast is accurate opportunities for vertical farms to spread quickly would explode Zhan said The company says it is also making progress in other areas such as plantbased bioreactors planters for home use and exhibition indoor farms for educational purposes 36Kr a Chinese tech news portal founded in Beijing in 2010 has more than 150 million readers worldwide Nikkei

concerning the delimitation of frontiers Background science This website allows you to explore how different scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to climate change could change the geography of food insecurity in developing and leastdeveloped countries The website maps an index of vulnerability to food insecurity at national level This is calculated based on exposure to climaterelated hazards sensitivity of agricultural production to those hazards and the capacity of countries to cope with climaterelated food shocks By altering the levels of future global greenhouse gas emissions andor the levels of adaptation you can see how vulnerability to food insecurity changes over time and compare and contrast these different future scenarios with each other and the present day Vulnerability to food insecurity in the presentday The climate and food insecurity index shown on this website is a measure of vulnerability of the food system to climaterelated hazards Vulnerability is calculated at a country level and is comprised of three components Exposure to climaterelated hazards Sensitivity of national agricultural production to climaterelated hazards Adaptive capacity a measure of capacity to cope with climaterelated food shocks Exposure The exposure component of the index is calculated from a measure of the average length of flood and drought events in each country This is constructed from gridded meteorological data for the baseline period 19812010 The exposure is only calculated over areas with a population density greater than 150 people per km2 andor more than 1 of the area given over to crop production Sensitivity The sensitivity component of the index is calculated using indicators relevant to agricultural production These are measures of the amount of forest cover rainfed agriculture and cereal crop yield per country Adaptive capacity The adaptive capacity component of the index is calculated using socioeconomic indicators relevant to the food security system These are measures of rural and urban populations with access to water resources the percentage of rural population population growth rate population below the poverty line 2 per day vulnerable employment government effectiveness and the number of paved roads per country Criteria for inclusion All data included in the vulnerability to food insecurity index correlates with the Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO measure of undernutrition Vulnerability to food insecurity as a result of weather events is most apparent in developing and leastdeveloped countries as they rely more heavily on incountry food production compared to the most developed countries which have access to markets For this reason OECD and EU countries are not included in the calculation Small countries 500 km2 and those with few people andor little or no agricultural production are also not included in the calculation Future projections of vulnerability to food insecurity Future projections of the climate and food insecurity index have been calculated for a range of scenarios of different future global greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation levels Greenhouse gas emission scenarios There are three scenarios of future global greenhouse gas emissions to choose from low intermediate or high emissions These three scenarios correspond to climate model projections of the climate system response to three different greenhouse gas concentration pathways The low emissions scenario represents a rapid and sustained reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions resulting in an increase in global average temperature of around 2Â°C above preindustrial levels by the end of the 21st century This scenario is also known as RCP26 The intermediate emissions scenario represents a modest reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions resulting in an increase in global average temperature of around 25Â°C 3Â°C above preindustrial levels by the end of the 21st century This scenario is also known as RCP45 The high emissions scenario represents considerable future increases in global greenhouse gas emissions resulting in a rise in global average temperature of 4Â°C or more above preindustrial levels by the end of the 21st century This scenario is also known as RCP85 The climate model projections are used to calculate future projections of the exposure component of the index Twelve climate models from the latest generation of climate models used to inform the most recent InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change report IPCC AR5 were used and the average value of the index for each country across the models is shown Information about the model spread of the results Scenarios of adaptation investment There are three scenarios of different adaptation levels to choose from high low or no adaptation The scenarios determine how sensitive agricultural production is to climaterelated hazards and the capacity to cope with climaterelated food shocks in the future Applying an adaptation scenario changes the sensitivity and adaptive capacity components of the index The level of change follows standardised scenarios and the change was scaled to allow the most vulnerable countries to improve most relative to the presentday and the least vulnerable countries to change the least The âhighâ adaptation scenario corresponds to a change of approximately 1015 in the 2050s compared to the presentday and a further change of approximately 1015 in the 2080s compared to the 2050s The âlowâ adaptation scenario corresponds to a change of approximately 510 in the 2050s compared to the presentday and a further change of approximately 510 in the 2080s compared to the 2050s The no adaptation scenario maintains the sensitivity and adaptive capacity components of the index at the presentday level Technical detail about the methodology Met Office Our climate is changing There have been observed increases in global temperatures reductions in snow and ice and rising sea levels and humans are responsible for at least half of the observed changes IPCC 2013 Climate model projections show further changes to the climate system in years to come these changes will depend on future concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere Climate models project an increase in global average temperature rising sea levels and changes to the water cycle under every future greenhouse gas concentration pathway Furthermore the changes experienced in the near future will be as a result of past emissions of greenhouse gases this is climate change that we are committed to Climate models are used to explore the range of possible responses of the climate system to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations A low greenhouse gas concentration pathway could limit the increase in global average temperature to around 2Â°C above preindustrial levels the current target of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC A high greenhouse gas concentration pathway could see increases of 4Â°C or more The impacts of a rise in global average temperature will be felt differently at regional and local scales Increases in extreme temperatures frequency and severity of floods and droughts and intensity of storms will impact all aspects of human wellbeing such as access to food and water resources poverty and health IPCC 2014 The Met Office Hadley Centre undertakes worldleading research in climate science and provides worldclass guidance on the science of climate change Met Office scientists work collaboratively with other organisations and sectors to further understand and communicate the potential impacts of climate change on human wellbeing to inform policy makers Climate scientists from the Met Office Hadley Centre have worked in collaboration with food security analysts from the World Food Programme to better understand the relationship between climate change and food insecurity More information about the relationship between climate change and food insecurity By bringing together expertise in climate science and food security the climate and food insecurity index has been developed which measures vulnerability of the food system to climaterelated hazards in developing and leastdeveloped countries This website allows exploration of possible future projections of the index under a range of climate change and adaptation scenarios providing policyrelevant human food security outcomes for use in longterm food security adaptation planning World Food Programme WFPâs vision is to eradicate hunger in our lifetime a bold aim that is manifested in the Sustainable Development Goals and is at the centre of Agenda 2030 Zero Hunger cannot be achieved without urgent and ambitious action to address the challenge of climate change As the largest agency fighting hunger worldwide WFP is working to understand the effects of climate change and help foodinsecure communities prepare for respond to and recover from climaterelated disasters A large part of our work involves helping governments to analyse and understand the links between food security climate hazards and climate change so that they can take the necessary actions and investments to eradicate climaterelated hunger in their country through more effective policy and programme Climate risks today have a disproportionately negative impact on foodinsecure people 80 percent of whom live in countries that are prone to natural disasters and face high levels of environmental degradation Climate change will make these risks worse â and make the investments needed to achieve â and maintain â Zero Hunger even greater The Food Insecurity and Climate Change Vulnerability Index offers a window on our global future up to the 2080s looking at how climate change may affect future vulnerability to food insecurity Depending on our actions future generations will inherit a world with less vulnerability than today â or a world with significantly more vulnerability to food insecurity A world where keeping hunger at bay is achievable â or one where we will struggle to keep the scourge of hunger at bay WFP believes that hunger can be eradicated by 2030 But this rigorous scientific analysis presents a sobering picture showing that climate change is making the task more difficult and costlier It shows that even after 2030 because of climate change we will need to remain vigilant and continue to invest heavily in adaptation to preserve the gains we make in the next 15 years Massive increases in investment are needed to end hunger by 2030 and to enable the poorest people to build resilient livelihoods But we must do more than simply achieve the SDGs â we must build a world where they are maintained and continue to improve To do this we must make sure we address the causes of climate change and continue to invest in resilience and adaptation after 2030 to protect the gains we will have made Find out more about how climate change impacts hunger × How it works Explore future projections of the climate and food insecurity index for a range of scenarios of different future global greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation levels Emissions There are three global greenhouse gas scenarios to choose from low medium or high emissions The âLowâ scenario is known as RCP26 which is equivalent to a rapid and sustained reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions The âmediumâ scenario is known as RCP45 which is equivalent to a modest reduction in future global greenhouse gas emissions The âHighâ scenario is known as RCP85 which is equivalent to a considerable increase in future global greenhouse gas emissions Adaptation There are three adaptation levels to choose from high low or no adaptation The âHighâ scenario improves agricultural sensitivity and adaptive capacity by around 1015 per time period The âLowâ scenario improves these factors by around 510 per time period The amount of change applied to each country depends on the vulnerability of that country in the presentday The more vulnerable the country the larger the change The âNoneâ scenario applies no change from the presentday See the âBackground Scienceâ page in the âAboutâ information tab in the top right corner for more detail about these scenarios and the climate and food insecurity indexâ × How it works The presentday measure of vulnerability to food insecurity uses meteorological data for the period 19812010 and

gaset dimension2 790 Dan Barber 2421193 views • 1902 Details About the talk So Ive known a lot of fish in my life Ive loved only two That first one it was more like a passionate affair It was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty a bestseller on the menu What a fish Laughter Even better it was farmraised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability So you could feel good about selling it I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months One day the head of the company called and asked if Id speak at an event about the farms sustainability Absolutely I said Here was a company trying to solve whats become this unimaginable problem for us chefs How do we keep fish on our menus For the past 50 years weve been fishing the seas like we clearcut forests Its hard to overstate the destruction Ninety percent of large fish the ones we love — the tunas the halibuts the salmons swordfish — theyve collapsed Theres almost nothing left So for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be a part of our future A lot of arguments against it Fish farms pollute — most of them do anyway — and theyre inefficient Take tuna a major drawback Its got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna Not very sustainable It doesnt taste very good either So here finally was a company trying to do it right I wanted to support them The day before the event I called the head of PR for the company Lets call him Don Don I said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea you dont pollute Thats right he said Were so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated And then he added Were basically a world unto ourselves That feed conversion ratio 25 to one he said Best in the business 25 to one great 25 what What are you feeding Sustainable proteins he said Great I said Got off the phone And that night I was lying in bed and I thought What the hell is a sustainable protein Laughter So the next day just before the event I called Don I said Don what are some examples of sustainable proteins He said he didnt know He would ask around Well I got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally I got on the phone with the head biologist Lets call him Don too Laughter Don I said what are some examples of sustainable proteins Well he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets I said Chicken pellets He said Yeah feathers skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feed I said What percentage of your feed is chicken Thinking you know two percent Well its about 30 percent he said I said Don whats sustainable about feeding chicken to fish Laughter There was a long pause on the line and he said Theres just too much chicken in the world Laughter I fell out of love with this fish Laughter No not because Im some selfrighteous goodytwo shoes foodie I actually am Laughter No I actually fell out of love with this fish because I swear to God after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken Laughter This second fish its a different kind of love story Its the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time She kind of set us up Laughter It came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color The chef had overcooked it Like twice over Amazingly it was still delicious Who can make a fish taste good after its been overcooked I cant but this guy can Lets call him Miguel — actually his name is Miguel Laughter And no he didnt cook the fish and hes not a chef at least in the way that you and I understand it Hes a biologist at Veta La Palma Its a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain Its at the tip of the Guadalquivir river Until the 1980s the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands They did it by draining the land They built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river Well they couldnt make it work not economically And ecologically it was a disaster It killed like 90 percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds And so in 1982 a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land What did they do They reversed the flow of water They literally flipped the switch Instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in They flooded the canals They created a 27000acre fish farm — bass mullet shrimp eel — and in the process Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction The farms incredible I mean youve never seen anything like this You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland I was there not long ago with Miguel Hes an amazing guy like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee Laughter Okay There we are slogging through the wetlands and Im panting and sweating got mud up to my knees and Miguels calmly conducting a biology lecture Here hes pointing out a rare Blackshouldered Kite Now hes mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton And here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe It turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa I asked him how he became such an expert on fish He said Fish I didnt know anything about fish Im an expert in relationships And then hes off launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants And dont get me wrong that was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing Its great but I was in love And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before So I interrupted him I said Miguel what makes your fish taste so good He pointed at the algae I know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships Its amazing But what are your fish eating Whats the feed conversion ratio Well he goes on to tell me its such a rich system that the fish are eating what theyd be eating in the wild The plant biomass the phytoplankton the zooplankton its what feeds the fish The system is so healthy its totally selfrenewing There is no feed Ever heard of a farm that doesnt feed its animals Later that day I was driving around this property with Miguel and I asked him I said For a place that seems so natural unlike like any farm Id ever been at how do you measure success At that moment it was as if a film director called for a set change And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see Thats success he said Look at their bellies pink Theyre feasting Feasting I was totally confused I said Miguel arent they feasting on your fish Laughter Yes he said Laughter We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds Well last year this property had 600000 birds on it more than 250 different species Its become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe I said Miguel isnt a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm Laughter He shook his head no He said We farm extensively not intensively This is an ecological network The flamingos eat the shrimp The shrimp eat the phytoplankton So the pinker the belly the better the system Okay so lets review a farm that doesnt feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators A fish farm but also a bird sanctuary Oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldnt even be there in the first place They brood in a town 150 miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests Every morning they fly 150 miles into the farm And every evening they fly 150 miles back Laughter They do that because theyre able to follow the broken white line of highway A92 Laughter No kidding I was imagining a March of the Penguins thing so I looked at Miguel I said Miguel do they fly 150 miles to the farm and then do they fly 150 miles back at night Do they do that for the children He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song Laughter He said No they do it because the foods better Laughter I didnt mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious — and I dont like fish skin I dont like it seared I dont like it crispy Its that acrid tarlike flavor I almost never cook with it Yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain it tasted not at all like fish skin It tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean I mentioned that to Miguel and he nodded He said The skin acts like a sponge Its the last defense before anything enters the body It evolved to soak up impurities And then he added But our water has no impurities OK A farm that doesnt feed its fish a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators And then I realized when he says A farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River Its a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff And when it works its way through the system and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered The system is so healthy it purifies the water So not just a farm that doesnt feed its animals not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators but a farm thats literally a water purification plant — and not just for those fish but for you and me as well Because when that water leaves it dumps out into the Atlantic A drop in the ocean I know but Ill take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive You might say its a recipe for the future of good food whether were talking about bass or beef cattle What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good Laughter Applause But for a lot people thats a bit too radical Were not realists us foodies were lovers We love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we eat organic And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says Hey guy I love pink flamingos but how are you going to feed the world How are you going to feed the world Can I be honest I dont love that question No not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world One billion people will go hungry today One billion — thats more than ever before — because of gross inequalities in distribution not tonnage Now I dont love this question because its determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years Feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked If were feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be Thats been the motivation its been the justification its been the business plan of American agriculture We should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business thats quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible Thats not a business and it isnt agriculture Our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources Not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not by pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea Want to feed the world Lets start by asking How are we going to feed ourselves Or better How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself Applause To do that dont look at the agribusiness model for the future Its really old and its tired Its high on capital chemistry and machines and its never produced anything really good to eat Instead lets look to the ecological model Thats the one that relies on two billion years of onthejob experience Look to Miguel farmers like Miguel Farms that arent worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships Because theyre the ones that are experts in flavor too And if Im going to be really honest theyre a better chef than Ill ever be You know Im okay with that because if thats the future of good food its going to be delicious Thank you Applause TED

nonpharmaceutical interventions NPIs on COVID19 transmission First across all countries and US states that we study the growth rates of daily deaths from COVID19 fell from a wide range of initially high levels to levels close to zero within 2030 days after each region experienced 25 cumulative deaths Second after this initial period growth rates of daily deaths have hovered around zero or below everywhere in the world Third the cross section standard deviation of growth rates of daily deaths across locations fell very rapidly in the first 10 days of the epidemic and has remained at a relatively low level since then Fourth when interpreted through a range of epidemiological models these first three facts about the growth rate of COVID deaths imply that both the effective reproduction numbers and transmission rates of COVID19 fell from widely dispersed initial levels and the effective reproduction number has hovered around one after the first 30 days of the epidemic virtually everywhere in the world We argue that failing to account for these four stylized facts may result in overstating the importance of policy mandated NPIs for shaping the progression of this deadly pandemic Acknowledgements and Disclosures Andrew Atkeson has benefited from conversations with James Stock on this topic We are grateful to Hongyi Fu for superlative research assistance The

waste heat of power plants Date May 13 2011 Source Inderscience Summary Nuclear desalination uses the excess heat from a nuclear power plant to evaporate sea water and to condense the pure water A research team from India and Italy argues that despite public concerns the low energy costs and convenience of this latter process make it the preferred option Share FULL STORY Nuclear desalination uses the excess heat from a nuclear power plant to evaporate sea water and to condense the pure water Writing in the appropriately named International Journal of Nuclear Desalination a team from India and Italy argue that despite public concerns the low energy costs and convenience of this latter process make it the preferred option advertisement A ready supply of fresh water is a human right but access to safe drinking water is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve in many parts of the world The problems of climate change and population growth are all leading to new pressures on water Desalination of brackish and sea water by reverse osmosis is expensive and inefficient Marco Rognoni of Saline Water Specialists in Gallarate Italy working with colleagues MP Ramaswamy and J Justin Robert Paden in Tiruchirappalli India have calculated the cost balance and demonstrated that the benefits of nuclear evaporative desalination outweigh conventional reverse osmosis The selection of the appropriate desalination technology between evaporation and reverse osmosis is grounded on several factors including investment cost maintenance cost degree of availability heaviness of the duty and the required purity of the desalinated water the team explains The main factor however is often the running cost of the plant and specifically the cost of the consumed energy Energy input accounts for 35 to 45 of the total cost of producing desalinated water using reverse osmosis in which sea water is forced under pressure through a semipermeable membrane a filter so that the ions that make it salty are left behind and purified water is formed on the other side of the membrane However energy costs are rising while environmental pressure on reducing greenhouse emissions requires alternative and sustainable energy sources for industrial processes Conventionally evaporative desalination is considered to be even less efficient purportedly requiring twice the energy However Rognoni and colleagues have recalculated the energies involved and suggest that not only is this a serious overestimate Calculations were previously based not on the efficiency of the water purification process but as a loss of energy from steam turbines They also point out that given the essentially free heat energy available as a byproduct of electricity generation using nuclear power evaporative desalination should be the best approach to generating fresh water make a difference sponsored opportunity Story Source Materials provided by Inderscience Note Content may be edited for style and

Choosing the right grow light spectrum for your commercial operation can be a challenge Many LED grow light suppliers have conflicting information on the topic due to bad marketing or simply a lack of knowledge in plant and light research In this article our light spectrum experts break down what light spectrum is how plants respond to light and how light spectrum influences plant growth What is Grow Light Spectrum Light spectrum is the range of wavelengths produced by a light source When discussing light spectrum the term ‘light’ refers to the visible wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that humans can see from 380–740 nanometers nm Ultraviolet 100–400 nm farred 700–850 nm and infrared 700–10 6 nm wavelengths are referred to as radiation As growers we’re most interested in the wavelengths that are relevant to plants Plants detect wavelengths that include ultraviolet radiation 260–380 nm and the visible portion of the spectrum 380–740 nm which includes PAR 400–700 nm and farred radiation 700–850 nm When considering light spectrum for horticultural applications greenhouse and indoor environments will differ With indoor environments your grow light’s spectrum will account for the total light spectrum that your crop receives Whereas in a greenhouse you must consider that your plants are receiving a combination of grow light and solar spectrum Either way the amount of each waveband that your crop receives will have significant effects on growth Let’s learn more about how this works This grow light spectrum chart illustrates how PAR coincides with visible light spectrum How Do Plants Respond to Light Plants use light for photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy Photomorphogenesis refers to how plants modify their growth in response to light spectrum One example of photomorphogenesis is a plant bending toward a light source Light also affects plants’ developmental stages such as germination and flowering The light that plants predominately use for photosynthesis ranges from 400–700 nm This range is referred to as Photosynthetically Active Radiation PAR and includes red blue and green wavebands Photomorphogenesis occurs in a wider range from approximately 260–780 nm and includes UV and farred radiation Did You Know Chlorophyll a and b are a plant’s primary photosynthetic pigments It’s important to note that chlorophyll most strongly absorbs red light 600–700 nm and blue 400–500 nm and minimally absorbs green light 500–600 nm Still photosynthesis is a more complex process than simply chlorophyll absorption and involves other chemicals whose interactions with light spectrum are still being understood Graph of chlorophyll absorption spectrum Why Use Light Spectrum When Growing Crops Plants have photoreceptors that can trigger different growth characteristics when activated by photons of specific wavelengths So by controlling your light spectrum you can affect powerful changes in plant growth Growth characteristics that can be affected using spectrum are listed below Fruiting Flowering yield Rate of growth Fresh weight Compactness Root development Plant health Color Flavor Nutrition It’s important to note that activating plant response using light spectrum is one component of a larger process and results are heavily dependent on many factors such as light intensity photoperiod growth environment plant species and even plant variety How Does Each Light Spectrum Affect Plant Growth Although results are dependent on other factors there are general rules of thumb that you can follow when using light spectrum to elicit different plant responses Outlined below is an overview of how each waveband is used for horticultural purposes so that you can trial light spectrum strategies in your own growth environment and with your chosen crop varieties UV Light Wavelengths 100–400 nm The UV waveband is outside of the PAR waveband and may offer new applications for horticulture that have not yet been well defined It’s easiest to think of UV radiation in similar terms to its effect on human health We all know that you can get sunburned from extended exposure to UV light while short exposures often result in a tan instead In this respect plants and people react similarly to UV light Like people plants can become damaged from exposure to UV radiation Plants also naturally elicit protective compounds to mitigate UV tissue damage In response to UV plants may turn darker or more purple Studies have shown that UVB light can enhance essential oil content and phenolic compounds in some herb species Potential of UV light include increased leaf coloration and thickness as well as resistance to environmental stress pests and fungus The amount of UV required to achieve these potential benefits is not well defined Additionally the dangers associated with UV are not yet well quantified Blue Light Wavelengths 400–500 nm Blue light has distinct effects on plant growth and flowering In general blue light can increase overall plant quality in many leafy green and ornamental crops A minimal amount of blue light is required to sustain normal plant development In terms of adjustable spectrum lighting strategies if we were to equate red light to the engine of your car then blue light would be the steering wheel When combined with other light spectrum wavebands blue light promotes plant compactness root development and the production of secondary metabolites Blue light can be utilized as a growth regulator which can reduce your need for chemical plant growth regulators PGRs Blue light can also increase chlorophyll accumulation and stomatal opening facilitating gas exchange which can improve overall plant health One example of blue light influencing secondary plant metabolite production is how blue wavebands promote anthocyanin development in leaves and flowers Increased anthocyanin levels result in more pronounced color Blue light also promotes other secondary metabolic compounds associated with improved flavor aroma and taste For example blue light treatments have been shown to improve terpene retention in some varieties of cannabis Higher intensities of blue light 30 μmol·m 2 ·s 1 can inhibit or promote flowering in daylengthsensitive crops Blue light does not regulate flowering at low light intensities 30 μmol·m 2 ·s 1 so is safe to be applied at night to influence the other plant characteristics listed above Green Light Wavelengths 500–600 nm Since chlorophyll does not absorb green light as readily as other wavelengths many have written off the green waveband as being less important to plant growth This lower chlorophyll absorption rate compared to blue and red light is what makes most plants appear green Depending on the plant leaves generally reflect 1050 of green waveband photons In contrast to assumptions studies of green light in crop production have concluded that green light is important to photosynthesis and especially in a plant’s lower leaves Around 80 of green light transmits through chloroplasts whereas leaves absorb approximately 90 and transmit less than 1 of red and blue light So what does this all mean When light is plentiful chlorophyll reaches a saturation point and can no longer absorb red and blue light Yet green light can still excite electrons within chlorophyll molecules located deep within a leaf or within chloroplasts lower in the plant’s canopy And so green light enhances photosynthetic efficiency—potentially increasing crop yields during bright light conditions Additionally the ratio of green to blue and red wavelengths signals to the plant a leaf’s canopy position This can induce morphological changes to maximize light absorption Green light also plays a role in regulating stomatal aperture opening and closing of plant pores that make gas exchange possible Greenhouse applications require less supplemental green light since plants receive adequate green light from solar radiation Indoor environments may benefit more from supplemental green light since no sunlight is present Red Light Wavelengths 600–700 nm Red light is among the most effective wavebands at stimulating photosynthesis and promoting plant biomass growth Plants grown under only red light tend to become stretched and tall with thin leaves a generally undesirable growth pattern However adding the correct amount of blue light to balance out the red light can result in more compact plants with thicker leaves For this reason it’s always important to consider the multiple ways in which different wavebands of light influence each other rather than relying solely on one waveband for healthy plant development Farred Light Wavelengths 700–850 nm Farred light is at the far end of the red spectrum between 700–850 nm Studies have found that plants respond to wavelengths up to 780 nm Recently there has been increased attention and research related to the potential for farred light to increase and control growth Farred light can induce a shade avoidance response which results in extension and stretching read below for more information on shade avoidance Farred light also promotes flowering in longday plants and leaf expansion which increases the available surface area to capture photons for photosynthesis There have also been recent reports that farred can increase efficiency of the PAR waveband associated with photosynthesis It’s important to consider how phytochromes a class of photoreceptors perceive the ratio of red to farred radiation RFR Phytochromemediated regulation is a complex process that can have a profound impact on extension growth and flowering The ratio of blue to red light present can also impact how plants respond to farred radiation What is shadeavoidance response In nature sunlight contains almost as much farred light 20 as red light 21 Leaves at the top of the canopy are most exposed to sunlight and readily absorb red light while reflecting or transmitting most farred light As a result leaves lower in the canopy have less red light available and receive a higher proportion of farred light This relatively low red to farred ratio triggers stems to extend and leaves to expand to intercept more sunlight Supplemental LED lighting can induce this response Due to the stretching response of plants to farred light growers who benefit from more compact growth must cautiously add farred to their lighting regimen Make sure to consider the ratio of farred light to other wavebands and the crop variety when adding farred light to your lighting recipe While scientists do not fully understand how farred light modifies plant growth it plays a critical role in photosynthetic efficiency The “ Emerson Effect ” is the notion that two photosystems one that is most sensitive to 680 nm photons and one to 700 nm photons and farred light up to 850 nm work together to optimize electron transport and photosynthetic rates The systems are synergistic that is their joint contribution to photosynthesis is greater than the sum of their individual contributions Additional research may uncover the best way to deploy farred across varied crop types and varieties How to Use Light Spectrum for Plants Using the guidelines above growers can make reasonable assumptions for how their crops will react when adjusting their grow lights’ spectral ratios using smart horticultural lighting software In summary we see the following applications of light spectrum for horticulture to be common Red Light More red light tends to induce more biomass growth and stretching Red light is often applied to bulk up plants in early development or to stretch plants when longer internodal spacing is desired Blue Light Higher ratios of blue light are a powerful tool for improving plant quality Improvements to biochemical processes often occur when more blue light is present resulting in better nutrition color root development and overall quality Deploying higher ratios of blue light often means less total PPFD to the crop so these strategies should be used strategically and sparingly Green Light We understand that green light is important to photosynthetic efficiency and plant development though these processes are still being explored Adding supplemental green light is most important when there is no sunlight to provide adequate green light to crops The best pink LED grow lights take this into consideration and offer an adequate amount of green within their pink spectrum It would be impossible to provide a complete list of photomorphogenic processes for all plant cultivars so we instead recommend that you run your

reddit linkedin Email An indoor vertical farm Image Getty Stacked Farm an Australian automated vertical indoor farm has received international interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about the continuity of food supplies The farm produces salad greens and has the capacity for tomatoes and strawberries CEO Conrad Smith told Business Insider Australia Stack Farm received significant interest from the Middle East Visit Business Insider Australia’s homepage for more stories Aussie company Stacked Farm a fully automated vertical indoor farm has been gaining international interest amid the coronavirus pandemic Stacked Farm founded in 2017 produces salad greens and herbs like lettuce and rocket and has the capacity tp produce tomatoes and strawberries It’s even looking at testing out a type of blueberry next year The company has been receiving a lot of interest during the coronavirus pandemic amid concerns about virus clusters breaking out in the food supply chain Back in May a coronavirus cluster broke out at Melbourne’s Cedar Meats abattoir which was linked to 62 cases according to the ABC “People are more concerned than ever about who is handling their food where it’s coming from and how many stops it made before arriving on supermarket shelves” Stacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith said in a statement The company is headquartered in Burleigh Heads Queensland and has plans to open up farms across Australia as well “A scaledup farm in Victoria will be our first major commercial farm” Smith told Business Insider Australia Its farm is fully automated with the produce packed and sealed once its harvested by robotic farming “It doesn’t pass through the usual supply chains either – greens and herbs can go directly to wholesalers retails hotels and restaurants unlike traditional produce which passes through a number of hands before reaching our shelves” Smith said in a statement Stacked Farm has a partnership with fresh produce supplier Morco Fresh and counts Dnata as one of its clients as well which provides aircraft services like flight catering “We are not too dissimilar to a normal farm where we go through markets and we go through wholesalers and food service distributors” Smith said And while it mainly supplies to the food service industry Stacked Farm is looking at a move into retail so people can grab its produce from supermarket shelves as well “We haven’t got the capacity to do that at the moment” Smith said “But when we scale up to our Victorian farm we will certainly have the capacity to do that and we’ll be looking for retail partners to jump on the journey that we’re on” The farms are temperature controlled and automated Stacked Farm CEO Conrad Smith Image Troy Archer Stacked Farm grows its produce 12 months a year without relying on different seasons Its products are grown in a temperaturecontrolled environment that is fully automated from seeding to harvesting The company is looking at postharvest automation as part of its next business phase Stacked Farm also makes barleybased livestock feed “In a droughtvulnerable country like Australia there’s a lot of opportunity there because while we all think about human consumption animals are a massive part of the food chain that needs to be considered” Smith said The company’s employees are mainly in the science and tech field rather than traditional farm labourers “We’re not like traditional farms where we require pickers packers and harvesters” Smith said “We employ more labour leaning towards engineering software engineering mechanical engineering CAD designers and horticultural scientists” The company has been receiving interest from the Middle East Stacked Farm has received international interest in its farm during the coronavirus pandemic mainly thanks to concerns over food safety quality and security “There’s a lot of food chains that have been broken throughout this COVID19 pandemic and we’ve had interest from the Middle East to set up farms there” Smith said “We have been very enthused by the interest from particularly a couple of states in the Middle East that have governments that really support local industry and local farming” Smith gave the example of Dubai which relies predominantly on imports According to Bloomberg the United Arab Emirates imports up to 90 of its food Smith explained that in Dubai “a lot of produce can’t travel by sea” “They’ve immediately recognised that there’s a problem in their food chain and they need to bring tech businesses to their country to support feeding their people” And in the case of Stacked Farm can help feed livestock too Smith added that Stacked Farm can support the future of food production particularly in extremely hot and dry or extremely cold climates He explained that one in nine people go hungry around the world According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations by 2050 world food demand is expected to rise by 70 “Having urban indoor vertical farms is definitely an exciting prospect for the future” Smith said “We can literally shave days off out of the logistics process we can extend the shelf life of products so there’s less wastage and that in turn will benefit the community” Business Insider Emails Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox Email Address Join Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook Twitter LinkedIn and Instagram

from growing the foods of the future helping clean polluted water and even combating climate change Growing seaweed is now a ten billion dollar a year global industry Tim travels to Korea to see some of the biggest seaweed farms in the world and meets the scientists who are hoping to create a seaweed revolution here in Australia Broadcast Tue 22 Aug 2017 1200am Published Tue 22 Aug 2017 1200am Transcript plus minus PROF TIM FLANNERY Of all natures wild and wondrous organisms theres one Ive rather fallen for Because despite appearances seaweed has hidden superpowers Im Tim Flannery Im a scientist and environmental advocate Im going to explore how this humble weed has become a 10 billion dollar business Its all because seaweed is one of the fastest growing Life forms on the planet TIM Amazing how Long has this been growing 1K KYO CHUNG Just one season TIM One season Wow PROF TIM FLANNERY And Im going to find out how seaweed is being used to solve some of the worlds biggest problems Like growing the foods of the future cleaning polluted water and even combating climate change TIM Once it gets down below about a kilometer that carbon isnt coming back Dont worry this isnt a doom and gloom film this is about solutions Wow now Pia this is a science Lab This is fantastic PROF TIM FLANNERY And with our endless coastlines Australia could be a big player in a global seaweed revolution Seaweed has to be just about the most useful and underrated stuff on the whole planet Im diving the waters around Magnetic Island off the coast of Northern Queensland and somethings not right The Great Barrier Reef is just a short boat ride away And where I should see radiant coral this seaweed is taking over Theyre growing fast partly on nutrients that have washed off the Land along the coast The Great Barrier Reef is really in trouble and part of the problem comes from the Land where theres farms who use fertiliser They run down the rivers into the ocean and cause things like seaweed to really bloom and grow strongly And thats can overwhelm the coral But the good news is theres an entirely nature solution to that kind of pollution problem And its all happening just a couple of hours down the coast outside the town of Ayr Ive hit the road with one of the worlds foremost seaweed experts Professor Rocky de Nys ROCKY Worried about my driving skills in the interview TIM No worries So is there a Lot of money going into seaweed at the moment ROCKY There is Because it does such a good job in remediating the environment theres millions of dollars being invested in research TIM Thats sounds fantastic Id Love to see what youre doing ROCKY Well Tim Lets go fishing TIM Ah wow Now youve got me hooked mate Very interested ROCKY Oh nice work Lets see what we can find PROF TIM FLANNERY Rockys university has teamed with a technology firm to develop an experimental seafood farm Each pond holds 12 tonnes of prawns or 30 tonnes of fish Theres over 100 ponds but the secret to this whole place is seaweed Geeze Rocky These are mighty fish mate Ive never heard of cobia before What are they ROCKY Commonly known as black kingfish Theyre an oceanic species and theyve been adapted to growing in ponds and did remarkably well fast very fast very sustainable and fierce Im Looking forward to see how you go with the catching TIM I know these fellas are being harvested today so we better do our best to get a good Look at one ROCKY Good Luck Tim TIM So what sort of seaweed is this Rocky ROCKY Its a species called ulva its commonly called sea Lettuce and the great thing about ulva is it grows in the intertidal so its really adapted to grow in a big range of temperature really strong sunlight and changes in salinity so it as we go through the growing seasons on the farm its robust and it keeps growing and it provides year round bioremediation that we need to maintain clear water TIM So it can take anything you throw at it basically ROCKY Its quite amazing in that regard Its tough customer No doubt about it TIM And how fast does it grow ROCKY Triple in a week TIM Tripling in a week in volume ROCKY Yes yeahand thats why we harvest every day TIM So Rocky why does this stuff grow so fast ROCKY Its quite amazing isnt it So its all photosynthetic There are no structural tissues holding it up Its not Like a tree with a trunk— everything that it there has the capacity to grow The faster is grows the more nitrogen phosphorus and carbon is taken out of the system and when we harvest that its ready to repurpose PROF TIM FLANNERY Rocky believes hes turned fast growing seaweed into a pollution solution Farmed seafood has already overtaken farmed beef as a source of protein if it can be grown cleanly using a natural process like seaweed it could help feed the world without polluting the environment And its Lunchtime Queensland style Reeffriendly seaweedgrown tiger prawns And a chance to find out what Rockys doing with all the seaweed hes growing ROCKY Here we go Tim TIM Oh Rocky that Looks magnificent ROCKY Doesnt it Fresh out of the pond TIM Are they From the farm ROCKY Yes from the farm TIM Wonderful Wow But whats this here Looks Like a bit of your weed has got mixed in with it ROCKY Fresh off the farm as well TIM Oh really ROCKY Something to try Adds an extra touch of flavour TIM Okay can I put a bit on one of yours ROCKY You can Please Its terrific TIM Wonderful Well Im going to hop in to one of these Thanks mate Well this is Queensland for you mate ROCKY Perfect one day beautiful the next TIM Laughs Thats right That seaweed actually is a beautiful garnish ROCKY Mmm yes TIM But youre growing a ton of this seaweed a day if I remember ROCKY Thats correct Yes we do TIM So youre not eating a ton a day are ya ROCKY Well that would be a challenge TIM So where is most of your crop going at the moment ROCKY At the moment it goes into an organic fertiliser Its used on banana plantations PROF TIM FLANNERY And Rocky is experimenting with a special Long Lasting fertiliser by baking his seaweed into a kind of charcoal called biochar Those prawns are delicious but now Lets step this way ROCKY Here we go Tim — biochar Have a Look at that TIM Oh yes Well its nicely pelletised Rocky Look at that Beautiful stuff there ROCKY Comes out of the kiln that way Its ready to go TIM Yeah its fantastic Look at that Beautiful So thats made from seaweed ROCKY Thats made from seaweed TIM And what percentage of it is carbon ROCKY 2030 Depending on how you make it But what were trying to do is also make that carbon stay in that soil for as Long as possible So if you put the biochar into the soil— youre providing a Longterm benefit to soil structure and to nutrients — But you have to make it the right way There are a few tricks in the process TIM I can imagine mate ROCKY Yeah And once youve mastered those you can develop a product that provides the carbon benefit and some fertiliser and some trace elements and try and get the best of PROF TIM FLANNERY So a Little of the carbon dioxide that was warming the atmosphere has now been captured right here in my hand And Rockys seaweed roadshow has one Last stop because Australia is at the forefront of a pollutionbusting seaweed discovery ROCKY So Tim — Might be something else we can do with this seaweed TIM Oh yeah ROCKY Were in cattle country What you can do is you can feed seaweed to cows and it cuts down their production of methane TIM That sounds fantastic Well if you get a big reduction that would be really substantial ROCKY Well methane has 23 times the effect of C02 in terms of greenhouse gas warming so it will make a big difference TIM Sure well it sounds good but does the meat end up tasting Like fish ROCKY Very funny No PROF TIM FLANNERY Strange to think Putting a bit of seaweed in a cows diet might be such good news for all of us Spending time with Rocky has really opened up for me the potential seaweeds offer And this is just the start because Australia Leads the world in other valuable ways it can be used including in our own diet Im heading two thousand kilometres south to the town of Nowra to meet a scientist turned seaweed entrepreneur Pia Winberg has spent her Life researching how seaweed can contribute to human health Five years ago she set up her own business TIM So Pia you used to be an academic but now youre a businesswoman so why is that DR PIA WINBERG Well Tim I found that doing the research on how seaweed can save the world It wasnt really getting through and so the only way to really do that was to make seaweed mean something to people and people have actually forgotten how seaweed can actually help them every day in their nutrition and health even in future medical devices that were starting to do research on PROF TIM FLANNERY Pias work is part of a growing body of evidence on the health benefits of seaweed PIA My friend David is a great chef and makes some fantastic innovative cuisine TIM Hello Dave DAVID Hey Tim How are you TIM Good mate PIA Hi Dave Heres some seaweed that Ive just harvested in milk for you DAVID Oh fantastic Look Ive just Left you some flour out so do you want to get straight into TIM Yeh Im game DAVID — making some fresh pasta TIM Sure DAVID So if you want to grab two teaspoons straight into there Ill crack a few eggs TIM This is my first seaweed pasta ever Dave So forgive me if its not what it should be DAVID No worries TIM Pia how Long have people been eating seaweed PIA Oh theres records from 13000 years ago So its well known that seaweed has been a part of many cultures and their health and nutrition — And thats what seaweed can do in a pasta Like this Were just putting back nutrients iodine iron magnesium a whole Lot of really important trace elements Also weve got seaweed dietary fibres that are really important for gut health — and were about 50 deficient in dietary fibres and thats been Linked to a Lot of our chronic disorders — obesity and diabetes and seaweed can really help overcome those And of course theres the Omega three PROF TIM FLANNERY There is evidence Omega 3 fatty acids play a part in the functioning of our brain and you can get Omega 3 from eating seaweed TIM Gee it Looks good on the plate doesnt it PIA Its beautiful TIM Fantastic DAVE There you go guys — Enjoy your seaweed pasta TIM Thank you Dave Wonderful MmGee its good I can feel my mental processes improving by the bite Its fantastic Mm PIA Its got the edge on pasta without seaweed TIM I guess seaweeds got a bad reputation really People see it on the beaches in stinky piles and think oh I dont think I want to eat that Its as far from that as you can imagine PIA Well people see seaweed at the end of its Life dont they You dont feel Like going to a compost heap in your backyard you wouldnt eat that either But seaweed in its natural environment — is stunning beautiful and full of flavour PROF TIM FLANNERY But the uses of seaweed go well beyond food theres serious money to be made by those who understand seaweeds complex biology PIA In Australia we have really unique seaweeds in our oceans We can come to the plate with a whole new suite of species that are unexplored with exciting molecules And the products weve found really could help a Lot of people PROF TIM FLANNERY And the most valuable of all may be products designed for use inside the human body Its an idea inspired by a traditional use of seaweed Pia has anyone checked this for crabs PIA The ancient form of seaweed baths Something I Learnt in Ireland where theyre still doing it Enjoy it— Hop in TIM If its good enough for my ancestors I suppose I gotta give it a go Still oh my goodness PIA How does that feel Tim TIM It feels a Little slimy PS — very slimy Oh my goodness gracious Ohh PIA What youre feeling Tim is the molecules from the seaweed that are coming out now So the molecules in seaweed are sort of basically very compatible with the human because were both salty TIM I feel a bit too compatible at the moment Now is the contact between the seaweed and me at all important PIA Yeah go ahead — Put it all over you —Thats the point TIM Well here we go Wow my God that feels strange the bath is full of freshly harvested Australian crayweed Piping hot this species oozes buckets of thick slime Thats the most peculiar feeling PIA Looks great Tim TIM It really is very strange Its these slimy gels that hold seaweeds together and theyre remarkably similar to the ones that hold human bodies together So researchers want to make use of them PROF TIM FLANNERY Its part of a promising new field of science called Glycobiology TIM Wow Now Pia this is a science lab This is fantastic PIA Yeah its fun isnt it Tim This is all of our seaweed babies PROF TIM FLANNERY And shes spent 20 years hunting Australias coastline for seaweeds with the most valuable properties Its a bit Like panning for gold PIA What weve got here are unique Australian species that weve actually done the genetic fingerprinting or bar coding if you like — TIM So this is the motherload PIA Its our motherlab Laughs TIM Motherlab Very good Right PROF TIM FLANNERY Shes been searching for a seaweed gel molecule with a genetic fingerprint that mirrors the connective tissues of human skin PIA So come in here and see our skin matrix molecule that is really exciting for us Its extracted here sitting in this yellowish solution but we really want to purify it to be able to make use of it And so we can do that in this vessel here PROF TIM FLANNERY Having found the right seaweed then Pia has to extract the glycomolecules to reveal the most expensive seaweed product yet discovered PIA Youll see here — the purification TIM Yep thats already happened hasnt it Thats flocculation PIA Yep TIM So this is your most valuable product is it PIA Thats right So this is the molecule that is just Like the connective tissue in our own body — which means we can use it for highend medical devices and applications Even for printing new tissue or injecting it into knees to prevent us from getting osteoarthritis For molecules Like that youre paying Like 10000 dollars a kilo TIM Wow so thats the top shelf PIA Top product Tim TIM Right Very good PROF TIM FLANNERY And researchers at the University of Wollongong have regenerated kneecap cartilage by injecting stem cells into her seaweed gel And different seaweeds have different properties once you identify those properties you can make other surprising things And what about this one here This Looks Like plastic almost PIA Yep so we are doing some more chemistry with the seaweed here and pulling out some really interesting materials TIM So currently plastics are made out of fossil fuels So if you can make plastics out of seaweed youre turning a Liability into a huge asset surely PIA Yeah thats right Tim The molecules that we are turning into plastics now came from algae or plants to start with — and what were really doing here is growing them from biosphere weve got rather than digging them up like fossils So another material Tim is you know Look at this one Its Like Leather And thats from the same seaweed TIM Wow I go to Bavaria occasionally Do you think I could make them into a nice pair of Lederhosen PIA Im sure youd sing a Lot better with pants Like that Tim TIM I think its called yodelling Laughs Thats fantastic Given continued investment the work going on here could see interesting results in years to come The artificial implants certainly show some promise PIA This facility is you know a ghosttown of what once was a great industry The Shoalhaven paper mills used to employ about 600 people back in the day So what was once a Large industry — were seeding it with the future PROF TIM FLANNERY Central to the operation is her seaweed farm Wow well this really is industrial scale Pia this is great to see PIA Yeah well this is how you grow seaweed fast A few hundred kilos of seaweed in these pools Tim TIM Right Well I can feel the seaweed down there would you mind if I pulled a bit out and have a Look PIA I wouldnt do that though Tim TIM Okay all right PIA This is pretty secret seaweed that were working with for these very special molecules that were pulling out TIM Okay well I dont want to reveal any industrial secrets But just looking at this here theyre bubbling Whats going on here what is it thats bubbling up PIA So thats carbon dioxide sequestration in action Theres not many places on earth where it would happen faster than right here TIM Wow Okay And the C02 is coming from where are you getting the C02 from PIA Well thats from the fermentation from the wheat refinery processes TIM Okay and is that that thing over there PIA Thats it over there Tim PROF TIM FLANNERY Turning wheat into flour creates carbon dioxide which is piped across to the seaweed farm Its dissolved into the water tanks to help the seaweed grow I think what Pia is building here is pretty inspiring shes taken a weed that so many of us ignore and discovered properties that hint at unexpected benefits for human health Ive been surprised at the things this humble weed can do And it has me thinking about an even bigger task Its something close to my heart For many years Ive been involved in issues around climate change and right now the Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are a problem — and thats where seaweed might really help Seaweed grows by using the suns energy and photosynthesis And as it does so it takes C02 dissolved in oceans and builds tissues Ultimately that C02 has come from the atmosphere And this stuff can grow 60m a year in some cases and its a Lot safer Locked up in seaweed than in atmosphere or in the oceans Im wondering if we covered the ocean seaweed farms could we draw down enough carbon to even reverse climate change And thats what I want to find out Could you farm seaweed on the open ocean to draw down carbon from the atmosphere To do so I need to Leave these shores in search of some of the biggest seaweed farms on the planet And in my hunt for a big scale seaweed industry Ive come to Seoul capital of South Korea Its a city 2000 years old with its roots in the past and its eyes on the future And Ive arrived on a most auspicious day Buddhas birthday According to tradition his two thousand five hundred and sixty first Its Like nothing Ive ever seen before AIL these Lanterns are hung with prayers And Ive got one of my own I just asked for a great seaweed harvest for Korea on Buddhas birthday so its gotta come true Wow — Thats so cool Seaweed is one of the great traditions of Korean culture and fifty million people use a Lot of it Tomorrow Ill get my first chance to see the scale of the Korean seaweed enterprise Im starting my journey in a murky Seoul dawn Ive been to Seoul a couple of times — and every time I arrive here the air pollution gets worse As you can tell — People wearing masks theres not many people on streets and its becoming a real issue right across North East Asia This is fine particulate pollution Nasty stuff It comes from cars and power stations and other heavy industry And its becoming a big health problem Ill be glad to get to the coast to breathe some fresh air and to see some seaweed I think our climates future might depend on growing it big scale Scientists think there might be a place to store such huge quantities of seaweed carbon that global warming could be rolled back Theres one big idea behind my seaweed quest and that is that under certain circumstances seaweed can store carbon at a bigger scale and more permanently than any plant you can see out there So were on the Land at the moment but the ocean is very very deep Any carbon that plants capture in this area here —just keeps on interchanging with the atmosphere over time Trees grow then they die and rot — the carbon stays in the system But if you could somehow grow seaweed out here — on rafts maybe or some other way —and then use seaweed for something and toss the carbon into deep or just put the seaweed itself into the deep ocean — once it gets down below a kilometre — that carbon isnt coming back Thats stored not as permanently as geological carbon like coal but as far as were concerned with the climate crisis — Its out of the system Half the planet is covered in oceans three kilometres deep or more Its potentially a huge carbon store But the amount of seaweed needed to take advantage of it suggests a seaweed industry thats beyond my imagination So thats why Im on my way to the biggest seaweed industry event in the world Its being hosted far in the South on the Island of Wando And their International Seaweed Expo is Like nothing I could have imagined One hundred and fifty countries have sent delegations Half a million people have been through the gates This is just amazing — this expo has taken over the town At a cost of ten million dollars this expo is a serious investment in seaweed backed by the top end of town GOVERNOR TRANSLATED FROM KOREAN This Expo will not only contribute to a proper understanding of seaweeds but also promote their significance as an industry of the future PROF TIM FLANNERY And seaweeds future is what Ive come to see This is the big one — this is the one that might just save the world Theres evidence of seaweed innovations Like seaweed bioplastics and materials even signs of seaweed biofuels I meet an entrepreneur who wants to save forests by making paper from seaweed HACK CHURL YOU We have to change the way we make paper from wood So seaweed pulp can help prevent global warming PROF TIM FLANNERY Fantastic Wow Heres a whole house made of seaweed — Its an experimental one but I tell you Its pretty impressive This expo is proof the global seaweed industry is innovating And not all these will take off Weve got toothpaste as well You want white teeth Use seaweed So many products Very good Thank you But the powerhouse driving all this innovation in the seaweed industry is a multi billion dollar food business Its good to see scale and innovation both will be needed if were going to store carbon in the deep ocean Kamsa hamnida Thank you I dont know what sort of seaweed it is but its pretty bloody good But feeding this industry must be big scale seaweed farming And I want to find it The island of Wando is just one of hundreds of Islands in an archipelago clustered around the Southern foot of Korea and they produce a million tons of seaweed a year And I shouldnt have to go far to find it I understand at the top of this hill — is the very best place to see Wandos famous seaweed farms and Im really keen to get a Look because I think its like Looking into the future Im Looking for the kind of scale that could fill a million square kilometres with seaweed farms Wow The scale of this is almost unbelievable As far as I can see to the horizon theres seaweed farms The scale of seaweed farming here is really astonishing As far as I can see there are Little buoys where the seaweed hangs from Suspended from these buoys are tens of thousands of metres of rope all growing seaweeds in the sun Is this the seaweed farming system that could roll out across the worlds oceans to help reverse climate change To Learn the secrets of growing seaweed big scale Ive come to meet Koreas Leading authority on seaweed Professor 1k Kyo Chung TIM Oh hello — Professor Chung Yeah good to see you Thank you Good So is this our boat CHUNG Yeah TIM And we have to hurry The seaweed boat is Leaving and I want to be on it It seems to me that seaweed farming has been part of Korean culture for a very Long time CHUNG Yes very Long time we have a Long history TIM Hundreds of years Or CHUNG More than that I think TIM Really Wow okay It seems to me as the country has developed a really deep expertise in seaweed growing and genetics Is it well advanced that knowledge here CHUNG Yeah Yeah thats right TIM Well Looking at this vast field of seaweed here — CHUNG Yeah yeah yeah TIM Youre obviously growing Large amounts Its what I hoped to find This is commercial scale seaweed farming The equipment the experience its all here and so is the seaweed These farmers are growing a species of kelp called Laminaria and it grows very fast Oh Look at this stuff mate How how Long has this been growing CHUNG I think just one one season TIM One season Wow So just through the winter CHUNG Yeah through the winter TIM Thats a huge growth Wow On just one Line is two tonnes of Laminaria nearly a third of which is carbon theres maybe two thirds of ton of carbon right in front of me I can taste it CHUNG Its just a Little salty TIM Oh yeah its good though Its nice Chung has researched how much carbon seaweed can store Just a hundred square metres of seaweed can capture 16 tonnes of carbon a year Thats a crucial number and a very encouraging one But because seaweeds dont Live for as Long as trees theyve not been accepted as carbon storage solutions So youve done the basic science but is there anyone being paid for sequestering carbon in seaweed CHUNG No not yet Everyone wants to do some terrestrial environment Like trees those kind of things TIM Yeah CHUNG And you can see the trees and the carbon thats there but seaweed you cannot see TIM So theyre not looking at deep ocean sequestration CHUNG No not yet seaweed cannot grow in open sea because of the Lack of nutrients Offshore is Like a desert I think that idea comes from you Laughs PROF TIM FLANNERY Well Im keen on the idea of open ocean seaweed farming and I know people are working on it and seeing this massive farm makes me think it might be possible But this visit has highlighted a problem AIL the seaweed growing around me feeds off nutrients that wash off the Land Like they were at Magnetic Island Its a coastal phenomenon Seaweeds need to be close to the surface where theres sunlight but in the open ocean the nutrients are down too deep for the seaweeds to reach So If we are going to try to sink Lots of carbon with ocean based farms we need to find them the nutrients And I need to find someone whos working on that part of the problem CHUNG Its a sea vegetable TIM A seaweed breakfast CHUNG Yeah thats right TIM Its very nice CHUNG Thats what we have TIM I think Im becoming Korean TIM and CHUNG Laughs PROF TIM FLANNERY Chung has researched how much carbon seaweed can store Just a hundred square metres of seaweed can capture 16 tonnes of carbon a year Thats a crucial number and a very encouraging one But because seaweeds dont Live for as Long as trees theyve not been accepted as carbon storage solutions TIM So youve done the basic science but is there anyone being paid for sequestering carbon in CHUNG No not yet Everyone wants to do some terrestrial environment Like trees those kind of things TIM Yeah CHUNG And you can see the trees and the carbon thats there but seaweed you cannot see TIM So theyre not Looking at deep ocean sequestration CHUNG No not yet seaweed cannot grow in open sea because of the Lack of nutrients Offshore is Like a desert I think that idea comes from you Laughs PROF TIM FLANNERY Well Im

someone whos working on that part of the problem But much of the seaweed expo is impressive all this money and enterprise is driving real innovation Its got me thinking whats something useful we could make with seaweed that could store carbon Long term The more carbon we take out of the atmosphere the better Time to get some help DR ADAM BUMPUS Hello TIM Hi Adam Tim Flannery here ADAM Hi Tim mate how are you TIM Im very well thank you Im wondering if you can help me with something I need someone to make me some seaweed bricks — ADAM Yeah okay I dont see why not PROF TIM FLANNERY Now we use billions of bricks every year but a seaweed brick could store carbon drawn out of the atmosphere ADAM With this stuff were trying to build something we really Like PROF TIM FLANNERY Dr Adam Bumpus is an expert in carbon economics and innovation Hes found a team with expertise in creating new building products from natural materials These are bricks that need no energy to fire them and no cement to stick them together ADAM Number 1 bricks We can have them interlocking A — theres a kind of pasteand B — PROF TIM FLANNERY By adding seaweed to those products I hope they can store carbon in such a way that it wont return to the atmosphere for a Long time Its out of harms way But it means turning squishy seaweed into a rock hard brick ADAM Ive got some seaweed here that I got from the beach RACKEL Oh wow ADAM Have a whiff PROF TIM FLANNERY And Im sure that wont be easy RACKEL Thats interesting material ADAM Can we turn this into a brick do you think PROF TIM FLANNERY Dr Racket San Nicolas and Engineering Student Phil are hard at work in the Geopolymers Lab Theyll need to find a way to keep the seaweed dry and stable so it can become a sturdy part of the brick PHIL Lets check out our hemp seaweed sample we made — Now thats held together quite nicely — That took very Little effort laughs at all to make that crumble — this ones a fail PROF TIM FLANNERY I never underestimate human beings chasing a goal under pressure but I fear Ive set a challenge here thats close to impossible PROF TIM FLANNERY Back in Australia Im Looking for a way to grow seaweed on the scale I saw in Korea but way out in the ocean Because to draw down enough carbon dioxide to roll back global warming it would have to be grown on a huge scale Prof Chung has given me some pretty conservative estimates of seaweed crop yields And using those I can estimate that if you wanted to draw down a gigatonne of carbon plant a seaweed farm size of south Australia it would be a million square kilometres If you wanted to offset all of human emissions so draw down all the carbon were putting in the atmosphere youd need a seaweed farm the size of Asia thatd be 9 of the worlds ocean covered in seaweed farm I dont think Im going to see that in my Lifetime But I do think its realistic to think of covering 1 of the worlds ocean in seaweed farms — and if we did that wed be pulling down 5 gigtonnes of carbon a year and that would be an enormous help in terms of addressing climate change Every year we put about 50 gigatonnes thats 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent into the atmosphere where it causes climate change But seaweed can draw this carbon out of the atmosphere Five gigatonnes would make a noticeable difference Twenty would make a big one but if seaweeds are going to help we need to grow them in the open ocean And theres a snag seaweeds photosynthesise using the suns energy But they also need nutrients and in the open ocean the nutrients are down too deep for the seaweeds to reach them Growing seaweed in the ocean will take great feats of marine engineering but scientists and engineers are starting to work on the problem Ive just come across this extraordinary proposal — funded in part by the Australian federal government — and it concerns the development of whats called a Marine Permaculture Array in the Indian ocean Now that array will consist of a 100m square grid that will be used to grow seaweed and other seafood Whats amazing about it is itll be operating in deep ocean it wont be tethered to the bottom it will be guided by satellites — and out there in the deep ocean theres no seaweed growing now because theres no nutrients So whoever has put this together has found a way to access those deep nutrients and feed the seaweeds in these permaculture arrays To find out just how theyre pulling up the nutrients Im speaking to the man behind the plan ecoentrepreneur Dr Brian von Herzen DR BRIAN HERZEN On our marine permaculture we run a Long pipe down several hundred metres into the sea where thats where the nutrients are and we pump them up to the seaweed with a combination of wind and wave and solar power Were estimating that for an investment of around five million dollars we can see a potential for yields of one million for the kelp biomass and another million every year for the fish TIM Wow fantastic — and tell me how Long is it going to take to get this operational BRIAN Well were expecting the system to be operational Later this year Were testing the hardware out this summer in Woods Hole Massachusetts and were hoping to deploy systems next year in Australia with further support TIM Wow so the first one is only a few months off Thats amazing BRIAN Well thank you so much TIM Yeh and you know I really think that youre onto something very fundamental here and its something very big So congratulations — I can hardly wait to see how it develops BRIAN Thank you Tim PROF TIM FLANNERY Ill be interested to see how Brians technology copes in the open ocean and whether it can deliver a result Brian believes his array should scale up to seaweed farms a square kilometre in size and to draw down a billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere every year youd need a million of those farms floating in the worlds oceans growing fish and capturing carbon Itll be ambitious challenging and certainly expensive And this plan makes one big assumption That all the seaweed will sink to the ocean bottom where it stays out of harms way Im meeting a scientist with doubts An expert in how carbon is stored — not in the ocean but in wetlands and hes not sure the deep ocean will so easily store the carbon from seaweed sometimes called macroalgae How do you feel about this opportunity — the potential opportunity for seaweed farming — If we take this seaweed into the deep ocean — Is that carbon going to stay there effectively forever PETER Ive got Ive got some reservations admittedly Does it end up in going into the sediments and does it end up getting preserved in those sediments I think thats the big research gap TIM Right PETER I want to see some research and data that we see that macroalgae end up in those deep sea areas but does something munch it up TIM Fair enough PROF TIM FLANNERY If seaweed is munched up before it gets to the deep ocean its carbon can return to the atmosphere So it needs to reach the deep ocean fast or be buried in ocean sediments where its safe from the microbes that munch it up Sediments are a natural carbon store and Peter shows me how they work in mangrove mud PETER The Microbes just cant really attack the carbon so its the perfect place to store our carbon TIM And the bottom of the core here how old do you think this is PETE Look — If we have 1 centimetre per year of accretion lets say thats about 60 centimetres — maybe 60 years old — About that TIM So that carbon has really be stored here safely for as Long as Ive been alive anyway PETE Thats right TIM Well that is very convincing PROF TIM FLANNERY In this mangrove mud its too cold and theres not enough oxygen for the microbes to munch up the carbon stored here PETER These ecosystems will store the carbon in the ground for thousands of years they retire it from the carbon cycle grabbing it out of the atmosphere and putting it in the ground its a watery grave and itll stay there PROF TIM FLANNERY Mangroves are clearly a great place to store carbon but they are relatively few in number To store all the carbon we need to draw out of the atmosphere something much bigger is needed So can the deep oceans do it The answers wont come easily The deep ocean is more alien than anything on Earth But if seaweed gets into the deep ocean there should be evidence of it One team has scoured deep sea surveys around the world and they think there is evidence DR DORTE KRAUSJENSEN And we were surprised to find many records of seaweeds in the deep ocean on the deep sea floor several thousand meters down So not only are they able to be exported there but they are also really fast — since theyre not decomposed before getting there Thats deeper than 1 kilometre then we talk about it being sequestered for considerable timescales Like several centuries TIM Wow really really exciting Thats fantastic Dorte PROF TIM FLANNERY Dorte thinks that one hundred and seventy three million tonnes of seaweed carbon is naturally sequestered in ocean sediment every year — ninety percent in the deep oceans Dortes study is showing that Lots of coastal seaweed is already finding its way into the deep ocean and that the carbon in that seaweed is staying down there out of the atmospheric carbon cycle i guess the big thing we dont know is if we do this on an industrial scale and grow seaweed farms that are transporting Lots of seaweed into the deep oceans what the consequence of that will be we wont know till we try it I guess Ultimately both mangrove wetlands and the deep sea will be needed to store the carbon we must draw out of the atmosphere And Im not done with seaweed Ive set a challenge to find out if it might be possible to store its carbon in the houses and cities of tomorrow I want to find out if the idea of seaweed bricks is a real possibility or a slimy dead end Us humans are just beginning our seaweed journey — but Im nearing the end of mine Im here to meet Adam Bumpus and see how hes going with his seaweed bricks I wanted Adam and his team to see if they could create an entirely new way to use seaweed Im hoping it could be the foundation of a new industry If theyve made it work TIM Hey Adam ADAM Hey Tim TIM Great to see you again ADAM You too How are you TIM Good thank you good I must say youve kept me in suspense about the bricks ADAM Yeah So to be honest weve had some issues with the bricks Ive got to be honest TIM Right ADAM Weve found some stuff that is really exciting — and thats what Id Love to show you today PROF TIM FLANNERY Seaweed isnt a promising material to turn into a brick So what have we got here Racket RACKEL So um its actually very very interesting TIM So is this your experiment RACKEL Exactly so thats completely a failure but what we are very happy about is we found why This seaweed apparently is extremely expandable So as soon as we are putting it into contact with any type of solution the solution that is inside the usual concrete it expands TIM Yes RACKEL And so PROF TIM FLANNERY Dr San Nicolas tested all geopolymer concrete solutions could one stop seaweed expanding RAKEL But we move onto actually the big discovery of these past two days Laughs TIM Yes PHIL Tadah Laughs RAKEL Its actually in this solution TIM Right RACKEL Potassium silicate and potassium hydroxide In this case youve got very very Little expansion TIM Yes indeed Yeah yeah RACKEL Compared to the other one SO we end up with this wonderful product TIM Oh now now thats much more Like it So this is a building material RAKEL I truly believe so TIM That is great RACKEL We can do structural — Fades out PROF TIM FLANNERY Australia alone uses 1 billion bricks and millions of tonnes of concrete a year If the world could replace a fraction of its bricks and concrete with a material thats cementfree Lowenergy and a safe storehouse for carbon maybe what Ive seen here today is another way seaweed can help save the world And Im interested to know whether Adams design team see these bricks as a viable alternative for the building industry HENRY Textures bloody great bit of playfulness to it you know And not only that it can be smoothed out as well so we can get other texture So its a really um flexible kind of item and material PHIL And that can be polished too cant it Racket RACKEL Yeah PHIL Bit of shine to it RACKEL Yeah JAY Looking at it Im quite amazed by how it Looks actually laughs so it will be really interesting to see how the tests go with it all and um yeah if itif it can get the same strength ratings as bricks I cant see why thewhat the Limitations to this material would be ANA Sustainability is something that is on the agenda TIM Yeah right ANA We have the responsibility toto actually tell the client you know what this exists And we could use it And these are the benefits TIM Ok great And perhaps this is how we push back against climate change brick by brick Ive taken this journey to find out if this humble weed could save the planet ROCKY Oh there we go thats a healthy Looking specimen TIM Thats a beautiful fish isnt it ROCKY Terrific isnt it TIM Wow Ive seen how we could be feeding the world on protein from seafood farmed with the help of seaweed So what volume can you put through this plant How seaweed could help clean up polluted water A million Litres a day ROCKY A million Litres a day Yeah TIM Go through this ROCKY Yes TIM How seaweed carbon can be stored in biochar Look at that Beautiful stuff there And could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cattle ROCKY If you can feed seaweed to cows and they reduce their production of methane And the many unlikely things it could be used to create PIA Look at this one — Its just like Leather TIM So this is a building material RACKEL It is a building material TIM But Ive been most excited by the potential to grow seaweed to slow climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in huge open ocean farm Wow the scale of this almost unbelievable I think these technologies hint at solutions our world needs but how much might they help ADAM So Tlm youve been all over the world Looking at this stuff — TIM Yes But Id Like to know what it all adds up to ADAM So you want ot get some numbers down TIM We do yeah ADAM Well why dont we pop in here TIM Great ADAM See if we can find a room and well get it down PROF TIM FLANNERY Adam is a carbon economy and innovation expert We cant be exact but some estimates will help gage the potential of the technologies Ive seen TIM So Adam Lets see if we can get some figures around these areas to see how much carbon we could sequester from seaweed ADAM Yeah good call Well heres an interesting one for protein It seems Like if people change their diets potentially we could actually use sustainable fish associated with these seaweed farms that could produce around about 118ish gigatonnes of savings per year TIM That is a massive number Adam ADAM Thats a big number TIM Huge ADAM But this is assuming that 9 billion people on Earth each eat 200 kilograms of fish a year TIM Right ADAM Thats a lot TIM Yes ADAM So probably its going to be quite a bit Less than that So why dont we say maybe its going to be a third of that TIM Alright ADAM You know 3 TIM 3 — yeah ADAM 3 gigatonnes per year TIM So were then Looking at feedstock ADAM Absolutely TIM And some of the figures Ive seen are huge ADAM It seems like something around about 24 gigatonnes per year TIM So these are very big savings Adam — ADAM Yes TIM Much bigger than I was thinking wed be getting ADAM If all of the cattle in the world ate a bit of seaweed TIM Thats encouraging I think ADAM It could be good yeah TIM So the other area we are Looking at was biochar ADAM It is incredibly promising because its not just sequestering the carbon —Its also helping productivity and nutrients TIM I wouldnt be adverse to a sort of very very rounded preliminary figure of 1 Laughs ADAM Alright well lets speak in 1 gigatonne TIM Alright So the other thing we saw is of course the manufacture of plastics clothing — and what sort of figures do you think we are Looking at for that ADAM Plastics and clothing — Its difficult to understand but of course we alsodont have to use oil for that plastics and the clothing so theres a Lot of saving there Its not just the sequestering of it — Its the supplanting of these emissions that we have right now Why dont we stick on a gigatonne for each TIM Thats reasonable I think thats good ADAM Okay Lets do that TIM And finally — this issue of storage which I think is one of the big ones If we can sink the seaweed down below a kilometre in the ocean — its stored permanently ADAM What was it — 9 of the ocean can store — TIM Thats right If you cover 9 of the worlds ocean in seaweed farms you could offset all of current emissions so 53 gigatonnes potentially which is big ADAM Thats a Lot I mean thats everything we emit right now — TIM Yeah exactly ADAM Its amazing But its also a huge amount of Landmass or ocean mass TIM Its a seaweed farm the size of Asia ADAM Huge TIM Its really big Laughs ADAM Right TIM Even if we took a tenth of that okay so a tenth that would be ambitious — but a tenth is still 5 gigatonne huh — ADAM Lets put that down TIM Give it a go Okay So what do we get there Weve got 5 6 7 8 104— 134 gigatonnes Of course 13 billion tonnes is just an estimate — but if this were possible then it WOULD have an impact on climate change ADAM This is not an impossible task TIM No ADAM This is real It can happen now TIM Biodegradable plastics from seaweed new feedstocks — you know this is a big future ADAM Yeah this is exciting TIM Right Lets get to work ADAM Laughs Absolutely thanks Tim TIM Some of these are more Likely to bare fruit than others but scaling up any of these concepts will require billions in investment But when transformative new ideas grip the world the changes they create can happen quickly and sweep old technologies into the dust bin of history We humans are really intelligent — And sometimes it seems to me we can do almost anything When it comes to climate change and seaweed — I think were really onto something My Last stop is the most personal of all Dr Alicia Felgrove is a seaweed scientist who is developing a project to farm seaweed right here in Melbournes Port Philip Bay Its where I grew up — And I hope to see it once again the flourishing habitat I remember as a child You know this place used to be my playground as a kid DR ALECIA FELGROVE Well there a huge possibility So we need to think carefully about where were going to be farming the seaweeds what were going to do with those seaweeds once we harvest them from the farms My concern is an ecologist and someone thats also really excited about the prospects that seaweed farming can bring is that we need to just tread cautiously — and we can often go into things hammer and tongs before we understand fully how these systems work PROF TIM FLANNERY Ocean farms are yet to be testing but I feel Like they present a big opportunity for Australia — Especially as our seaweed stocks are so rich ALECIA So were sitting in a part of the world that is got the highest biodiversity so this is a hotspot of biodiversity for seaweeds Theres more seaweeds in SouthEastern Australia than there is in any other part of the world So the potential is huge The understanding of what weve got is very small TIM Would you be surprised if within 500m of us there was a species of seaweed that hasnt been discovered yet ALECIA Not at all TIM So just projecting out 50 years — How important do you think these seaweeds growing within a kilometre of us are going to be ALECIA I think they will have HUGE potential to be part of our food security solutions TIM Sounds to me as if we have a national treasure here ALECIA Absolutely PROF TIM FLANNERY When I think about what wonders might be found in Australias seaweed treasure trove it brings me a Lot of hope The age of seaweed may be upon us and I cant wait to see these solutions start to unfold Credits plus minus Presenter Professor Tim Flannery Related download

156,html The vertical farming industry is growing deeper roots Greenbiz Skip to main content Analysis Events Webcasts Videos Search Sustainability Food Energy Transportation Circular Economy Cities More Twitter Facebook Instagram Linkedin This site RSS GreenBiz on Social Media Toggle navigation The vertical farming industry is growing deeper roots By Jean Haggerty November 11 2019 Plenty plans to build a global network of vertical farms starting with the west coast of the United States Plenty Close Authorship The urban indoor vertical farm industry is at an important juncture Automation is taking root longterm contracts with creditworthy retail and food service distributors are in the works and vertical farms are preparing to scale up Also the industry is about to get its first trade group the American Association for Urban and Vertical Farming The vertical farming industry in the US is at a point where — if provided facilitation in terms of industry coordination information exchange innovation education training funding etc — it can be enabled to reach critical mass said Joel Cuello a University of Arizona professor of biosystems engineering and vice chair of the Munichbased Association for Vertical Farming AVF Just as important a trade association can advocate for the industry and help it secure more funding In the 2018 US Farm Bill an annual allotment of 10 million was established to develop an office of urban agriculture and supporting projects said Neil Mattson controlled environment agriculture director and associate professorgreenhouse extension specialist at Cornell University That’s a relatively small amount that includes everything from vertical farms to urban community gardens Whether industrywide collaboration is needed or wanted at this stage is unclear Sharing information could accelerate the industry’s development but it also could dilute the value of a firm’s propriety research and development efforts Technology is important to reduce cost and to improve yields and quality and therefore to provide a better return on investment The existence of New York City’s Agriculture Collective — which counts AeroFarms Bowery Farming Smallhold and Square Roots as members — illustrates that there are ways for the urban farming industry to share knowledge Having a city or regional dimension to collaborative efforts is key especially when it comes to working in cities said Henry GordonSmith founder and managing director of Agritecture Consulting For example there is often a need for new zoning for indoor farming because it is not a permissible use of a building in an urban area he added The new vertical farm trade association will be affiliated with the AVF but the exact affiliation has not been negotiated yet A compelling story Vertical farming does a very good job of tapping into customers’ interest in tasty fresh and locally grown food Customers love it said Chris Manca Whole Foods Market’s local program coordinator for the Northeast region It connects with people who are passionate about local food and the environment Since 2014 Whole Foods has cultivated a hightech Gotham Greens greenhouse farm on the rooftop of its Gowanus Brooklyn store Leafy greens microgreens and herbs grown in this rooftop greenhouse are sold in its store downstairs in other nearby Whole Foods locations and at local restaurants In addition for the last year and a half the Whole Foods location in Bridgewater New Jersey also has been selling mushrooms grown in an instore vertical farm unit developed by the Brooklynbased organic mushroom farming company Smallhold More recently a second Smallhold instore mushroom growing unit was added in a Whole Foods store in Brooklyn The chief selling points of indoor vertical farmgrown fruits and vegetables are that they are pesticide and herbicidefree require only a little water and land to produce offer flexible supply dynamics have short grow cycles offer yearround production and have easy product traceability according to those interviewed for this article Grocers or producer purveyors also might be able to claim greater price certainty and a longer shelf life We look at vertical farms as a growing trend and a unique opportunity to partner with up and coming brands Whole Foods’ Manca said But some farms need to get their prices in line with traditional produce and it is becoming clear that vertical farms must start offering a wider variety of produce Many are experimenting with growing berries and vine crops such as tomatoes and cucumbers To date leafy greens microgreens and herbs have been vertical farms’ cash crops because they offer more competitive pricing due to high yields and the fact that they require less energy to grow The growing appetite for indoor growing Five Mediterranean climates — including California’s — supply all of the world’s fresh fruit and vegetables and these climates are dealing with changing weather patterns That is forcing more scrutiny of the vertical and indoor farming sectors Today the world can only grow enough fresh fruits and vegetables to feed twothirds of the global population what is required for a healthy diet Thats with 75 billion people on Earth said Christina Ra senior director of integrated marketing at Plenty the San Franciscobased indoor vertical farming company that in 2017 raised 200 million in Series B funding from Softbank Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt the former chairman of Alphabet Already there is not enough and the global population is expected to reach almost 10 billion in 2050 Ra pointed out Vertical farms alone cannot fill the gap but new technologies and innovations including more efficient LED lighting robotics machine vision and artificial intelligence are making vertical farms more efficient and productive Technology is important to reduce cost and to improve yields and quality and therefore to provide a better return on investment said Charlie Wang president and CEO of Oasis Biotech an Albuquerquebased company that owns vertical farms in Las Vegas China and Albuquerque It also develops and sells LED lights and hydroponic grow systems under SANANBIO brand During the last three years LED lighting costs have dropped considerably amid a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency Looking ahead over the next three years similar advances in energy efficiency are expected and developments in precision farming and automation are also expected to help the vertical farm industry eke out additional efficiency gains We can do precision agriculture within a precise environment said Grant Vandenbussche senior business development strategist at Fifth Season a fully automated indoor vertical farm company based in Pennsylvania This allows us to isolate variables to optimize for specific desired outcomes rapidly We know how each factor is impacting things like plant growth coloring and flavor … Its a true smart manufacturing system Operating a fullyautomated vertical farm can put a vertical farms labor cost on par with fieldgrown produce Cornell’s Mattson said We have been very forward about how energy requirements are a potential limiting factor for the industry According to Vandenbussche automation helped Fifth Season reduce its labor from 4060 percent of costs to 20 percent of costs Fifth Season also said that the energy required from its automation processes is negligible within its system Indoor vertical farms’ energy needs for lighting and HVAC are considerable however For example leafy greens grown in vertical farms in the Northeast currently have a carbon footprint that is two times higher than the carbon footprint for the same product grown in a field in California and then shipped 3000 miles across the country Mattson said There is also research and data that points to vertical farming being more energyintensive than greenhousegrown produce We have been very forward about how energy requirements are a potential limiting factor for the industry Vandenbussche said Were paying very close attention to our energy requirements as we launch our new farm and we are implementing as many energy savings solutions as possible Sourcing all of a vertical farm’s energy needs from renewable sources through local utility providers can be challenging Microgrids are an obvious alternative but for some vertical farms the initial capital cost is prohibitive For its farm Fifth Season partnered with Scale Microgrid Solutions a firm that provides turnkey microgrids on a solarmicrogrid solution They have a shared savings solution that allows you to capture the benefits of a microgrid without the upfront capital cost Vandenbussche said Another workaround could involve geothermal energy which can help control the air temperature But for indoor vertical farms the largest energy cost is electricity for lighting which geothermal cannot address Plenty of paths The indoor vertical farm industry has seen a lot of investment but the business models are still sorting themselves out There has been a big push on technology but technology might not be the differentiating factor The business models matter said Ian Copeland managing director at Ultra Capital a San Francisco and Philadelphiabased firm that focuses on small to midsize sustainable infrastructure projects in the agriculture energy waste and water sectors Investors want datarich businesses that are responding to climate change GordonSmith of Agritecture Consulting said Consumers and retailers meanwhile want produce that they can trust will be clean and local he added According to Whole Foods Market’s Manca one big driver of the vertical farming trend is people wanting to know where their food comes from Especially for people in urban areas I think that it’s really appealing to know that fresh produce is now being grown nearby and available at local stores at the peak of freshness he said When it comes to vertical farming venture capital is important but project financing is critical Oasis Biotech’s Wang said Project finance investors want to see longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparts costcompetitive products and revenue predictability are also important Thanks to our modular platform — where we build farms inside refurbish shipping containers — we can quick pop up in a new city with relatively little capital vs competitors” said Tobias Peggs cofounder and CEO of Square Roots Earlier this month Square Roots and Gordon Food Service GFS North America’s largest privately owned foodservice distributor forged a strategic partnership and opened its first colocated farm at GFS’ headquarters in Michigan First we want to refine and evaluate the proof of concept at the colocated headquarters farm Assuming that we meet or exceed the projections going in we hope to begin adding more locations next year said Sean Walsh GFS’s director of North America category management GFS trucks food to more than 100000 restaurants schools hospitalshealthcare facilities cruise ships and summer camp customers in the eastern half of the United States and Canada GFS also runs a regional network of stores that service small businesses caterers and walkin consumers Other indoor farming companies are also in an expansionary mode For example Gotham Greens which operates five hightech greenhouse farms in New York City and Chicago is opening new locations in Providence Rhode Island Chicago and Baltimore in the coming months It says its retail presence will have grown to about 2000 retail doors by the end of this year And in late October Plenty which concentrates on the West Coast announced plans for a farm in the heart of Los Angeles The new facility will create about 50 local jobs ranging

conductivity between the two These work OK at first but eventually start to oxidize because of the exposed metal Even if theyre gold plated The resistivity measurement goes up and up so you constantly have to recalibrate your code Also resistive measurements dont always work in loose soil This design is superior with a capacitive measurement Capacitive measurements use only one probe dont have any exposed metal and dont introduce any DC currents into your plants We use the built in capacitive touch measurement system built into the ATSAMD10 chip which will give you a reading ranging from about 200 very dry to 2000 very wet As a bonus we also give you the ambient temperature from the internal temperature sensor on the microcontroller its not high precision maybe good to or 2 degrees Celsius To make it so you can use the sensor with just about any microcontroller we have an I2C interface Connect a 4pin JSTPH cable we have a few stocked to your microcontroller or single board computer to 35V power Ground I2C SDA and I2C SCL and then run our Arduino or CircuitPython code to read the temperature and capacitive measurement No soldering required Please note This is just the sensor youll also need a JST 4PH cable to go along for plugging it in We have a few options such as one with male header pins female header pins and a JSTJST cable You can use Seeed Grove cables and boards to connect the Grove cable is a little different looking but will fit just fine Check out the full guide for schematics wiring code and more Technical Details Revision History As on Jan 7 2020 Weve

Imre Vass Conference paper 5 Citations 728 Downloads Part of the Nato Science Series IV Earth and Environmental Sciences book series NAIV volume 57 1 Abstract Ultraviolet radiation is a well known damaging factor of plant photosynthesis Here we studied the mechanism of damage induced by the UVB and UVA spectral regions to the light energy converting Photosystem II PSII complex which is the origin of electron flow for the whole photosynthetic process Our results show that the primary UV damage occurs at the catalytic Mn cluster of water oxidation which is most likely sensitized by the UV absorption of MnIII and MnIV ions ligated by organic residues The presence of visible light enhances the photodamage of PSII but has no synergistic interaction with UV radiation UVinduced damage of PSII can be repaired via de novo synthesis of the D1 and D2 reaction center protein subunits This process is facilitated by low intensity visible light which thereby can protect against UVinduced damage However the photodamage induced by visible light at high intensity above 1000 µEm −2 s −1 cancels the protective effect The protein repair of PSII is also retarded by the lack of DNA repair as shown in a photolyase deficient cyanobacterial mutant Keywords Visible Light Oxygen Evolution Water Oxidation PSII Complex Inactivation Curve These keywords were added by machine and not by the

October 20 2019 View fullsize To View The Video Please Click Here ROSA WOODSSTUFF Shoots Microgreens is one of NZs first vertical farms housed in a former nightclub Once nightclub goers used to bounce off the walls of a Wellington basement but now its been transformed into an urban market garden supplying over 80 restaurants The lights are still there but the moody blues have been replaced by stateoftheart multi coloured LED grow lights Shoots Microgreens is a startup company growing tiny crops mainly for restaurants but with some of the produce sold through stores such as Moore Wilson Microgreens are the intense flavoured first shoots and leaves and are popular among chefs and bartenders for garnishing meals and cocktails Many familiar leaves can be used as microgreens including mustard basil rocket and coriander Coowner Matt Keltie started the business last year and it now employs three fulltime workers although it is yet to make a profit While ostensibly a hydroponicstyle system Shoots Microgreens is marketing itself as different to such common garden businesses that have been around for decades View fullsize ROSA WOODSSTUFF Shoots Microgreens coowner Matt Keltie has started a business in a former Wellington nightclub First the location vertical farms have sprung up in a number of major urban centres where the crops are grown close to where people consume them – in high rises derelict buildings and abandoned warehouses – reducing carbon emissions and maximising unused spaces in cities Its all about using an efficient production area recycling water and having a lower carbon footprint Secondly the crops are grown without the need to cart in soil and spray the chemicals that conventional growers use to control animal pests fungal diseases and weeds Thirdly everything is recycled including the water and growing trays and deliveries are made using ebikes Keltie started the business in a garage before moving into a smaller space than where he is now Once he had successfully realised the proof of concept and started to supply restaurants he had enough confidence to launch the business The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority Eeca helped with a 12300 investment in the special LED grow lights under its Gen Less campaign View fullsize Ray McGregor delivers microgreens for company Shoots Microgreens on an ebike SUPPLIED Compared with traditional incandescent hydroponic lamps the LEDs are cool to the touch and can be frequency controlled to improve productivity – they grow the shoots around twice as fast as their halogen counterparts The LEDs conserve 45 percent more lighting electricity saving Kelties business about 25000 a year on its power bill With customisable spectrums of light the colour of LEDs can be adjusted to optimise the growth of each specific variety of microgreens As they do not produce heat they can be stacked at every vertical layer with no risk of heat damaging plants as with incandescent hydroponic lamps Every day chefs order their microgreens and are delivered or collected The nonsoil medium the plants are grown in is a trade secret although Keltie is planning on moving to a hempbased medium once it becomes available Keltie says the taste of the microgreens is governed by the light applied to the plants – the lights are one component but managing and changing alone or all components of the growing system influences the plants When I take two trays of the same plants grown under different numbers of bulbs some chefs can tell me how theyve been grown because theres a subtle difference in flavour Its all about the mix of water and lights Not only do the LEDs provide the right growing spectrums they are hellishly efficient in terms of power A supplier provides the fertiliser in the right sorts of ratios but Keltie is starting to test which plants take up which nutrients so he can apply a specific rather than a broad spectrum mix For example peas do not require much nitrogen View fullsize ROSA WOODSSTUFF Microgreens are used as garnishes or in cocktails He admits there has been a lot of trial and error in the startup period When people say how far down the track are you with your learning I say about 5 per cent Ive still got a solid 95 percent left to learn But we hope to start soon in Auckland once weve ironed out the issues here Prices start at 725 for a tray of peas which grow in a little over a week whereas slower growing red sorrel is priced accordingly higher Quotes from famous historical figures are mashed up in a call to arms for climate change campaign Gen Less encouraging New Zealanders to get more out of life by using less Capitol Restaurant ownerchef Tom Hutchison says he buys the microgreens every day Its good that theyre doing well the product is fantastic Hutchison is not so much a fan of the very young greens preferring the more mature larger leaves Eeca technology innovation manager Dinesh Chand worked with Keltie to help get the project off the ground This project not only shows potential for LEDs to reduce electricity use and increase productivity but is a great example of reducing transportrelated emissions In this case supplying locally eliminates the equivalent annual carbon emissions of taking 20 cars off the road View fullsize GETTYIMAGES In London microgreens are grown in old air raid shelters beneath some of the capitals busiest streets Vertical farming can save up to six times the ground space that conventional farming uses Keltie said it was not a replacement for traditional New Zealand farming yet but was part of its future Eeca chief executive Andrew Caseley said the authoritys intention in running the Gen Less campaign was to mobilise New Zealanders to be world leaders in clean and clever energy use Companies that have already joined Gen Less include Westpac Countdown New Zealand Post Stuff Wishbone Design Ecostore Lewis Road and Ethique Less refers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy use People could join the campaign by walking their children to school switching to a more efficient car such as an EV buying sustainable goods and services and using LED bulbs he said

166,html Photosynthesis Wikipedia Photosynthesis From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Biological process to convert light into chemical energy Schematic of photosynthesis in plants The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant Overall equation for the type of photosynthesis that occurs in plants Composite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis including both oceanic phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation Dark red and bluegreen indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land respectively Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that through cellular respiration can later be released to fuel the organisms metabolic activities This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules such as sugars which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis from the Greek phōs φῶς light and sunthesis σύνθεσις putting together 1 2 3 In most cases oxygen is also released as a waste product Most plants algae and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis such organisms are called photoautotrophs Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earths atmosphere and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth 4 Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll pigments In plants these proteins are held inside organelles called chloroplasts which are most abundant in leaf cells while in bacteria they are embedded in the plasma membrane In these lightdependent reactions some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances such as water producing oxygen gas The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as shortterm stores of energy enabling its transfer to drive other reactions these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH and adenosine triphosphate ATP the energy currency of cells In plants algae and cyanobacteria longterm energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of lightindependent reactions called the Calvin cycle In the Calvin cycle atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds such as ribulose bisphosphate RuBP 5 Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the lightdependent reactions the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates such as glucose In other bacteria different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide rather than water as sources of electrons 6 Cyanobacteria appeared later the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth 7 which rendered the evolution of complex life possible Today the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts 8 9 10 which is about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization 11 Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons 91–104 petagrams of carbon into biomass per year 12 13 The phenomenon that plants receive some energy from light – in addition to air soil and water – was first discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz Contents 1 Overview 2 Photosynthetic membranes and organelles 3 Lightdependent reactions 31 Z scheme 32 Water photolysis 4

sunlight into chemical energy splits water to liberate O 2 and fixes CO 2 into sugar Photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light However not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis photoheterotrophs use organic compounds rather than carbon dioxide as a source of carbon 4 In plants algae and cyanobacteria photosynthesis releases oxygen This is called oxygenic photosynthesis and is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants algae and cyanobacteria the overall process is quite similar in these organisms There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis used mostly by certain types of bacteria which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrate Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction In general outline photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrate or other nutrients to carbon dioxide Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates amino acids and fatty acids These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water and to release chemical energy to drive the organisms metabolism Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is therefore 14 CO 2 carbon dioxide 2H 2 A electron donor photons light energy → CH 2 O carbohydrate 2A oxidized electron donor H 2 O water Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis the equation for this process is CO 2 carbon dioxide 2H 2 O water photons light energy → CH 2 O carbohydrate O 2 oxygen H 2 O water This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the lightdependent reaction and a product of the lightindependent reaction but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation CO 2 carbon dioxide H 2 O water photons light energy → CH 2 O carbohydrate O 2 oxygen Other processes substitute other compounds such as arsenite for water in the electronsupply role for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate 15 The equation for this reaction is CO 2 carbon dioxide AsO 3− 3 arsenite photons light energy → AsO 3− 4 arsenate CO carbon monoxide used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions 16 Photosynthesis occurs in two stages In the first stage lightdependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energystorage molecules ATP and NADPH During the second stage the lightindependent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide Most organisms that utilize oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the lightdependent reactions although at least three use shortwave infrared or more specifically farred radiation 17 Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis Some archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight acting as a proton pump This produces a proton gradient more directly which is then converted to chemical energy The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis 18 19 Photosynthetic membranes and organelles Main articles Chloroplast and Thylakoid Chloroplast ultrastructure outer membrane intermembrane space inner membrane 123 envelope stroma aqueous fluid thylakoid lumen inside of thylakoid thylakoid membrane granum stack of thylakoids thylakoid lamella starch ribosome plastidial DNA plastoglobule drop of lipids In photosynthetic bacteria the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes In its simplest form this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself 20 However the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids 21 or bunched up into round vesicles called intracytoplasmic membranes 22 These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb 21 In plants and algae photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane a phospholipid outer membrane and an intermembrane space Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids grana which are the site of photosynthesis The thylakoids appear as flattened disks The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic system Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color Besides chlorophyll plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls 23 Algae also use chlorophyll but various other pigments are present such as phycocyanin carotenes and xanthophylls in green algae phycoerythrin in red algae rhodophytes and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins In such proteins the pigments are arranged to work together Such a combination of proteins is also called a lightharvesting complex 24 Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity such as many Euphorbia and cactus species have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf called the mesophyll can contain between 450000 and 800000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf The surface of the leaf is coated with a waterresistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to reduce heating The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place Lightdependent reactions Main article Lightdependent reactions Lightdependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane In the lightdependent reactions one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin which passes the electron to a quinone molecule starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH In addition this creates a proton gradient energy gradient across the chloroplast membrane which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis which releases a dioxygen O 2 molecule as a waste product The overall equation for the lightdependent reactions under the conditions of noncyclic electron flow in green plants is 25 2 H 2 O 2 NADP 3 ADP 3 P i light → 2 NADPH 2 H 3 ATP O 2 Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present For example in green plants the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violetblue and red light In red algae the action spectrum is bluegreen light which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths red light used by aboveground green plants The nonabsorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color eg green plants red algae purple bacteria and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms Z scheme The Z scheme In plants lightdependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH The lightdependent reactions are of two forms cyclic and noncyclic In the noncyclic reaction the photons are captured in the lightharvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments see diagram at right The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center That freed electron is transferred to the primary electronacceptor molecule pheophytin As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain the socalled Zscheme shown in the diagram it initially functions to generate a chemiosmotic potential by pumping proton cations H across the membrane and into the thylakoid space An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Zscheme The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem The electron is then passed along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen The electron is eventually used to reduce the coenzyme NADP with a H to NADPH which has functions in the lightindependent reaction at that point the path of that electron ends The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the noncyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP and no reduced NADP NADPH is created The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I from where it was emitted hence the name cyclic reaction Water photolysis Main articles Photodissociation and Oxygen evolution Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized Elevating another electron will first require rereduction of the reaction center The excited electrons lost from the reaction center P700 of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem II Photosystem II as the first step of the Zscheme requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center called P680 The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive chargeseparation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions The electrons yielded are transferred to a redoxactive tyrosine residue that then reduces the oxidized P680 This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photodissociated electron The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redoxactive structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion this oxygenevolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the wateroxidizing reaction Dolais Sstate diagrams Photosystem II is the only known biological enzyme that carries out this oxidation of water The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis Oxygen is a waste product of lightdependent reactions but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for cellular respiration including photosynthetic organisms 26 27 Lightindependent reactions Calvin cycle Main articles Lightindependent reactions and Carbon fixation In the lightindependent or dark reactions the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO 2 from the atmosphere and in a process called the Calvin cycle it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases threecarbon sugars which are later combined to form sucrose and starch The overall equation for the lightindependent reactions in green plants is 25 128 3 CO 2 9 ATP 6 NADPH 6 H → C 3 H 6 O 3 phosphate 9 ADP 8 P i 6 NADP 3 H 2 O Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation Carbon fixation produces the intermediate threecarbon sugar product which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic compounds such as the building material cellulose the precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis or as a fuel in cellular respiration The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the energy from plants is passed through a food chain The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a fivecarbon sugar ribulose 15bisphosphate to yield two molecules of a threecarbon compound glycerate 3phosphate also known as 3phosphoglycerate Glycerate 3phosphate in the presence of ATP and NADPH produced during the lightdependent stages is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3phosphate This product is also referred to as 3phosphoglyceraldehyde PGAL or more generically as triose phosphate Most 5 out of 6 molecules of the glyceraldehyde 3phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 15bisphosphate so the process can continue The triose phosphates not thus recycled often condense to form hexose phosphates which ultimately yield sucrose starch and cellulose The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids Carbon concentrating mechanisms On land Main articles C4 carbon fixation CAM photosynthesis and Alarm photosynthesis Overview of C4 carbon fixation In hot and dry conditions plants close their stomata to prevent water loss Under these conditions CO 2 will decrease and oxygen gas produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis will increase causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose15bisphosphate carboxylaseoxygenase and decrease in carbon fixation Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the CO 2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions 28 Plants that use the C 4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the threecarbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate PEP a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase creating the fourcarbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located and where CO 2 released by decarboxylation of the fourcarbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the threecarbon 3phosphoglyceric acids The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygengenerating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO 2 fixation and thus the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf 29 C 4 plants can produce more sugar than C 3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature Many important crop plants are C 4 plants including maize sorghum sugarcane and millet Plants that do not use PEPcarboxylase in carbon fixation are called C 3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction catalyzed by RuBisCO produces the threecarbon 3phosphoglyceric acids directly in the CalvinBenson cycle Over 90 of plants use C 3 carbon fixation compared to 3 that use C 4 carbon fixation 30 however the evolution of C 4 in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution 28 Xerophytes such as cacti and most succulents also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism CAM In contrast to C 4 metabolism which spatially separates the CO 2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle CAM temporally separates these two processes CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C 3 plants and fix the CO 2 at night when their stomata are open CAM plants store the CO 2 mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate which is then reduced to malate Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO 2 inside the leaves thus allowing carbon fixation to 3phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO Sixteen thousand species of plants use CAM 31 Calcium oxalate accumulating plants such as Amaranthus hybridus and Colobanthus quitensis showed a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools supplying carbon dioxide CO 2 to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed This process was named Alarm photosynthesis Under stress conditions eg water deficit oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO 2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme and the produced CO 2 can support the Calvin cycle reactions Reactive hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction can be neutralized by catalase Alarm photosynthesis represents an unknown photosynthetic variation to be added to the already known C4 and CAM pathways However alarm photosynthesis in contrast to these pathways operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior or from the soil and not from the atmosphere 32 33 In water Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes which increase the concentration of CO 2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis An enzyme carbonic anhydrase located within the carboxysome releases CO 2 from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions HCO − 3 Before the CO 2 diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO which is concentrated within the carboxysomes HCO − 3 ions are made from CO 2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged and within the cytosol they turn back into CO 2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase This causes the HCO − 3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes 34 Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate CO 2 around RuBisCO 35 Order and kinetics The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages 13 Stage Description Time scale 1 Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll thylakoid membranes femtosecond to picosecond 2 Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions thylakoid membranes picosecond to nanosecond 3 Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis thylakoid membranes microsecond to millisecond 4 Carbon fixation and export of stable products millisecond to second Efficiency Main article Photosynthetic efficiency Plants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 3–6 36 Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat with a small fraction 1–2 37 reemitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer redder wavelengths This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers 37 Actual plants photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted light intensity temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and can vary from 01 to 8 38 By comparison solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 6–20 for massproduced panels and above 40 in laboratory devices The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured but the relationship between the two can be complex 39 For example the ATP and NADPH energy molecules created by the light reaction can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C 3 plants 39 Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks 40 41 42 For this reason it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under nonphotorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions 43 44 45 Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction and Infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction 46 It is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system or by using two separate systems together 47 Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO 2 and of ΔH 2 O using reliable methods 48 CO 2 is commonly measured in μmolsm 2 s parts per million or volume per million and H 2 O is commonly measured in mmolm 2 s or in mbars 48 By measuring CO 2 assimilation ΔH 2 O leaf temperature barometric pressure leaf area and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR it becomes possible to estimate A or carbon assimilation E or transpiration gs or stomatal conductance and Ci or intracellular CO 2 48 However it is more common to used chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement where appropriate because the most commonly used measuring parameters FVFM and YII or FFM can be made in a few seconds allowing the measurement of larger plant populations 45 Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO 2 levels above and below ambient allow the common practice of measurement of ACi curves at different CO 2 levels to characterize a plants photosynthetic response 48 Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms 46 47 While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci or substomatal CO 2 levels the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of C C to replace Ci 47 49 The estimation of CO 2 at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast or C C becomes possible with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or g m using an integrated system 46 47 50 Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf But analysis of chlorophyllfluorescence P700 and P515absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about eg the photosystems quantum efficiency and the CO 2 assimilation rates With some instruments even wavelengthdependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed 51 A phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly In the photosynthetic cell of an algae bacterium or plant there are lightsensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antennashaped structure named a photocomplex When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cells metabolism The excitons wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously allowing it to instantaneously choose the most efficient route where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur it is only possible over very short distances due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic hop The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks 52 53 54 Evolution Main

those in green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria are thought to have been anoxygenic and used various other molecules than water as electron donors Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron donors Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as an electron donor Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earths early atmosphere was highly reducing at that time 55 Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 34 billion years old 56 57 More recent studies reported in March 2018 also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 34 billion years ago 58 59 The main source of oxygen in the Earths atmosphere derives from oxygenic photosynthesis and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis such as that in cyanobacteria became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around 2 billion years ago Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor which is oxidized to molecular oxygen O 2 in the photosynthetic reaction center Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts Plant cells with visible chloroplasts from a moss Plagiomnium affine Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae These are most common in corals sponges and sea anemones It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes 60 In addition a few marine mollusks Elysia viridis and Elysia chlorotica also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies see Kleptoplasty This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time 61 62 Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive 63 An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria including a circular chromosome prokaryotictype ribosome and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center 64 65 The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired by endocytosis by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells Therefore chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells Like mitochondria chloroplasts possess their own DNA separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in cyanobacteria 66 DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers The CoRR Hypothesis proposes that this colocation of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles 67 Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages Symbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded The glaucophytes and the red and

through primary endosymbiosis in two separate events by engulfing a cyanobacterium The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin and are referred to as the red lineages and the green lineages While able to perform photosynthesis many of them are mixotrophs and practice heterotrophy to various degrees Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria formerly called bluegreen algae which are the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earths history at least 2450–2320 million years ago Ma and it is speculated much earlier 68 69 Because the Earths atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen 70 Available evidence from geobiological studies of Archean 2500 Ma sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 Ma but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma revealing an alreadydiverse biota of Cyanobacteria Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon 2500–543 Ma in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation citation needed Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic but it was only with the Mesozoic 251–66 Ma radiations of dinoflagellates coccolithophorids and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres as agents of biological nitrogen fixation and in modified form as the plastids of marine algae 71 Discovery Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century Portrait of Jan Baptist van Helmont by Mary Beale c1674 Jan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil used by a plant and the mass of the plant as it grew After noticing that the soil mass changed very little he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water the only substance he added to the potted plant His hypothesis was partially accurate – much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as water However this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plants biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis not the soil itself Joseph Priestley a chemist and minister discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it which gave off CO 2 the candle would burn out very quickly much before it ran out of wax He further discovered that a mouse could similarly injure air He then showed that the air that had been injured by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant 72 In 1779 Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestleys experiments He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours 72 73 In 1796 Jean Senebier a Swiss pastor botanist and naturalist demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light Soon afterward NicolasThéodore de Saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO 2 but also to the incorporation of water Thus the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food such as glucose was outlined 74 Cornelis Van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a lightdependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces donates its – electron to carbon dioxide Robert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light With the red alone the light reactions were suppressed When blue and red were combined the output was much more substantial Thus there were two photosystems one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths the other up to 700 nm The former is known as PSII the latter is PSI PSI contains only chlorophyll a PSII contains primarily chlorophyll a with most of the available chlorophyll b among other pigments These include phycobilins which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII system which in turn powers the photochemistry 13 Robert Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate to cytochrome b 6 now a plastoquinone another is from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrategenerating mechanisms These are linked by plastoquinone which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient reductant Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939 He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light The Hill reaction 75 is as follows 2 H 2 O 2 A light chloroplasts → 2 AH 2 O 2 where A is the electron acceptor Therefore in light the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water Melvin Calvin works in his photosynthesis laboratory Melvin Calvin and Andrew Benson along with James Bassham elucidated the path of carbon assimilation the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle in plants The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle which ignores the contribution of Bassham and Benson Many scientists refer to the cycle as the CalvinBenson Cycle BensonCalvin and some even call it the CalvinBensonBassham or CBB Cycle Nobel Prize winning scientist Rudolph A Marcus was able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain Otto Heinrich Warburg and Dean Burk discovered the Iquantum photosynthesis reaction that splits the CO 2 activated by the respiration 76 In 1950 first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation in vivo was presented by Otto Kandler using intact Chlorella cells and interpreting his findings as lightdependent ATP formation 77 In 1954 Daniel I Arnon et al discovered photophosphorylation in vitro in isolated chloroplasts with the help of P 32 78 79 Louis NM Duysens and Jan Amesz discovered that chlorophyll a will absorb one light oxidize cytochrome f chlorophyll a and other pigments will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome stating the two light reactions are in series Development of the concept In 1893 Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms photosyntax and photosynthesis for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid in the presence of chlorophyll under the influence of light Over time the term photosynthesis came into common usage as the term of choice Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term 80 C3 C4 photosynthesis research After WWII at late 1940 at the University of California Berkeley the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin Andrew Benson James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques 81 The pathway of CO 2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a 3 carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid PGA For that original and groundbreaking work a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961 In parallel plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol CO 2 ·m −2 ·s −1 with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants having the same photosynthetic capacities that were light saturated at less than 50 of sunlight 82 83 Later in 1958–1963 at Cornell University field grown maize was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO 2 ·m −2 ·s −1 and was not saturated at near full sunlight 84 85 This higher rate in maize was almost double those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants At the University of Arizona detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of monocot and dicot uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species 86 87 In tropical grasses including maize sorghum sugarcane Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO 2 ·m −2 ·s −1 and the leaves have two types of green cells i e outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane 88 Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration very low CO 2 compensation point high optimum temperature high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light 89 The research at Arizona was designated Citation Classic by the ISI 1986 87 These species was later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO 2 fixation in light has 4 carbon as malate and aspartate 90 91 92 Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower as the first stable carbon compound is the 3carbon PGA At 1000 ppm CO 2 in measuring air both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol CO 2 ·m −2 ·s −1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants 86 87 Factors The leaf is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants There are three main factors affecting photosynthesis clarification needed and several corollary factors The three main are citation needed Light irradiance and wavelength Carbon dioxide concentration Temperature Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors These include the amount of light available the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis the availability of water and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis 93 Light intensity irradiance wavelength and temperature See also PI photosynthesisirradiance curve Absorbance spectra of free chlorophyll a blue and b red in a solvent The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment–protein interactions The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life 94 The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable with both time and space In the early 20th century Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity irradiance and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation At constant temperature the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance increasing as the irradiance increases but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance At low irradiance increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation At constant high irradiance the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased These two experiments illustrate several important points First it is known that in general photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature However these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation These are the lightdependent photochemical temperatureindependent stage and the lightindependent temperaturedependent stage Second Blackmans experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light Cyanobacteria which reside several meters underwater cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments To combat this problem a series of proteins with different pigments surround the reaction center This unit is called a phycobilisome clarification needed Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration Photorespiration As carbon dioxide concentrations rise the rate at which sugars are made by the lightindependent reactions increases until limited by other factors RuBisCO the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the lightindependent reactions has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide However if the carbon dioxide concentration is low RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide This process called photorespiration uses energy but does not produce sugars RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate 2 carbon instead of 3phosphoglycerate 3 carbon Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the CalvinBenson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle A high oxygenase activity therefore drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5bisphosphate and for the continuation of the CalvinBenson cycle Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration it inhibits photosynthesis Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway and only 75 of the carbon is returned to the CalvinBenson cycle as 3phosphoglycerate The reactions also produce ammonia NH 3 which is able to diffuse out of the plant leading to a loss of nitrogen A highly simplified summary is 2 glycolate ATP → 3phosphoglycerate carbon dioxide ADP NH 3 The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration since it is characterized by lightdependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide See also Environment portal Ecology portal Earth sciences portal Metabolism portal Jan Anderson scientist

Abstract Full Text InfoHistory Metrics Supplementary material DataCode Preview PDF Abstract Background Close contact with children may provide crossreactive immunity to SARsCoV2 due to more frequent prior coryzal infections from seasonal coronaviruses Alternatively close contact with children may increase risk of SARsCoV2 infection We investigated whether risk of infection with SARsCoV2 and severe outcomes differed between adults living with and without children Methods Working on behalf of NHS England we conducted a populationbased cohort study using primary care data and pseudonymouslylinked hospital and intensive care admissions and death records from patients registered in general practices representing 40 of England Using multivariable Cox regression we calculated fullyadjusted hazard ratios HR of outcomes from 1st February3rd August 2020 comparing adults living with and without children in the household Findings Among 9157814 adults ≤65 years living with children 011 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARSCoV2 infection COVID19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID19 death HR 075 95CI 062092 Living with children aged 1218 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARSCoV2 infection HR 108 95CI 103113 but not associated with other COVID19 outcomes Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from nonCOVID19 causes Among 2567671 adults 65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARSCoV2 We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure Interpretation For adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID19 outcomes These findings have implications for determining the benefitharm balance of children attending school in the COVID19 pandemic Funding This work was supported by the Medical Research Council MRV0157371 Evidence before this study We searched MEDLINE on 19th October 2020 for populationbased epidemiological studies comparing the risk of SARSCoV2 infection and COVID19 disease in people living with and without children We searched for articles published in 2020 with abstracts available and terms “children or parents or dependants AND COVID or SARSCoV2 or coronavirus AND rate or hazard or odds or risk in the title abstract or keywords 244 papers were identified for screening but none were relevant One additional study in preprint was identified on medRxiv and found a reduced risk of hospitalisation for COVID19 and a positive SARSCoV2 infection among adult healthcare workers living with children Added value of this study This is the first populationbased study to investigate whether the risk of recorded SARSCoV2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID19 differ between adults living in households with and without schoolaged children during the UK pandemic Our findings show that for adults living with children there is no evidence of an increased risk of severe COVID19 outcomes although there may be a slightly increased risk of recorded SARSCoV2 infection for workingage adults living with children aged 12 to 18 years Workingage adults living with children 0 to 11 years have a lower risk of death from COVID19 compared to adults living without children with the effect size being comparable to their lower risk of death from any cause We observed no consistent changes in risk of recorded SARSCoV2 infection and severe outcomes from COVID19 comparing periods before and after school closure Implications of all the available evidence Our results demonstrate no evidence of serious harms from COVID19 to adults in close contact with children compared to those living in households without children This has implications for determining the benefitharm balance of children attending school in the COVID19 pandemic Competing Interest Statement BG has received

OutProduces 720Acre Flat Farm by Andrea D Steffen December 23 2020 Share 19 Plenty is an agtech startup in San Francisco cofounded by Nate Storey that is reinventing farms and farming Storey who is also the company’s chief science officer says the future of farms is vertical and indoors because that way the food can grow anywhere in the world yearround and the future of farms employ robots and AI to continually improve the quality of growth for fruits vegetables and herbs Plenty does all these things and uses 95 less water and 99 less land because of it In recent years farmers on flat farms have been using new tools for making farming better or easier They’re using drones and robots to improve crop maintenance while artificial intelligence is also on the rise with over 1600 startups and total investments reaching tens of billions of dollars Plenty is one of those startups However flat farms still use a lot of water and land while a Plenty vertical farm can produce the same quantity of fruits and vegetables as a 720acre flat farm but on only 2 acres Storey said Vertical farming exists because we want to grow the world’s capacity for fresh fruits and vegetables and we know it’s necessary Plenty’s climatecontrolled indoor farm has rows of plants growing vertically hung from the ceiling There are sunmimicking LED lights shining on them robots that move them around and artificial intelligence AI managing all the variables of water temperature and light and continually learning and optimizing how to grow bigger faster better crops These futuristic features ensure every plant grows perfectly yearround The conditions are so good that the farm produces 400 times more food per acre than an outdoor flat farm Storey said 400X greater yield per acre of ground is not just an incremental improvement and using almost two orders of magnitude less water is also critical in a time of increasing environmental stress and climate uncertainty All of these are truly gamechangers but they’re not the only goals Another perk of vertical farming is locally produced food The fruits and vegetables aren’t grown 1000 miles away or more from a city instead at a warehouse nearby Meaning many transportation miles are eliminated which is useful for reducing millions of tons of yearly CO2 emissions and prices for consumers Imported fruits and vegetables are more expensive so society’s most impoverished are at an extreme nutritional disadvantage Vertical farms could solve this problem Storey said Supplychain breakdowns resulting from COVID19 and natural disruptions like this year’s California wildfires demonstrate the need for a predictable and durable supply of products can only come from vertical farming Credit Reuters Plenty’s farms grow nonGMO crops and don’t use herbicides or pesticides They recycle all water used even capturing the evaporated water in the air The flagship farm in San Francisco is using 100 renewable energy too Furthermore all the packaging is 100 recyclable made of recycled plastic and specially designed to keep the food fresh longer to reduce food waste Storey told Forbes The future will be quite remarkable And I think the size of the global fresh fruit and vegetable industry will be multiples of what it is today Plenty has already received 400 million in investment capital from SoftBank former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos It’s also struck a deal with Albertsons stores in California to supply 430 stores with fresh produce Ideally the company will branch out opening vertical farms across the country and beyond There can never be too many places graced by better food growing with a less environmental cost Here’s a TechFirst podcast about the story behind Plenty Share 19 previous post This Campsite

the Middle East Highdensity lowwater facilities – often located in the heart of major cities – could transform food production in arid climates The cropgrowing warehouse in Al Quoz Dubai run by Badia Farms Badia Farms Daniel Bardsley June 28 2018 Updated July 25 2018 June 28 2018 Updated July 25 2018 SHARE SHARE Row upon row of leafy vegetables are stacked one above the other stretching note0 into the distance as far as the eye can see note1 all inside a huge shed note2 under bright artificial lights This is the new frontier of agriculture vertical farming a system that proponents say makes best use of land and water for highvalue crop production From an old steel warehouse in Newark in the United States to a Second World War tunnel beneath London vertical farming and its bright artificial lights offer a stark contrast to the traditional earthy image of crops growing in fields The UAE is becoming a key centre for the phenomenon with the news this week that the catering arm of Emirates Airline has partnered with a Californian company Crop One to develop what has been described as the worlds largest vertical farm In a country that depends on imports for at least four fifths of its food it offers the prospect of growing more produce locally – albeit in this case for aircraft and airport lounges rather than homes and restaurants – while making best use of precious water resources Vertical farming is based on the use of hydroponics in which plants are grown using nutrient media instead of soil a technique first used in the UAE almost half a century ago and now well established locally through a number of commercial farms Emirates Hydroponics Farms for example based between Abu Dhabi and Dubai can produce one kilogram of lettuce using about 20 litres of water with water being recycled instead of draining into the soil standard farming methods might require 400 litres an astonishing amount for any country particularly a waterscarce one By controlling variables such as temperature nutrient levels and humidity growth rates are increased significantly so 18 crops per year can be produced – three times the number of standard agriculture The absence of soil – with hydroponics plants grow in media such as rock wool a fibrous substance produced from molten rock – eliminates soilborne diseases Read more on Science Gulfs first commercial vertical farm opens in Dubai Emirates to build Dh150m farming factory next to Dubai airport to feed passengers Special report The inside story of how the UAE landed its first place in space Temperature can be controlled by air conditioning allowing yearround production even in the UAE or evaporative cooling Typically hydroponics is used for leafy crops such as salad rocket and lettuce along with vine crops – among them peppers cucumbers and tomatoes In the UAE it has been used to grow even rice papayas oranges and grapes albeit on a small scale In taking hydroponics and employing it on multiple levels instead of sunlight vertical farming uses LED lights tailored to the requirements of the particular crop Artificial lights allow farms to be located anywhere including in urban environments “Theres a growing awareness that you can use hydroponics and you can use spaces that would otherwise not have a purpose like these disused tunnels under London where a vertical farm is located Vertical farms are quite topical because they dont use much space” said Professor Neil Bricklebank who has worked on hydroponics technology at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK Improvements in LED light technology have been credited with helping to promote vertical farming artificial illumination can generate all the light that a plant needs and the latest types can be located just a short distance above the crop allowing for the stacking of layers LED lights are also becoming more efficient cutting energy costs Fresh vertical farming produce will reach the customers within hours of harvest Emirates As reported by The National the newly announced US40 million Dh1469 million Emirates Flight Catering note3 facility will be located at Dubai World Central near Al Maktoum Airport and will produce 2700kg of leafy greens per day without pesticides or herbicides It will cover 130000 square feet or about 12 hectares note4 – but it is claimed that it will grow as much produce as a 364hectare note5 farm The announcement of the new farm construction of which is set to begin in November comes not long after the official opening in Dubai of what has been described as the GCCs first commercial vertical farm This 8500squarefeet facility in Al Quoz Industrial Area 1 was developed by Badia Farms and began producing leafy green vegetables in December last year before a ceremonial launch in March On a smaller scale through other operators vertical farming has been carried out in the UAE since at least 2012 New patented technologies are being promoted for use in vertical farms The USbased AeroFarms for example which created the vertical farm in the former steel facility in Newark describes its method as “aeroponic” with roots receiving water nutrients and oxygen in a mist instead of liquid This is said to use 40 per cent less water than hydroponics Although now found in countries including Japan South Korea and the Netherlands vertical farming has until now had several disadvantages according to one specialist Dr Howard Resh a Canadabased consultant who has been involved with hydroponics projects in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait among other places says that vertical farms can be “extremely costly to construct and operate” partly because of significant wage costs Also energy inputs are high thanks to lighting and temperature controls although local vertical production can reduce carbon emissions from transporting foodstuffs Dr Resh argues that the lighting in some vertical systems is not as good as in greenhouses producing poorerquality crops However he also sees positives “These vertical systems may have an advantage in a hot humid climate where greenhouse cooling cannot maintain temperatures at optimum levels In an insulated building these temperatures could be better regulated with air conditioning systems” said Dr Resh who is involved with a new vertical system that can be fully automated without the need for harvesting because the plant is sold in the growing container “It has the potential for being economically feasible for growing lettuce leafy greens and herbs” he said of his vertical farming method Updated July 25 2018 1235 PM SHARE SHARE

Your Subject Always get your VideoMic GO as close as you can to the speaking subject for the most professional result within four feet is ideal This is why professional sound recordists use a boom and you can too Just add a VC1 extension cable and a Micro Boompole which are fully compatible with VideoMic GO Avoid Hiss Use Manual Audio Recording Mode To get the best from any mic and avoid hearing hiss in quiet speaking environments it’s essential you turn OFF Auto Gain Control in your camera’s movie recording settings as well as getting the microphone close to the subject Set the audio levels manually so that your speaking subject is hitting around the 12 without going too much over This will give a good level without distortion and without the camera amplifying background noise when the subject is silent Avoid Clicks and Whirrs Use Manual Focus The focusing motor inside some affordable lenses can be surprisingly noisy and any good sensitive microphone will hear this too If you do have a noisy lens do as they do on a professional film set and focus manually for silent recordings If you must use autofocus use the VideoMic GO offcamera with a boom or tripod and a VC1 extension cable Avoid Interference Turn Camera WiFi Off All microphones including the VideoMic GO can experience interference from strong external RF fields such as very close WiFi transmitters Turning off the WiFi function of your camera whilst filming is always good practice and can help prevent any potential interference Read more VIdeoMicro VIdeoMic GO VIdeoMic VIdeoMic Pro VIdeoMic Pro VIdeoMic NTG

Style Name VideoMic GO Verified Purchase How you rate a product depends to a large extent on your expectations I read a lot of reviews on here about certain problems relating to hissing and interference from other equipment and even the cameras However this did seem to relate somewhat to the cameras rather that camcorders or at least that was my impression Likewise there was a potential wind noise problem around the cable connection point on the mike which I have a dead cat for For me the major buying point was the not having a battery because I have shot a lot of footage worrying about the battery in my mike whether I have a spare and whether they will all last the day Its also another thing to remember Anyway after my initial quick trial I have a Panasonic HDCSD900 Camcorder with which I shoot everything from concerts to Murder Mystery films I am delighted to report that all has gone well I dont get any extraneous hiss or noise and although I havent had a chance to boom test it out doors I have tried the blow test which has been good The sound quality seems fine The internal mike on my Panasonic is pretty good but when filming scenes especially outside when using a boom then a decent mike is essential This was not exceptional but was certainly adequate It means that I think that some of the extraneous noises people have been experiencing on cameras may be due to audio settings or just the way their camera operates For me and my camcorder this is just what I need Like I say its all about expectations and needs Read more 20 people found this helpful Helpful

February 2019 Style Name VideoMic GO Verified Purchase I mostly take photographs but there are a few things where video works best so I wanted an external mic to minimize interference from wind and focusing noise this mic was the right price and came well recommended I’ve found it light weight and easy to use with my Canon EOS 6D mk2 I can leave it on and it doesn’t interfere with stills photography the instructions don’t seem to tell you but if you undo the cross head screw underneath the mount see picture you can place the mic in three positions fully forward works best for me as it doesn’t get in the way when looking through the viewfinder This is not an expensive mic so dont expect studio quality sound just an improvement over the built in mic in directionality and eliminating wind and focusing noise I didn’t get the “Dead Cat” originally but found that the foam cover doesn’t do much in anything more than a light breeze get them both at once if it’s cheaper overall a good piece of kit Read more 50 out of 5 stars Light weight and good value By Philip J on 19 February 2019 I mostly take photographs but there are a few things where video works best so I wanted an external

PCs Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2017 Verified Purchase Absolutely fabulous for working with programmes such as Final Cut Pro X The thunderbolt connection is a fantastic and to have a partition for sharing with PCs and also the USB3 cable for alternative connection is superb It will be used as a working drive and not mainly for storage Regular hard drives will be used for storing finished projects I just hope that the integrated thunderbolt lead will stand up to regular connecting and disconnecting as I jump between MiniMac and MacAir Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Report abuse Weatherguesser 50 out of 5 stars Has completely rejuvenated my mid2011 iMac its like having a new computer Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2017 Verified Purchase This device has completely rejuvenated my mid2011 iMac Having installed the operating system onto the SSD the iMac boots in about 40 seconds compared to about 4 minutes when it was running off the internal hard drive Its like having a new computer and the applications open almost instantaneously too The spinning beachball indicating a hanging program is now a thing of the past I cannot recommend this SSD enough for this reason But it must be pointed out that it wont do the same for every machine only if the computer has a Thunderbolt connection For anyone wanting to do the same as me I recommend the Twelve South BackPack for iMac httpswwwamazoncoukdpB00C1C1WU2refcmcrrypprdttlsol4 which though rather expensive provides a very neat solution for stowing the SSD I use my iMac as a TV quite a lot

directive dated 20 December 1941 addressed to newly appointed commanders in Montenegro Major Đorđije Lašić and Captain Pavle Đurišić outlined among other things the cleansing of all nonSerb elements in order to create a Greater Serbia 91 The struggle for the liberty of our whole nation under the scepter of His Majesty King Peter II the creation of a Great Yugoslavia and within it of a Great Serbia which is to be ethnically pure and is to include Serbia Montenegro Bosnia and Herzegovina Srijem the Banat and Bačka the struggle for the inclusion into Yugoslavia of all still unliberated

Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina — Directive of 20 December 1941 91 Chetniks in Šumadija kill a Partisan through heart extraction The Chetniks systemically massacred Muslims in villages that they captured 92 In late autumn of 1941 the Italians handed over the towns of Višegrad Goražde Foča and the surrounding areas in southeast Bosnia to the Chetniks to run as a puppet administration and NDH forces were compelled by the Italians to withdraw from there After the Chetniks gained control of Goražde on 29 November 1941 they began a massacre of Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials that became a systematic massacre of the local Muslim civilian population 93 Several hundred Muslims were murdered and their bodies were left hanging in the town or thrown into the Drina river 93 On 5 December 1941 the Chetniks received the town of Foča from the Italians and proceeded to massacre around 500 Muslims 93 Additional massacres against the Muslims in the area of Foča took place in August 1942 In total more than 2000 people were killed in Foča 94 In early January Chetniks entered Srebrenica and killed around 1000 Muslim civilians there and in nearby villages Around the same time the Chetniks made their way to Višegrad where deaths were reportedly in the thousands 95 Massacres continued in the following months in the region 96 In the village of Žepa alone about three hundred were killed in late 1941 96 In early January Chetniks massacred fiftyfour Muslims in Čelebić and burned down the village On 3 March Chetniks burned fortytwo Muslim villagers to death in Drakan 95 In early January 1943 and again in early February Montenegrin Chetnik units were ordered to carry out cleansing actions against Muslims first in the Bijelo Polje county in Sandžak and then in February in the Čajniče county and part of Foča county in southeastern Bosnia and in part of the Pljevlja county in Sandžak 97 Pavle Đurišić the officer in charge of these operations reported to Mihailović Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command that on 10 January 1943 thirtythree Muslim villages had been burned down and 400 Muslim fighters members of the Muslim selfprotection militia supported by the Italians and about 1000 women and children had been killed as against 14 Chetnik dead and 26 wounded 97 In another report sent by Đurišić dated 13 February 1943 he reported that Chetniks killed about 1200 Muslim fighters and about 8000 old people women and children Chetnik losses in the action were 22 killed and 32 wounded 97 He added that during the operation the total destruction of the Muslim inhabitants was carried out regardless of sex and age 98 The total number of deaths caused by the antiMuslim operations between January and February 1943 is estimated at 10000 97 The casualty rate would have been higher had a great number of Muslims not already fled the area most to Sarajevo when the February action began 97 According to a statement from the Chetnik Supreme Command from 24 February 1943 these were countermeasures taken against Muslim aggressive activities however all circumstances show that these massacres were committed in accordance with implementing the directive of 20 December 1941 94 Actions against the Croats were of a smaller scale but comparable in action 99 In early October 1942 in the village of Gata where an estimated 100 people were killed and many homes burnt in reprisal taken for the destruction of roads in the area carried out on the Italians account 94 That same month formations under the command of Petar Baćović and Dobroslav Jevđević who were

older Seventeen villages were burned to the ground 100 Mario Roatta commander of the Italian Second Army objected to these massive slaughters of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end 100 Crimes perpetrated by the Ustashas edit The Ustaša intended to create an ethnically pure Greater Croatia and they viewed those Serbs then living in Croatia Bosnia and Herzegovina as the biggest obstacle to this goal Ustasha ministers Mile Budak Mirko Puk and Milovan Žanić declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustasha policy was an ethnically pure Croatia The strategy to achieve their goal was 101 102 Onethird of the Serbs were to be killed Onethird of the Serbs were to be expelled Onethird of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to Catholicism The Independent State of Croatia government cooperated with Nazi Germany in the Holocaust and exercised their own version of the genocide against Serbs as well as Jews and Gypsies Roma aka gypsies inside its borders State policy towards Serbs had first been declared in the words of Milovan Žanić a minister of the NDH Legislative council on 2 May 1941 Ustaša soldiers sawing off the head of Branko Jungić an ethnic Serb near Bosanska Gradiška This country can only be a Croatian country and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given the opportunity 103 According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center citing the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust Ustasa terrorists killed 500000 Serbs expelled 250000 and forced 250000 to convert to Roman Catholicism They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies 104 The execution methods used by the Ustasha were particularly brutal and sadistic and often included torture dismemberment or decapitation 105 A Gestapo report to Heinrich Himmler from 1942 stated The Ustaše committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age but especially against helpless old people women and children 106 Numerous concentration camps were built in the NDH most notably Jasenovac the largest where around 100000 Serbs Jews Roma as well as a number of Croatian political dissidents died mostly from torture and starvation 107 It was established in August 1941 and not dismantled until April 1945 shortly before the end of the war Jasenovac was a complex of five subcamps and three smaller camps spread out over 240 square kilometers 93 sq mi in relatively close proximity to each other on the bank of the Sava river 108 Most of the camp was at Jasenovac about 100 km 62 mi southeast of Zagreb The complex also included large grounds at Donja Gradina directly across the Sava River the Jastrebarsko childrens camp to the northwest and the Stara Gradiška camp Jasenovac V for women and children to the southeast citation needed Unlike Nazi camps most murders at Jasenovac were done manually using hammers axes knives and other implements 109 According to testimony on the night of August 29 1942 guards at the camp organized a competition to see who could slaughter the most inmates with guard and former Franciscan priest Petar Brzica winning by cutting the throats of 1360 inmates 109 A special knife called a Srbosjek Serbcutter was designed for the slaughtering of prisoners 110 Prisoners were sometimes tied with barbed wire then taken to a ramp near to the Sava River where weights were placed on the wires their throats and stomachs slashed before their bodies were dumped into the river 109 After unsuccessful experiments with gas vans camp commander Vjekoslav Luburić had a gas chamber built at Jasenovac V where a considerable number of inmates were killed during a threemonth experiment with sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B but this method was abandoned due to poor construction 111 The Ustashe cremated living inmates as well as corpses 112 113 Other methods of torture and killing done included inserting hot nails under finger nails mutilating parts of the body including plucking out eyeballs tightening chains around ones head until the skull fractured and the eyes popped and also placing salt in open wounds 114 Women were subjected to rape and torture 115 including breast mutilation 116 Pregnant women had their wombs cut out 117 An escape attempt on 22 April 1945 by 600 male inmates failed and only 84 male prisoners escaped successfully 118 The remainder and about 400 other prisoners were then murdered by Ustasha guards despite the fact that they knew the war was ending with Germanys capitulation 119 All the female inmates from the womens camp more than 700 had been massacred by the guards the previous day 119 The guards then destroyed the camp and everything associated with it was burned to the ground 119 Other concentration camps were the Đakovo camp Gospić camp Jadovno camp Kruščica camp and the Lepoglava camp Ustasha militias and death squads also burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian Serbs in the countryside in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools Men women children were hacked to death thrown alive into pits and down ravines or set on fire in churches 120 Some Serb villages near Srebrenica and Ozren were wholly massacred while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between Vlasenica and Kladanj 121 The Glina massacres where thousands of Serbs were killed are among the more notable instances of Ustasha cruelty Ante Pavelić leader of the Ustasha fled to Argentina and Spain which gave him protection and was never extradited to stand trial for his war crimes Pavelić died on 28 December 1959 at the Hospital Alemán in Madrid where the Roman Catholic church had helped him to gain asylum at the age of 70 from gunshot wounds sustained in an earlier assassination attempt by Montenegrin Blagoje Jovović 122 Some other prominent Ustashe figures and their respective fates Andrija Artuković Croatian Minister of Interior Died in Croatian custody Mile Budak Croatian politician and chief Ustashe ideologist Tried and executed by Yugoslav authorities Petar Brzica Franciscan friar

Murdered in Spain Dinko Šakić Ustashe commander of Jasenovac Fled to Argentina extradited to Croatia for trial in 1998 Sentenced to 20 years and died in prison in 2008 Most Ustashe fled the country following the war mainly with the help of Father Krunoslav Draganović secretary of the College of Sian Girolamo who helped Ustasha fugitives immigrate illegally to South America 123 Crimes perpetrated by the Ukrainian nationalists edit The Ukrainian OUNB group along with their military force – Ukrainian Insurgent Army UPA – are responsible for a genocide on the Polish population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia Starting in March 1943 with its peak in the summer 1943 as many as 80000 100000 Although the main target were Poles many Jews Czechs and those Ukrainians unwilling to participate in the crimes were massacred as well Lacking good armament and ammunition UPA members commonly used tools such as axes and pitchforks for the slaughter As a result of these massacres almost the entire nonUkrainian population of Volhynia was either killed or forced to flee However the premix of this ethnic cleansing was the war of Polish partisan Homeland Army against Ukraine in which Poland wanted to reoccupy Western Ukraine treacherously captured in 1921 Homeland Army committed a genocide of Ukrainians during this conquest campaign killed as many as 15000 mostly in nearborder villages and practiced unprecedented cruelty against UPA partisans UPA commanders responsible for the genocide Roman Shukhevych general of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army As a leader of the UPA he was to be aware and to approve the project of ethnic cleansing in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia Dmytro Klyachkivsky colonel of the UPA He gave the order to wipe out an entire Polish male population between 16 and 60 years old according to the research of the Ukrainian historians this citation may be falsified by the Soviet intelligence Klyachkivsky is regarded as the main initiator of the massacres Mykola Lebed one of the OUN leaders and UPA fighter By the National Archives he is described as Ukrainian fascist leader and suspected Nazi collaborator Stepan Bandera leader of the OUNB His view was to remove all Poles who were hostile towards the OUN and assimilate the rest of them The role of the main architect of the massacres is often assigned to him However he was imprisoned in German concentration camp since

Eastern Congo Among the crimes alleged are mass murder rape and acts of cannibalism Yet one senior UN diplomat has indicated privately that for the sake of peace the investigation by the International Criminal Court into Bembas responsibility may be sidelined It isnt just in Congo that tradeoffs are being made Skeptics point out that those who have stood trial so far have either been defeated in

and after China builds artificial islands in South China Sea By Matt Liddy and Ben Spraggon Updated September 22 2015 124909 Map China Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says China is pushing the envelope in the South China Sea One of its controversial activities is building artificial islands in disputed regions See how reefs are being converted into military facilities Subi Reef The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative AMTI says Subi Reef is Chinas northernmost outpost in the Spratly Island group and is just 25 kilometres from civilian populations of the Philippines It says China has reclaimed almost 4 million square metres of land and is possibly preparing to build a landing strip It has already built a helipad and possibly satellite and security infrastructure In its natural state the reef was submerged at high tide Fiery Cross Reef AMTI estimates China has reclaimed nearly 3 million square metres at Fiery Cross Reef and its satellite imagery clearly shows the construction of an air strip is underway The landing strip is about 3000 metres long which would allow military aircraft to land and AMTI says port facilities under construction may be large enough to dock military tankers It says development on the reef also includes cement plants air defence guns possible gun emplacements and radar towers helipads and lighthouses Mischief Reef China is believed to have begun land reclamation at Mischief Reef early this year and has already reclaimed 55 million square metres China has military facilities and possible satellite communications antennas on the reef and the access channel has been widened Many have speculated that the by widening the entrance to the reef China intends to create a naval base on the reclaimed reef AMTI reports Gaven Reef China has built an artificial island measuring about 300 metres by 250 metres at Gaven Reef in the Tizard Banks A causeway links the island with a small facility that had long stood on the reef China has had a troop and supply garrison on Gaven Reef as far back as 2003 AMTI reports This has included a large supply platform where ships can dock several gun emplacements and radar and communications equipment Hughes Reef IHS Janes estimates China has built a landmass of 75000 square metres in the Spratly Islands and equipment on the site includes an antiaircraft tower Johnson South Reef Johnson South Reef is a submerged reef and has been converted into an artificial island about 400 metres wide in parts The site houses a multilevel military facility possible radar facility and a small port Cuarteron Reef Photo Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative AMTI says this reef already hosted a concrete supply platform with radar and communications equipment but China has now built an artificial island and other structures It estimates China has reclaimed 231000 square metres and built five possible communication antennas a possible radar facility two helipads and five possible gun or missile

Rehabilitation Act and Other EEO Laws What You Should Know About COVID19 and the ADA the Rehabilitation Act and Other EEO Laws Technical Assistance Questions and Answers Updated on Dec 16 2020 INTRODUCTION All EEOC materials related to COVID19 are collected at wwweeocgovcoronavirus The EEOC enforces workplace antidiscrimination laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA and the Rehabilitation Act which include the requirement for reasonable accommodation and nondiscrimination based on disability and rules about employer medical examinations and inquiries Title VII of the Civil Rights Act which prohibits discrimination based on race color national origin religion and sex including pregnancy the Age Discrimination in Employment Act which prohibits discrimination based on age 40 or older and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act Note Other federal laws as well as state or local laws may provide employees with additional protections Title I of the ADA applies to private employers with 15 or more employees It also applies to state and local government employers employment agencies and labor unions All nondiscrimination standards under Title I of the ADA also apply to federal agencies under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act Basic background information about the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is available on EEOCs disability page The EEO laws including the ADA and Rehabilitation Act continue to apply during the time of the COVID19 pandemic but they do not interfere with or prevent employers from following the guidelines and suggestions made by the CDC or statelocal public health authorities about steps employers should take regarding COVID19 Employers should remember that guidance from public health authorities is likely to change as the COVID19 pandemic evolves Therefore employers should continue to follow the most current information on maintaining workplace safety Many common workplace inquiries about the COVID19 pandemic are addressed in the CDC publication “ General Business Frequently Asked Questions ” The EEOC has provided guidance a publication entitled Pandemic Preparedness in the Workplace and the Americans With Disabilities Act PDF version Pandemic Preparedness consistent with these workplace protections and rules that can help employers implement strategies to navigate the impact of COVID19 in the workplace This pandemic publication which was written during the prior H1N1 outbreak is still relevant today and identifies established ADA and Rehabilitation Act principles to answer questions frequently asked about the workplace during a pandemic It has been updated as of March 19 2020 to address examples and information regarding COVID19 the new 2020 information appears in bold and is marked with an asterisk On March 27 2020 the EEOC provided a webinar 32720 Webinar which was recorded and transcribed and is available at wwweeocgovcoronavirus The World Health Organization WHO has declared COVID19 to be an international pandemic The EEOC pandemic publication includes a separate section that answers common employer questions about what to do after a pandemic has been declared Applying these principles to the COVID19 pandemic the following may be useful A DisabilityRelated Inquiries and Medical Exams The ADA has restrictions on when and how much medical information an employer may obtain from any applicant or employee Prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant disabilityrelated inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work provided they are required for everyone in the same job category Once an employee begins work any disabilityrelated inquiries or medical exams must be job related and consistent with business necessity A1 How much information may an employer request from an employee who calls in sick in order to protect the rest of its workforce during the COVID19 pandemic 31720 During a pandemic ADAcovered employers may ask such employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus For COVID19 these include symptoms such as fever chills cough shortness of breath or sore throat Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA A2 When screening employees entering the workplace during this time may an employer only ask employees about the COVID19 symptoms EEOC has identified as examples or may it ask about any symptoms identified by public health authorities as associated with COVID19 4920 As public health authorities and doctors learn more about COVID19 they may expand the list of associated symptoms Employers should rely on the CDC other public health authorities and reputable medical sources for guidance on emerging symptoms associated with the disease These sources may guide employers when choosing questions to ask employees to determine whether they would pose a direct threat to health in the workplace For example additional symptoms beyond fever or cough may include new loss of smell or taste as well as gastrointestinal problems such as nausea diarrhea and vomiting A3 When may an ADAcovered employer take the body temperature of employees during the COVID19 pandemic 31720 Generally measuring an employees body temperature is a medical examination Because the CDC and statelocal health authorities have acknowledged community spread of COVID19 and issued attendant precautions employers may measure employees body temperature However employers should be aware that some people with COVID19 do not have a fever A4 Does the ADA allow employers to require employees to stay home if they have symptoms of the COVID19 31720 Yes The CDC states that employees who become ill with symptoms of COVID19 should leave the workplace The ADA does not interfere with employers following this advice A5 When employees return to work does the ADA allow employers to require a doctors note certifying fitness for duty 31720 Yes Such inquiries are permitted under the ADA either because they would not be disabilityrelated or if the pandemic were truly severe they would be justified under the ADA standards for disabilityrelated inquiries of employees As a practical matter however doctors and other health care professionals may be too busy during and immediately after a pandemic outbreak to provide fitnessforduty documentation Therefore new approaches may be necessary such as reliance on local clinics to provide a form a stamp or an email to certify that an individual does not have the pandemic virus A6 May an employer administer a COVID19 test a test to detect the presence of the COVID19 virus when evaluating an employee’s initial or continued presence in the workplace 42320 updated 9820 to address stakeholder questions about updates to CDC guidance The ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be “job related and consistent with business necessity” Applying this standard to the current circumstances of the COVID19 pandemic employers may take screening steps to determine if employees entering the workplace have COVID19 because an individual with the virus will pose a direct threat to the health of others Therefore an employer may choose to administer COVID19 testing to employees before initially permitting them to enter the workplace andor periodically to determine if their presence in the workplace poses a direct threat to others The ADA does not interfere with employers following recommendations by the CDC or other public health authorities regarding whether when and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate Testing administered by employers consistent with current CDC guidance will meet the ADA’s “business necessity” standard Consistent with the ADA standard employers should ensure that the tests are considered accurate and reliable For example employers may review information from the US Food and Drug Administration about what may or may not be considered safe and accurate testing as well as guidance from CDC or other public health authorities Because the CDC and FDA may revise their recommendations based on new information it may be helpful to check these agency websites for updates Employers may wish to consider the incidence of falsepositives or falsenegatives associated with a particular test Note that a positive test result reveals that an individual most likely has a current infection and may be able to transmit the virus to others A negative test result means that the individual did not have detectable COVID19 at the time of testing A negative test does not mean the employee will not acquire the virus later Based on guidance from medical and public health authorities employers should still require–to the greatest extent possible–that employees observe infection control practices such as social distancing regular handwashing and other measures in the workplace to prevent transmission of COVID19 Note Question A6 and A8 address screening of employees generally See Question A9 regarding decisions to screen individual employees A7 CDC said in its Interim Guidelines that antibody test results “should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace” In light of this CDC guidance under the ADA may an employer require antibody testing before permitting employees to reenter the workplace 61720 No An antibody test constitutes a medical examination under the ADA In light of CDC’s Interim Guidelines that antibody test results “should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace” an antibody test at this time does not meet the ADA’s “job related and consistent with business necessity” standard for medical examinations or inquiries for current employees Therefore requiring antibody testing before allowing employees to reenter the workplace is not allowed under the ADA Please note that an antibody test is different from a test to determine if someone has an active case of COVID19 ie a viral test The EEOC has already stated that COVID19 viral tests are permissible under the ADA The EEOC will continue to closely monitor CDC’s recommendations and could update this discussion in response to changes in CDC’s recommendations A8 May employers ask all employees physically entering the workplace if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID19 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 1 Yes Employers may ask all employees who will be physically entering the workplace if they have COVID19 or symptoms associated with COVID19 and ask if they have been tested for COVID19 Symptoms associated with COVID19 include for example fever chills cough and shortness of breath The CDC has identified a current list of symptoms An employer may exclude those with COVID19 or symptoms associated with COVID19 from the workplace because as EEOC has stated their presence would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others However for those employees who are teleworking and are not physically interacting with coworkers or others for example customers the employer would generally not be permitted to ask these questions A9 May a manager ask only one employee—as opposed to asking all employees—questions designed to determine if she has COVID19 or require that this employee alone have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 3 If an employer wishes to ask only a particular employee to answer such questions or to have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing the ADA requires the employer to have a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that this person might have the disease So it is important for the employer to consider why it wishes to take these actions regarding this particular employee such as a display of COVID19 symptoms In addition the ADA does not interfere with employers following recommendations by the CDC or other public health authorities regarding whether when and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate A10 May an employer ask an employee who is physically coming into the workplace whether they have family members who have COVID19 or symptoms associated with COVID19 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 4 No The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act GINA prohibits employers from asking employees medical questions about family members GINA however does not prohibit an employer from asking employees whether they have had contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID19 or who may have symptoms associated with the disease Moreover from a public health perspective only asking an employee about his contact with family members would unnecessarily limit the information obtained about an employee’s potential exposure to COVID19 A11 What may an employer do under the ADA if an employee refuses to permit the employer to take his temperature or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID19 has symptoms associated with COVID19 or has been tested for COVID19 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 2 Under the circumstances existing currently the ADA allows an employer to bar an employee from physical presence in the workplace if he refuses to have his temperature taken or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID19 has symptoms associated with COVID19 or has been tested for COVID19 To gain the cooperation of employees however employers may wish to ask the reasons for the employee’s refusal The employer may be able to provide information or reassurance that they are taking these steps to ensure the safety of everyone in the workplace and that these steps are consistent with health screening recommendations from CDC Sometimes employees are reluctant to provide medical information because they fear an employer may widely spread such personal medical information throughout the workplace The ADA prohibits such broad disclosures Alternatively if an employee requests reasonable accommodation with respect to screening the usual accommodation process should be followed this is discussed in Question G7 A12 During the COVID19 pandemic may an employer request information from employees who work onsite whether regularly or occasionally who report feeling ill or who call in sick 9820 adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 6 Due to the COVID19 pandemic at this time employers may ask employees who work onsite whether regularly or occasionally and report feeling ill or who call in sick questions about their symptoms as part of workplace screening for COVID19 A13 May an employer ask an employee why he or she has been absent from work 9820 adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 15 Yes Asking why an individual did not report to work is not a disabilityrelated inquiry An employer is always entitled to know why an employee has not reported for work A14 When an employee returns from travel during a pandemic must an employer wait until the employee develops COVID19 symptoms to ask questions about where the person has traveled 9820 adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 8 No Questions about where a person traveled would not be disabilityrelated inquiries If the CDC or state or local public health officials recommend that people who visit specified locations remain at home for a certain period of time an employer may ask whether employees are returning from these locations even if the travel was personal B Confidentiality of Medical Information With limited exceptions the ADA requires employers to keep confidential any medical information they learn about any applicant or employee Medical information includes not only a diagnosis or treatments but also the fact that an individual has requested or is receiving a reasonable accommodation B1 May an employer store in existing medical files information it obtains related to COVID19 including the results of taking an employees temperature or the employees selfidentification as having this disease or must the employer create a new medical file system solely for this information 4920 The ADA requires that all medical information about a particular employee be stored separately from the employees personnel file thus limiting access to this confidential information An employer may store all medical information related to COVID19 in existing medical files This includes an employees statement that he has the disease or suspects he has the disease or the employers notes or other documentation from questioning an employee about symptoms B2 If an employer requires all employees to have a daily temperature check before entering the workplace may the employer maintain a log of the results 4920 Yes The employer needs to maintain the confidentiality of this information B3 May an employer disclose the name of an employee to a public health agency when it learns that the employee has COVID19 4920 Yes B4 May a temporary staffing agency or a contractor that places an employee in an employers workplace notify the employer if it learns the employee has COVID19 4920 Yes The staffing agency or contractor may notify the employer and disclose the name of the employee because the employer may need to determine if this employee had contact with anyone in the workplace B5 Suppose a manager learns that an employee has COVID19 or has symptoms associated with the disease The manager knows she must report it but is worried about violating ADA confidentiality What should she do 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 5 The ADA requires that an employer keep all medical information about employees confidential even if that information is not about a disability Clearly the information that an employee has symptoms of or a diagnosis of COVID19 is medical information But the fact that this is medical information does not prevent the manager from reporting to appropriate employer officials so that they can take actions consistent with guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities The question is really what information to report is it the fact that an employee—unnamed—has symptoms of COVID19 or a diagnosis or is it the identity of that employee Who in the organization needs to know the identity of the employee will depend on each workplace and why a specific official needs this information Employers should make every effort to limit the number of people who get to know the name of the employee The ADA does not interfere with a designated representative of the employer interviewing the employee to get a list of people with whom the employee possibly had contact through the workplace so that the employer can then take action to notify those who may have come into contact with the employee without revealing the employee’s identity For example using a generic descriptor such as telling employees that “someone at this location” or “someone on the fourth floor” has COVID19 provides notice and does not violate the ADA’s prohibition of disclosure of confidential medical information For small employers coworkers might be able to figure out who the employee is but employers in that situation are still prohibited from confirming or revealing the employee’s identity Also all employer officials who are designated as needing to know the identity of an employee should be specifically instructed that they must maintain the confidentiality of this information Employers may want to plan in advance what supervisors and managers should do if this situation arises and determine who will be responsible for receiving information and taking next steps B6 An employee who must report to the workplace knows that a coworker who reports to the same workplace has symptoms associated with COVID19 Does ADA confidentiality prevent the first employee from disclosing the coworkers symptoms to a supervisor 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 6 No ADA confidentiality does not prevent this employee from communicating to his supervisor about a coworker’s symptoms In other words it is not an ADA confidentiality violation for this employee to inform his supervisor about a coworker’s symptoms After learning about this situation the supervisor should contact appropriate management officials to report this information and discuss next steps B7 An employer knows that an employee is teleworking because the person has COVID19 or symptoms associated with the disease and that he is in selfquarantine May the employer tell staff that this particular employee is teleworking without saying why 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 7 Yes If staff need to know how to contact the employee and that the employee is working even if not present in the workplace then disclosure that the employee is teleworking without saying why is permissible Also if the employee was on leave rather than teleworking because he has COVID19 or symptoms associated with the disease or any other medical condition then an employer cannot disclose the reason for the leave just the fact that the individual is on leave B8 Many employees including managers and supervisors are now teleworking as a result of COVID19 How are they supposed to keep medical information of employees confidential while working remotely 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 9 The ADA requirement that medical information be kept confidential includes a requirement that it be stored separately from regular personnel files If a manager or supervisor receives medical information involving COVID19 or any other medical information while teleworking and is able to follow an employer’s existing confidentiality protocols while working remotely the supervisor has to do so But to the extent that is not feasible the supervisor still must safeguard this information to the greatest extent possible until the supervisor can properly store it This means that paper notepads laptops or other devices should not be left where others can access the protected information Similarly documentation must not be stored electronically where others would have access A manager may even wish to use initials or another code to further ensure confidentiality of the name of an employee C Hiring and Onboarding Under the ADA prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant disabilityrelated inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work provided they are required for everyone in the same job category C1 If an employer is hiring may it screen applicants for symptoms of COVID19 31820 Yes An employer may screen job applicants for symptoms of COVID19 after making a conditional job offer as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same type of job This ADA rule applies whether or not the applicant has a disability C2 May an employer take an applicants temperature as part of a postoffer preemployment medical exam 31820 Yes Any medical exams are permitted after an employer has made a conditional offer of employment However employers should be aware that some people with COVID19 do not have a fever C3 May an employer delay the start date of an applicant who has COVID19 or symptoms associated with it 31820 Yes According to current CDC guidance an individual who has COVID19 or symptoms associated with it should not be in the workplace C4 May an employer withdraw a job offer whe n it needs the applicant to start immediately but the individual has COVID19 or symptoms of it 31820 Based on current CDC guidance this individual cannot safely enter the workplace and therefore the employer may withdraw the job offer C5 May an employer postpone the start date or withdraw a job offer because the individual is 65 years old or pregnant both of which place them at higher risk from COVID19 4920 No The fact that the CDC has identified those who are 65 or older or pregnant women as being at greater risk does not justify unilaterally postponing the start date or withdrawing a job offer However an employer may choose to allow telework or to discuss with these individuals if they would like to postpone the start date D Reasonable Accommodation Under the ADA reasonable accommodations are adjustments or modifications provided by an employer to enable people with disabilities to enjoy equal employment opportunities If a reasonable accommodation is needed and requested by an individual with a disability to apply for a job perform a job or enjoy benefits and privileges of employment the employer must provide it unless it would pose an undue hardship meaning significant difficulty or expense An employer has the discretion to choose among effective accommodations Where a requested accommodation would result in undue hardship the employer must offer an alternative accommodation if one is available absent undue hardship In discussing accommodation requests employers and employees may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network JAN website for types of accommodations wwwaskjanorg JANs materials specific to COVID19 are at httpsaskjanorgtopicsCOVID19cfm D1 If a job may only be performed at the workplace are there reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities absent undue hardship that could offer protection to an employee who due to a preexisting disability is at higher risk from COVID19 4920 There may be reasonable accommodations that could offer protection to an individual whose disability puts him at greater risk from COVID19 and who therefore requests such actions to eliminate possible exposure Even with the constraints imposed by a pandemic some accommodations may meet an employees needs on a temporary basis without causing undue hardship on the employer Lowcost solutions achieved with materials already on hand or easily obtained may be effective If not already implemented for all employees accommodations for those who request reduced contact with others due to a disability may include changes to the work environment such as designating oneway aisles using plexiglass tables or other barriers to ensure minimum distances between customers and coworkers whenever feasible per CDC guidance or other accommodations that reduce chances of exposure Flexibility by employers and employees is important in determining if some accommodation is possible in the circumstances Temporary job restructuring of marginal job duties temporary transfers to a different position or modifying a work schedule or shift assignment may also permit an individual with a disability to perform safely the essential functions of the job while reducing exposure to others in the workplace or while commuting D2 If an employee has a preexisting mental illness or disorder that has been exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic may he now be entitled to a reasonable accommodation absent undue hardship 4920 Although many people feel significant stress due to the COVID19 pandemic employees with certain preexisting mental health conditions for example anxiety disorder obsessivecompulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder may have more difficulty handling the disruption to daily life that has accompanied the COVID19 pandemic As with any accommodation request employers may ask questions to determine whether the condition is a disability discuss with the employee how the requested accommodation would assist him and enable him to keep working explore alternative accommodations that may effectively meet his needs and request medical documentation if needed D3 In a workplace where all employees are required to telework during this time should an employer postpone discussing a request from an employee with a disability for an accommodation that will not be needed until he returns to the workplace when mandatory telework ends 4920 Not necessarily An employer may give higher priority to discussing requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed while teleworking but the employer may begin discussing this request now The employer may be able to acquire all the information it needs to make a decision If a reasonable accommodation is granted the employer also may be able to make some arrangements for the accommodation in advance D4 What if an employee was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID19 pandemic and now requests an additional or altered accommodation 4920 An employee who was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID19 pandemic may be entitled to an additional or altered accommodation absent undue hardship For example an employee who is teleworking because of the pandemic may need a different type of accommodation than what he uses in the workplace The employer may discuss with the employee whether the same or a different disability is the basis for this new request and why an additional or altered accommodation is needed D5 During the pandemic if an employee requests an accommodation for a medical condition either at home or in the workplace may an employer still request information to determine if the condition is a disability 41720 Yes if it is not obvious or already known an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee has a disability as defined by the ADA a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or a history of a substantially limiting impairment D6 During the pandemic may an employer still engage in the interactive process and request information from an employee about why an accommodation is needed 41720 Yes if it is not obvious or already known an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employees disability necessitates an accommodation either the one he requested or any other Possible questions for the employee may include 1 how the disability creates a limitation 2 how the requested accommodation will effectively address the limitation 3 whether another form of accommodation could effectively address the issue and 4 how a proposed accommodation will enable the employee to continue performing the essential functions of his position that is the fundamental job duties D7 If there is some urgency to providing an accommodation or the employer has limited time available to discuss the request during the pandemic may an employer provide a temporary accommodation 41720 Yes Given the pandemic some employers may choose to forgo or shorten the exchange of information between an employer and employee known as the interactive process discussed in D5 and D6 above and grant the request In addition when government restrictions change or are partially or fully lifted the need for accommodations may also change This may result in more requests for shortterm accommodations Employers may wish to adapt the interactive process—and devise end dates for the accommodation—to suit changing circumstances based on public health directives Whatever the reason for shortening or adapting the interactive process an employer may also choose to place an end date on the accommodation for example either a specific date such as May 30 or when the employee returns to the workplace part or fulltime due to changes in government restrictions limiting the number of people who may congregate Employers may also opt to provide a requested accommodation on an interim or trial basis with an end date while awaiting receipt of medical documentation Choosing one of these alternatives may be particularly helpful where the requested accommodation would provide protection that an employee may need because of a preexisting disability that puts her at greater risk during this pandemic This could also apply to employees who have disabilities exacerbated by the pandemic Employees may request an extension that an employer must consider particularly if current government restrictions are extended or new ones adopted D8 May an employer invite employees now to ask for reasonable accommodations they may need in the future when they are permitted to return to the workplace 41720 updated 9820 to address stakeholder questions Yes Employers may inform the workforce that employees with disabilities may request accommodations in advance that they believe they may need when the workplace reopens This is discussed in greater detail in Question G6 If advance requests are received employers may begin the interactive process – the discussion between the employer and employee focused on whether the impairment is a disability and the reasons that an accommodation is needed If an employee chooses not to request accommodation in advance and instead requests it at a later time the employer must still consider the request at that time D9 Are the circumstances of the pandemic relevant to whether a requested accommodation can be denied because it poses an undue hardship 41720 Yes An employer does not have to provide a particular reasonable accommodation if it poses an undue hardship which means significant difficulty or expense As described in the two questions that follow in some instances an accommodation that would not have posed an undue hardship prior to the pandemic may pose one now D10 What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses significant difficulty during the COVID19 pandemic 41720 An employer may consider whether current circumstances create significant difficulty in acquiring or providing certain accommodations considering the facts of the particular job and workplace For example it may be significantly more difficult in this pandemic to conduct a needs assessment or to acquire certain items and delivery may be impacted particularly for employees who may be teleworking Or it may be significantly more difficult to provide employees with temporary assignments to remove marginal functions or to readily hire temporary workers for specialized positions If a particular accommodation poses an undue hardship employers and employees should work together to determine if there may be an alternative that could be provided that does not pose such problems D11 What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses significant expense during the COVID19 pandemic 41720 Prior to the COVID19 pandemic most accommodations did not pose a significant expense when considered against an employers overall budget and resources always considering the budgetresources of the entire entity and not just its components But the sudden loss of some or all of an employers income stream because of this pandemic is a relevant consideration Also relevant is the amount of discretionary funds available at this time—when considering other expenses—and whether there is an expected date that current restrictions on an employers operations will be lifted or new restrictions will be added or substituted These considerations do not mean that an employer can reject any accommodation that costs money an employer must weigh the cost of an accommodation against its current budget while taking into account constraints created by this pandemic For example even under current circumstances there may be many nocost or very lowcost accommodations D12 Do the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to applicants or employees who are classified as “ critical infrastructure workers ” or “ essential critical workers ” by the CDC 42320 Yes These CDC designations or any other designations of certain employees do not eliminate coverage under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act or any other equal employment opportunity law Therefore employers receiving requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act from employees falling in these categories of jobs must accept and process the requests as they would for any other employee Whether the request is granted will depend on whether the worker is an individual with a disability and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be provided absent undue hardship D13 Is an employee entitled to an accommodation under the ADA in order to avoid exposing a family member who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID19 due to an underlying medical condition 61120 No Although the ADA prohibits discrimination based on association with an individual with a disability that protection is limited to disparate treatment or harassment The ADA does not require that an employer accommodate an employee without a disability based on the disabilityrelated needs of a family member or other person with whom she is associated For example an employee without a disability is not entitled under the ADA to telework as an accommodation in order to protect a family member with a disability from potential COVID19 exposure Of course an employer is free to provide such flexibilities if it chooses to do so An employer choosing to offer additional flexibilities beyond what the law requires should be careful not to engage in disparate treatment on a protected EEO basis D14 When an employer requires some or all of its employees to telework because of COVID19 or government officials require employers to shut down their facilities and have workers telework is the employer required to provide a teleworking employee with the same reasonable accommodations for disability under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that it provides to this individual in the workplace 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 20 If such a request is made the employer and employee should discuss what the employee needs and why and whether the same or a different accommodation could suffice in the home setting For example an employee may already have certain things in their home to enable them to do their job so that they do not need to have all of the accommodations that are provided in the workplace Also the undue hardship considerations might be different when evaluating a request for accommodation when teleworking rather than working in the workplace A reasonable accommodation that is feasible and does not pose an undue hardship in the workplace might pose one when considering circumstances such as the place where it is needed and the reason for telework For example the fact that the period of telework may be of a temporary or unknown duration may render certain accommodations either not feasible or an undue hardship There may also be constraints on the normal availability of items or on the ability of an employer to conduct a necessary assessment As a practical matter and in light of the circumstances that led to the need for telework employers and employees should both be creative and flexible about what can be done when an employee needs a reasonable accommodation for telework at home If possible providing interim accommodations might be appropriate while an employer discusses a request with the employee or is waiting for additional information D15 Assume that an employer grants telework to employees for the purpose of slowing or stopping the spread of COVID19 When an employer reopens the workplace and recalls employees to the worksite does the employer automatically have to grant telework as a reasonable accommodation to every employee with a disability who requests to continue this arrangement as an ADARehabilitation Act accommodation 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 21 No Any time an employee requests a reasonable accommodation the employer is entitled to understand the disabilityrelated limitation that necessitates an accommodation If there is no disabilityrelated limitation that requires teleworking then the employer does not have to provide telework as an accommodation Or if there is a disabilityrelated limitation but the employer can effectively address the need with another form of reasonable accommodation at the workplace then the employer can choose that alternative to telework To the extent that an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions then a request—after the workplace reopens—to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function The ADA never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability The fact that an employer temporarily excused performance of one or more essential functions when it closed the workplace and enabled employees to telework for the purpose of protecting their safety from COVID19 or otherwise chose to permit telework does not mean that the employer permanently changed a job’s essential functions that telework is always a feasible accommodation or that it does not pose an undue hardship These are factspecific determinations The employer has no obligation under the ADA to refrain from restoring all of an employee’s essential duties at such time as it chooses to restore the prior work arrangement and then evaluating any requests for continued or new accommodations under the usual ADA rules D16 Assume that prior to the emergence of the COVID19 pandemic an employee with a disability had requested telework as a reasonable accommodation The employee had shown a disabilityrelated need for this accommodation but the employer denied it because of concerns that the employee would not be able to perform the essential functions remotely In the past the employee therefore continued to come to the workplace However after the COVID19 crisis has subsided and temporary telework ends the employee renews her request for telework as a reasonable accommodation Can the employer again refuse the request 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 22 Assuming all the requirements for such a reasonable accommodation are satisfied the temporary telework experience could be relevant to considering the renewed request In this situation for example the period of providing telework because of the COVID19 pandemic could serve as a trial period that showed whether or not this employee with a disability could satisfactorily perform all essential functions while working remotely and the employer should consider any new requests in light of this information As with all accommodation requests the employee and the employer should engage in a flexible cooperative interactive process going forward if this issue does arise D17 Might the pandemic result in excusable delays during the interactive process 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 19 Yes The rapid spread of COVID19 has disrupted normal work routines and may have resulted in unexpected or increased requests for reasonable accommodation Although employers and employees should address these requests as soon as possible the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID19 pandemic may result in delay in discussing requests and in providing accommodation where warranted Employers and employees are encouraged to use interim solutions to enable employees to keep working as much as possible D18 Federal agencies are required to have timelines in their written reasonable accommodation procedures governing how quickly they will process requests and provide reasonable accommodations What happens if circumstances created by the pandemic prevent an agency from meeting this timeline 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 19 Situations created by the current COVID19 crisis may constitute an “extenuating circumstance”—something beyond a Federal agency’s control—that may justify exceeding the normal timeline that an agency has adopted in its internal reasonable accommodation procedures E PandemicRelated Harassment Due to National Origin Race or Other Protected Characteristics E1 What practical tools are available to employers to reduce and address workplace harassment that may arise as a result of the COVID19 pandemic 4920 Employers can help reduce the chance of harassment by explicitly communicating to the workforce that fear of the COVID19 pandemic should not be misdirected against individuals because of a protected characteristic including their national origin race or other prohibited bases Practical antiharassment tools provided by the EEOC for small businesses can be found here Antiharassment policy tips for small businesses Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace includes detailed recommendations and tools to aid in designing effective antiharassment policies developing training curricula implementing complaint reporting and investigation procedures creating an organizational culture in which harassment is not tolerated report checklists for employers who want to reduce and address harassment in the workplace and chart of risk factors that lead to harassment and appropriate responses E2 Are there steps an employer should take to address possible harassment and discrimination against coworkers when it reopens the workplace 41720 Yes An employer may remind all employees that it is against the federal EEO laws to harass or otherwise discriminate against coworkers based on race national origin color sex religion age 40 or over disability or genetic information It may be particularly helpful for employers to advise supervisors and managers of their roles in watching for stopping and reporting any harassment or other discrimination An employer may also make clear that it will immediately review any allegations of harassment or discrimination and take appropriate action E3 How may employers respond to pandemicrelated harassment in particular against employees who are or are perceived to be Asian 61120 Managers should be alert to demeaning derogatory or hostile remarks directed to employees who are or are perceived to be of Chinese or other Asian national origin including about the coronavirus or its origins All employers covered by Title VII should ensure that management understands in advance how to recognize such harassment Harassment may occur using electronic communication tools—regardless of whether employees are in the workplace teleworking or on leave—and also in person between employees at the worksite Harassment of employees at the worksite may also originate with contractors customers or clients or for example with patients or their family members at health care facilities assisted living facilities and nursing homes Managers should know their legal obligations and be instructed to quickly identify and resolve potential problems before they rise to the level of unlawful discrimination Employers may choose to send a reminder to the entire workforce noting Title VII’s prohibitions on harassment reminding employees that harassment will not be tolerated and inviting anyone who experiences or witnesses workplace harassment to report it to management Employers may remind employees that harassment can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination E4 An employer learns that an employee who is teleworking due to the pandemic is sending harassing emails to another worker What actions should the employer take 61120 The employer should take the same actions it would take if the employee was in the workplace Employees may not harass other employees through for example emails calls or platforms for video or chat communication and collaboration F Furloughs and Layoffs F1 Under the EEOCs laws what waiver responsibilities apply when an employer is conducting layoffs 4920 Special rules apply when an employer is offering employees severance packages in exchange for a general release of all discrimination claims against the employer More information is available in EEOCs technical assistance document on severance agreements F2 What are additional EEO considerations in planning furloughs or layoffs 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 13 The laws enforced by the EEOC prohibit covered employers from selecting people for furlough or layoff because of that individual’s race color religion national origin sex age disability protected genetic information or in retaliation for protected EEO activity G Return to Work G1 As government stayathome orders and other restrictions are modified or lifted in your area how will employers know what steps they can take consistent with the ADA to screen employees for COVID19 when entering the workplace 41720 The ADA permits employers to make disabilityrelated inquiries and conduct medical exams if jobrelated and consistent with business necessity Inquiries and reliable medical exams meet this standard if it is necessary to exclude employees with a medical condition that would pose a direct threat to health or safety Direct threat is to be determined based on the best available objective medical evidence The guidance from CDC or other public health authorities is such evidence Therefore employers will be acting consistent with the ADA as long as any screening implemented is consistent with advice from the CDC and public health authorities for that type of workplace at that time For example this may include continuing to take temperatures and asking questions about symptoms or require selfreporting of all those entering the workplace Similarly the CDC recently posted information on return by certain types of critical workers Employers should make sure not to engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in decisions related to screening and exclusion G2 An employer requires returning workers to wear personal protective gear and engage in infection control practices Some employees ask for accommodations due to a need for modified protective gear Must an employer grant these requests 41720 An employer may require employees to wear protective gear for example masks and gloves and observe infection control practices for example regular hand washing and social distancing protocols However where an employee with a disability needs a related reasonable accommodation under the ADA eg nonlatex gloves modified face masks for interpreters or others who communicate with an employee who uses lip reading or gowns designed for individuals who use wheelchairs or a religious accommodation under Title VII such as modified equipment due to religious garb the employer should discuss the request and provide the modification or an alternative if feasible and not an undue hardship on the operation of the employers business under the ADA or Title VII G3 What does an employee need to do in order to request reasonable accommodation from her employer because she has one of the medical conditions that CDC says may put her at higher risk for severe illness from COVID19 5520 An employee—or a third party such as an employee’s doctor—must let the employer know that she needs a change for a reason related to a medical condition here the underlying condition Individuals may request accommodation in conversation or in writing While the employee or third party does not need to use the term “reasonable accommodation” or reference the ADA she may do so The employee or her representative should communicate that she has a medical condition that necessitates a change to meet a medical need After receiving a request the employer may ask questions or seek medical documentation to help decide if the individual has a disability and if there is a reasonable accommodation barring undue hardship that can be provided G4 The CDC identifies a number of medical conditions that might place individuals at “higher risk for severe illness” if they get COVID19 An employer knows that an employee has one of these conditions and is concerned that his health will be jeopardized upon returning to the workplace but the employee has not requested accommodation How does the ADA apply to this situation 5720 First if the employee does not request a reasonable accommodation the ADA does not mandate that the employer take action If the employer is concerned about the employee’s health being jeopardized upon returning to the workplace the ADA does not allow the employer to exclude the employee—or take any other adverse action— solely because the employee has a disability that the CDC identifies as potentially placing him at “higher risk for severe illness” if he gets COVID19 Under the ADA such action is not allowed unless the employee’s disability poses a “direct threat” to his health that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation The ADA direct threat requirement is a high standard As an affirmative defense direct threat requires an employer to show that the individual has a disability that poses a “significant risk of substantial harm” to his own health under 29 CFR section 16302r regulation addressing direct threat to health or safety of self or others A direct threat assessment cannot be based solely on the condition being on the CDC’s list the determination must be an individualized assessment based on a reasonable medical judgment about this employee’s disability—not the disability in general—using the most current medical knowledge andor on the best available objective evidence The ADA regulation requires an employer to consider the duration of the risk the nature and severity of the potential harm the likelihood that the potential harm will occur and the imminence of the potential harm Analysis of these factors will likely include considerations based on the severity of the pandemic in a particular area and the employee’s own health for example is the employee’s disability wellcontrolled and his particular job duties A determination of direct threat also would include the likelihood that an individual will be exposed to the virus at the worksite Measures that an employer may be taking in general to protect all workers such as mandatory social distancing also would be relevant Even if an employer determines that an employee’s disability poses a direct threat to his own health the employer still cannot exclude the employee from the workplace—or take any other adverse action—unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation absent undue hardship The ADA regulations require an employer to consider whether there are reasonable accommodations that would eliminate or reduce the risk so that it would be safe for the employee to return to the workplace while still permitting performance of essential functions This can involve an interactive process with the employee If there are not accommodations that permit this then an employer must consider accommodations such as telework leave or reassignment perhaps to a different job in a place where it may be safer for the employee to work or that permits telework An employer may only bar an employee from the workplace if after going through all these steps the facts support the conclusion that the employee poses a significant risk of substantial harm to himself that cannot be reduced or eliminated by reasonable accommodation G5 What are examples of accommodation that absent undue hardship may eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level a direct threat to self 5520 Accommodations may include additional or enhanced protective gowns masks gloves or other gear beyond what the employer may generally provide to employees returning to its workplace Accommodations also may include additional or enhanced protective measures for example erecting a barrier that provides separation between an employee with a disability and coworkersthe public or increasing the space between an employee with a disability and others Another possible reasonable accommodation may be elimination or substitution of particular “marginal” functions less critical or incidental job duties as distinguished from the “essential” functions of a particular position In addition accommodations may include temporary modification of work schedules if that decreases contact with coworkers andor the public when on duty or commuting or moving the location of where one performs work for example moving a person to the end of a production line rather than in the middle of it if that provides more social distancing These are only a few ideas Identifying an effective accommodation depends among other things on an employee’s job duties and the design of the workspace An employer and employee should discuss possible ideas the Job Accommodation Network wwwaskjanorg also may be able to assist in helping identify possible accommodations As with all discussions of reasonable accommodation during this pandemic employers and employees are encouraged to be creative and flexible G6 As a best practice and in advance of having some or all employees return to the workplace are there ways for an employer to invite employees to request flexibility in work arrangements 61120 Yes The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act permit employers to make information available in advance to all employees about who to contact—if they wish—to request accommodation for a disability that they may need upon return to the workplace even if no date has been announced for their return If requests are received in advance the employer may begin the interactive process An employer may choose to include in such a notice all the CDClisted medical conditions that may place people at higher risk of serious illness if they contract COVID19 provide instructions about who to contact and explain that the employer is willing to consider on a casebycase basis any requests from employees who have these or other medical conditions An employer also may send a general notice to all employees who are designated for returning to the workplace noting that the employer is willing to consider requests for accommodation or flexibilities on an individualized basis The employer should specify if the contacts differ depending on the reason for the request – for example if the office or person to contact is different for employees with disabilities or pregnant workers than for employees whose request is based on age or childcare responsibilities Either approach is consistent with the ADEA the ADA and the May 29 2020 CDC guidance that emphasizes the importance of employers providing accommodations or flexibilities to employees who due to age or certain medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness Regardless of the approach however employers should ensure that whoever receives inquiries knows how to handle them consistent with the different federal employment nondiscrimination laws that may apply for instance with respect to accommodations due to a medical condition a religious belief or pregnancy G7 What should an employer do if an employee entering the worksite requests an alternative method of screening due to a medical condition 61120 This is a request for reasonable accommodation and an employer should proceed as it would for any other request for accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act If the requested change is easy to provide and inexpensive the employer might voluntarily choose to make it available to anyone who asks without going through an interactive process Alternatively if the disability is not obvious or already known an employer may ask the employee for information to establish that the condition is a disability and what specific limitations require an accommodation If necessary an employer also may request medical documentation to support the employee’s request and then determine if that accommodation or an alternative effective accommodation can be provided absent undue hardship Similarly if an employee requested an alternative method of screening as a religious accommodation the employer should determine if accommodation is available under Title VII H Age H1 The CDC has explained that individuals age 65 and over are at higher risk for a severe case of COVID19 if they contract the virus and therefore has encouraged employers to offer maximum flexibilities to this group Do employees age 65 and over have protections under the federal employment discrimination laws 61120 The Age Discrimination in Employment Act ADEA prohibits employment discrimination against individuals age 40 and older The ADEA would prohibit a covered employer from involuntarily excluding an individual from the workplace based on his or her being 65 or older even if the employer acted for benevolent reasons such as protecting the employee due to higher risk of severe illness from COVID19 Unlike the ADA the ADEA does not include a right to reasonable accommodation for older workers due to age However employers are free to provide flexibility to workers age 65 and older the ADEA does not prohibit this even if it results in younger workers ages 4064 being treated less favorably based on age in comparison Workers age 65 and older also may have medical conditions that bring them under the protection of the ADA as individuals with disabilities As such they may request reasonable accommodation for their disability as opposed to their age H2 If an employer is choosing to offer flexibilities to other workers may older comparable workers be treated less favorably based on age 9820 adapted from 32720 Webinar Question 12 No If an employer is allowing other comparable workers to telework it should make sure it is not treating older workers less favorably based on their age I CaregiversFamily Responsibilities I1 If an employer provides telework modified schedules or other benefits to employees with schoolage children due to school closures or distance learning during the pandemic are there sex discrimination considerations 61120 Employers may provide any flexibilities as long as they are not treating employees differently based on sex or other EEOprotected characteristics For example under Title VII female employees cannot be given more favorable treatment than male employees because of a genderbased assumption about who may have caretaking responsibilities for children J Pregnancy J1 Due to the pandemic may an employer exclude an employee from the workplace involuntarily due to pregnancy 61120 No Sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act includes discrimination based on pregnancy Even if motivated by benevolent concern an employer is not permitted to single out workers on the basis of pregnancy for adverse employment actions including involuntary leave layoff or furlough J2 Is there a right to accommodation based on pregnancy during the pandemic 61120 There are two federal employment discrimination laws that may trigger accommodation for employees based on pregnancy First pregnancyrelated medical conditions may themselves be disabilities under the ADA even though pregnancy itself is not an ADA disability If an employee makes a request for reasonable accommodation due to a pregnancyrelated medical condition the employer must consider it under the usual ADA rules Second Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifically requires that women affected by pregnancy childbirth and related medical conditions be treated the same as others who are similar in their ability or inability to work This means that a pregnant employee may be entitled to job modifications including telework changes to work schedules or assignments and leave to the extent provided for other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work Employers should ensure that supervisors managers and human resources personnel know how to handle such requests to avoid disparate treatment in violation of Title VII K Vaccinations The availability of COVID19 vaccinations may raise questions about the applicablilty of various equal employment opportunity EEO laws including the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act GINA and Title VII including the Pregnancy Discrimination Act see Section J EEO rights relating to pregnancy The EEO laws do not interfere with or prevent employers from following CDC or other federal state and local public health authorities’ guidelines and suggestions ADA and Vaccinations K1 For any COVID19 vaccine that has been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration FDA is the administration of a COVID19 vaccine to an employee by an employer or by a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine a “medical examination” for purposes of the ADA 121620 No The vaccination itself is not a medical examination As the Commission explained in guidance on disabilityrelated inquiries and medical examinations a medical examination is “a procedure or test usually given by a health care professional or in a medical setting that seeks information about an individual’s physical or mental impairments or health” Examples include “vision tests blood urine and breath analyses blood pressure screening and cholesterol testing and diagnostic procedures such as xrays CAT scans and MRIs” If a vaccine is administered to an employee by an employer for protection against contracting COVID19 the employer is not seeking information about an individual’s impairments or current health status and therefore it is not a medical examination Although the administration of a vaccination is not a medical examination prescreening vaccination questions may implicate the ADA’s provision on disabilityrelated inquiries which are inquiries likely to elicit information about a disability If the employer administers the vaccine it must show that such prescreening questions it asks employees are “jobrelated and consistent with business necessity” See Question K2 K2 According to the CDC health care providers should ask certain questions before administering a vaccine to ensure that there is no medical reason that would prevent the person from receiving the vaccination If the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination from the employer or a third party with whom the employer contracts to administer a vaccine and asks these screening questions are these questions subject to the ADA standards for disabilityrelated inquiries 121620 Yes Prevaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about a disability This means that such questions if asked by the employer or a contractor on the employer’s behalf are “disabilityrelated” under the ADA Thus if the employer requires an employee to receive the vaccination administered by the employer the employer must show that these disabilityrelated screening inquiries are “jobrelated and consistent with business necessity” To meet this standard an employer would need to have a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that an employee who does not answer the questions and therefore does not receive a vaccination will pose a direct threat to the health or safety of her or himself or others See Question K5 below for a discussion of direct threat By contrast there are two circumstances in which disabilityrelated screening questions can be asked without needing to satisfy the “jobrelated and consistent with business necessity” requirement First if an employer has offered a vaccination to employees on a voluntary basis ie employees choose whether to be vaccinated the ADA requires that the employee’s decision to answer prescreening disabilityrelated questions also must be voluntary 42 USC 12112d4B 29 CFR 163014d If an employee chooses not to answer these questions the employer may decline to administer the vaccine but may not retaliate against intimidate or threaten the employee for refusing to answer any questions Second if an employee receives an employerrequired vaccination from a third party that does not have a contract with the employer such as a pharmacy or other health care provider the ADA “jobrelated and consistent with business necessity” restrictions on disabilityrelated inquiries would not apply to the prevaccination medical screening questions The ADA requires employers to keep any employee medical information obtained in the course of the vaccination program confidential K3 Is asking or requiring an employee to show proof of receipt of a COVID19 vaccination a disabilityrelated inquiry 121620 No There are many reasons that may explain why an employee has not been vaccinated which may or may not be disabilityrelated Simply requesting proof of receipt of a COVID19 vaccination is not likely to elicit information about a disability and therefore is not a disabilityrelated inquiry However subsequent employer questions such as asking why an individual did not receive a vaccination may elicit information about a disability and would be subject to the pertinent ADA standard that they be “jobrelated and consistent with business necessity” If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID19 vaccination from a pharmacy or their own health care provider the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide any medical information as part of the proof in order to avoid implicating the ADA ADA and Title VII Issues Regarding Mandatory Vaccinations K4 Where can employers learn more about Emergency Use Authorizations EUA of COVID19 vaccines 121620 Some COVID19 vaccines may only be available to the public for the foreseeable future under EUA granted by the FDA which is different than approval under FDA vaccine licensure The FDA has an obligation to Ensure that recipients of the vaccine under an EUA are informed to the extent practicable under the applicable circumstances that FDA has authorized the emergency use of the vaccine of the known and potential benefits and risks the extent to which such benefits and risks are unknown that they have the option to accept or refuse the vaccine and of any available alternatives to the product The FDA says that this information is typically conveyed in a patient fact sheet that is provided at the time of the vaccine administration and that it posts the fact sheets on its website More information about EUA vaccines is available on the FDA’s EUA page K5 If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID19 vaccination because of a disability 121620 The ADA allows an employer to have a qualification standard that includes “a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of individuals in the workplace” However if a safetybased qualification standard such as a vaccination requirement screens out or tends to screen out an individual with a disability the employer must show that an unvaccinated employee would pose a direct threat due to a “significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation” 29 CFR 16302r Employers should conduct an individualized assessment of four factors in determining whether a direct threat exists the duration of the risk the nature and severity of the potential harm the likelihood that the potential harm will occur and the imminence of the potential harm A conclusion that there is a direct threat would include a determination that an unvaccinated individual will expose others to the virus at the worksite If an employer determines that an individual who cannot be vaccinated due to disability poses a direct threat at the worksite the employer cannot exclude the employee from the workplace—or take any other action—unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation absent undue hardship that would eliminate or reduce this risk so the unvaccinated employee does not pose a direct threat If there is a direct threat that cannot be reduced to an acceptable level the employer can exclude the employee from physically entering the workplace but this does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal state and local authorities For example if an employer excludes an employee based on an inability to accommodate a request to be exempt from a vaccination requirement the employee may be entitled to accommodations such as performing the current position remotely This is the same step that employers take when physically excluding employees from a worksite due to a current COVID19 diagnosis or symptoms some workers may be entitled to telework or if not may be eligible to take leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act under the FMLA or under the employer’s policies See also Section J EEO rights relating to pregnancy Managers and supervisors responsible for communicating with employees about compliance with the employer’s vaccination requirement should know how to recognize an accommodation request from an employee with a disability and know to whom the request should be referred for consideration Employers and employees should engage in a flexible interactive process to identify workplace accommodation options that do not constitute an undue hardship significant difficulty or expense This process should include determining whether it is necessary to obtain supporting documentation about the employee’s disability and considering the possible options for accommodation given the nature of the workforce and the employee’s position The prevalence in the workplace of employees who already have received a COVID19 vaccination and the amount of contact with others whose vaccination status could be unknown may impact the undue hardship consideration In discussing accommodation requests employers and employees also may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network JAN website as a resource for different types of accommodations wwwaskjanorg JAN’s materials specific to COVID19 are at httpsaskjanorgtopicsCOVID19cfm Employers may rely on CDC recommendations when deciding whether an effective accommodation that would not pose an undue hardship is available but as explained further in Question K7 there may be situations where an accommodation is not possible When an employer makes this decision the facts about particular job duties and workplaces may be relevant Employers also should consult applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards and guidance Employers can find OSHA COVIDspecific resources at wwwoshagovSLTCcovid19 Managers and supervisors are reminded that it is unlawful to disclose that an employee is receiving a reasonable accommodation or retaliate against an employee for requesting an accommodation K6 If an employer requires vaccinations when they are available how should it respond to an employee who indicates that he or she is unable to receive a COVID19 vaccination because of a sincerely held religious practice or belief 121620 Once an employer is on notice that an employee’s sincerely held religious belief practice or observance prevents the employee from receiving the vaccination the employer must provide a reasonable accommodation for the religious belief practice or observance unless it would pose an undue hardship under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act Courts have defined “undue hardship” under Title VII as having more than a de minimis cost or burden on the employer EEOC guidance explains that because the definition of religion is broad and protects beliefs practices and observances with which the employer may be unfamiliar the employer should ordinarily assume that an employee’s request for religious accommodation is based on a sincerely held religious belief If however an employee requests a religious accommodation and an employer has an objective basis for questioning either the religious nature or the sincerity of a particular belief practice or observance the employer would be justified in requesting additional supporting information K7 What happens if an employer cannot exempt or provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee who cannot comply with a mandatory vaccine policy because of a disability or sincerely held religious practice or belief 121620 If an employee cannot get vaccinated for COVID19 because of a disability or sincerely held religious belief practice or observance and there is no reasonable accommodation possible then it would be lawful for the employer to exclude the employee from the workplace This does not mean the employer may automatically terminate the worker Employers will need to determine if any other rights apply under the EEO laws or other federal state and local authorities Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act GINA and Vaccinations K8 Is Title II of GINA implicated when an employer administers a COVID19 vaccine to employees or requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID19 vaccination 121620 No Administering a COVID19 vaccination to employees or requiring employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID19 vaccination does not implicate Title II of GINA because it does not involve the use of genetic information to make employment decisions or the acquisition or disclosure of “genetic information” as defined by the statute This includes vaccinations that use messenger RNA mRNA technology which will be discussed more below As noted in Question K9 however if administration of the vaccine requires prescreening questions that ask about genetic information the inquiries seeking genetic information such as family members’ medical histories may violate GINA Under Title II of GINA employers may not 1 use genetic information to make decisions related to the terms conditions and privileges of employment 2 acquire genetic information except in six narrow circumstances or 3 disclose genetic information except in six narrow circumstances Certain COVID19 vaccines use mRNA technology This raises questions about genetics and specifically about whether such vaccines modify a recipient’s genetic makeup and therefore whether requiring an employee to get the vaccine as a condition of employment is an unlawful use of genetic information The CDC has explained that the mRNA COVID19 vaccines “do not interact with our DNA in any way” and “mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell which is where our DNA genetic material is kept” See httpswwwcdcgovcoronavirus2019ncovvaccinesdifferentvaccinesmrnahtml for a detailed discussion about how mRNA vaccines work Thus requiring employees to get the vaccine whether it uses mRNA technology or not does not violate GINA’s prohibitions on using acquiring or disclosing genetic information K9 Does asking an employee the prevaccination screening questions before administering a COVID19 vaccine implicate Title II of GINA 121620 Prevaccination medical screening questions are likely to elicit information about disability as discussed in Question K2 and may elicit information about genetic information such as questions regarding the immune systems of family members It is not yet clear what screening checklists for contraindications will be provided with COVID19 vaccinations GINA defines “genetic information” to mean Information about an individual’s genetic tests Information about the genetic tests of a family member Information about the manifestation of disease or disorder in a family member ie family medical history Information about requests for or receipt of genetic services or the participation in clinical research that includes genetic services by the an individual or a family member of the individual and Genetic information about a fetus carried by an individual or family member or of an embryo legally held by an individual or family member using assisted reproductive technology 29 CFR § 16353c If the prevaccination questions do not include any questions about genetic information including family medical history then asking them does not implicate GINA However if the prevaccination questions do include questions about genetic information then employers who want to ensure that employees have been vaccinated may want to request proof of vaccination instead of administering the vaccine themselves GINA does not prohibit an individual employee’s own health care provider from asking questions about genetic information but it does prohibit an employer or a doctor working for the employer from asking questions about genetic information If an employer requires employees to provide proof that they have received a COVID19 vaccination from their own health care provider the employer may want to warn the employee not to provide genetic information as part of the proof As long as this warning is provided any genetic information the employer receives in response to its request for proof of vaccination will be considered inadvertent and therefore not unlawful under GINA See 29 CFR 16358b1i for model language that can be used for this warning Return to top US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC

322,html CimaVaxEGF Wikipedia Open main menu Home Random Nearby Log in Settings Donate About Wikipedia Disclaimers Search CimaVaxEGF Language Watch Edit CimaVaxEGF is a vaccine used to treat cancer specifically nonsmallcell lung carcinoma NSCLC CIMAvaxEGF is composed of recombinant human epidermal growth factor EGF conjugated to a protein carrier 1 The vaccine was developed by the Center of Molecular Immunology Havana Cuba 2 3 There are agreements in place to test it in the United States Japan and some European countries 4 It is currently available in Cuba Colombia Bosnia and Herzegovina Peru and Paraguay 5 In October 2015 Serbia s Institute of Virology Vaccines and Sera AKA Torlak Institute signed a memorandum for use in 30 patients as part of a study 6 CimaVax is relatively cheap to produce and store and has low toxicity 4 Side effects of the vaccine appear to be mild and include chills fever and feeling sick 7 8 Contents 1 Mechanism 2 Research 21 Cuba 22 International 3 References Mechanism Edit CimaVax is an active vaccine with which patients are immunized with epidermal growth factor EGF thus raising antibodies targeting EGF itself The product is also formulated with the Neisseria meningitidis outer protein P64k and Montanide ISA 51 as adjuvants to potentiate the immune response 9 8 The epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR is hijacked by many types of cancer including cancers of the lung colon kidney and head and neck By raising antibodies against EGF which is EGFRs major ligand the concentrations of EGF in the blood are reduced Thus CimaVax does not target the cancer cells directly but is expected to work against these cancers by denying the cancers the growth stimulus they require 8 10 For this reason the Roswell Park Cancer Institute group thinks that it may prove most useful as a preventive vaccine rather than as a cancer therapy per se 4 Research Edit Cuba Edit needs update Early trials showed a trend towards improved survival among vaccinated test subjects 8 11 A direct correlation between the level of antibodies that a vaccinated patient raises against EGF and survival has been observed in several trials 8 and in one of the largest trials 10 there was also an agedependence with only subjects under the age of 60 benefiting in terms of survival 8 More antibodies are raised when the vaccine is formulated with Montanide ISA 51 rather than aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant and when patients receive a low dose of cyclophosphamide three days before vaccine administration 8 Cyclophosphamide is thought to temporarily block the bodys natural immune tolerance to EGF thereby increasing antibody titers 8 Researchers caution that the early results to date have been in relatively small earlystage trials with patients that were carefully selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria and given specialized oncology care they may therefore not be representative of most patients who might benefit from the vaccine 8 It has been urged that CimaVax be tested in patients with earlierstage NSCLC cancer and in patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy and that research be conducted to determine which subgroups of NSCLC patients do and dont respond to the vaccine 8 It has been suggested that CimaVax may also be effective in other types of cancer that are dependent on EGFEGFR including many cases of prostate cancer 8 International Edit Trials are being organized in the United States the European Union Japan 4 and Serbia 6 In late October 2016 the United States Food and Drug Administration authorized 12 the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to conduct a PhaseIII clinical trial of CimaVAX in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer 13 By the middle of the following month nearly 200 people had volunteered to be subjects in the trial 14 In September 2018 Principal Investigator Grace Dy shared the initial results of the first Roswell Park trial 15 They found that the combination of CIMAvax with the PD1 inhibitor checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab was safe and well tolerated in 13 people with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC when administered at the doses normally recommended for each agent individually 15 Notably they observed durable responses to the combination treatment in patients who were unlikely to benefit from nivolumab alone due to low tumor levels of PDL1 suggesting that the combination may work better than either agent individually 15 The final results of this early trial were released in March 2019 16 The results were in line with the September 2018 report with the additional finding that patients receiving combination therapy in this trial were more likely to develop robust early antibody responses to CIMAvax as compared with what had been observed in earlier studies with CIMAvax alone 16 An ongoing Phase II clinical trial clinicaltrialsgov identifier NCT02955290 has been expanded to include patients with advanced recurrent head and neck squamouscell carcinoma as well as patients with advanced NSCLC but with high PDL1 levels who will be treated with pembrolizumab in combination with CIMAvax instead of nivolumab 16 References Edit

large normalcy ONLY returns when we largely vaccinated the entire global population says the vaccine dealer Bill Gates For decades corporate medias propaganda machinery has been pedestalizing Bill Gates as a billionaire philanthropist genius who invented Microsoft and wishes to help humanity But Bill Gates is neither a genius nor interested in the wellbeing of the working class and the poor He was born into the 1 from a father who rubbed shoulders with central banking elites like the Rockefellers Bills grandfather was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Seattle Bills mother came from a long line of money and power as the daughter of a wealthy banker and the granddaughter of the president of the national city bank of Seattle and the director of the Seattle branch of the Federal Reserve Bill Gates simply used his parents money to pay the company that stole the DOS from its original inventor Gary Kildall Bill also tried to conspire against his own partner Paul Allen by cunningly reducing his shares at Microsoft After funding the creation of COVID19 Bill Gates is now appearing constantly on the Rothschildowned corporate media to reaffirm his position that the martial law will never end unless everyone on Earth is forcefully vaccinated for the virus that he helped create Yes the same guy who created the worlds first computer virus and whos currently in the business of viruses and vaccines is promising the whole world a mandatory vaccine Three years ago at the Munich Security Conference in Germany Bill Gates warned the world of a deadly coronavirus pandemic that could kill over 30 million people In the same year of that speech Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates vowed that they would not give up on their goal to implement population control Family Planning in doublespeak on 120 million women worldwide by 2020 Not only Bill Gates has been warning for years about a deadly coronavirus outbreak that would kill millions of people but he also ran a coronavirus simulation a couple of months before the real outbreak in Wuhan Scientists funded by the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation simulated a global coronavirus pandemic that was dubbed Event 201 and it showed that a coronavirus outbreak could potentially kill hundreds of millions of people under the right circumstances Bill Gates is now funding a 10yearold company called Moderna to develop and patent a vaccine for COVID19 Modernas stocks have been soaring since the beginning of the pandemic Bill Gates is a known eugenicist who actively pursues population control through vaccinations and drugs around the globe His obsession with population control sterilization and abortion is inspired by his father who was the head of Planned Parenthood He regularly gives televised speeches and openly talks about culling the global human population by 10 or 15 through vaccines Hundreds of thousands of children in Africa and Asia died or were crippled by vaccine experiments conducted on them through corporations funded by the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation Most often these vaccines have been used as a trojan horse by Bill Gates to satisfy his obsession with population control For example under the guise of eradicating neonatal tetanus a campaign funded by the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation carried out a wellcoordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise in Kenya in 2014 using an antigen that causes miscarriages in a vaccine that was administered to 23 million girls and women by the World Health Organization and UNICEF Both the WHO and UNICEF are mercenary

2019 and October 2020 Of these four are Chinese — Xiaomi Vivo realme and Oppo In October 2019 these Chinese brands sold an estimated 4607 lakh smartphones Fast forward a year and the sales jumped by nearly 17 lakh to 6301 lakh smartphones These numbers were calculated based on the figures shared by the smartphone market analyst Graphic by Ramandeep Kaur ThePrint The estimates show that consumer trends didn’t take a hit from the boycott calls that emerged in June after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash with Chinese soldiers Among those supporting the boycott was Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan In June the government banned the first tranche of Chinese apps adding to the list over the months As it stands October saw two prominent and heavily promoted online sales from Amazon and Flipkart to coincide with the festive shopping season While Amazon held its ‘Great Indian Festival sale’ from 16 October to 13 November offering discounts up to 70 per cent Flipkart held its flagship ‘Big Billion Days sale’ from 16 to 21 October This year’s ‘Great Indian Festival’ was one of the longest Amazon has held according to a Times of India report Flipkart said it saw double the number of customers visiting its mobile category during the sale Also read India working to restrict Chinese goods investments since before Galwan Covid Officials Estimates in line with market trend Adwait Mardikar an analyst at a tech market intelligence firm Canalys told ThePrint that the figures for October 2019 and October 2020 appear to be fairly logical based on the sales data for the third quarters of 2019 and 2020 “Third quarter is the months of June July and September It is reasonable to assume that not too much has changed in terms of purchasing decisions from JuneSeptember moving to October” he added Analyst firms typically publicly share smartphone shipment figures for every quarter but not the sales figures for every month In some cases the monthly smartphone sales figures are a paid feature analyst firms offer to paying clients Shipments and sales figures differ since ‘shipments’ are the number of devices sent to retail channels to be sold to end consumers Not all shipped merchandise gets sold according to a Business Insider report Also read Reader View India depends on China in many ways to disregard that isn’t a smart decision How the top 5 brands compare Analyst firms IDC Canalys and Counterpoint Research all list Xiaomi Samsung realme Vivo and Oppo as the top 5 brands in India that together corner 8894 per cent of the country’s smartphone market share Of this the four Chinese brands — Xiaomi realme Vivo and Oppo — account for 6973 per cent of the market share according to the latest numbers from the three analyst firms However the estimated market share of each brand differs marginally from one firm’s analysis to the next For instance Canalys says Xiaomi held top market share in the third quarter of 2020 with 261 per cent followed by Samsung at 204 Counterpoint Research though shows Samsung as the top brand in Q3 this year with 24 per cent of the market share followed by Xiaomi with 23 per cent Also read Only

how teaching of fake history and a free run to proselytizers have destroyed the pride for INDIA and made a huge propaganda machine of left wing radicals supported by church and jihadist very effecient for anti HINDU rhetoric It will take time to ensure TRUTH filters through the majority Reply Dr Binoy Shanker Prasad 30 December 2020 At 1156 am Historically people have never been 100 nationalist at boycotting totally trades in goods and services belonging to hostile countries Phenomena like stealing backstabbing nonpatriotic behavior counterespionage profiteering smuggling or pricegouging take place all the time particularly in difficult times when a nation is in crisis In war zones sometimes arms supplied to one side end up in the hands of the other side It’s true as the previous commentator said that it’s not the “Indians” alone who should be accused of buying the Chinese devices but the middlemen business brokers the banias who facilitated these sales in India for profit However in a country of 13 billion if 17 lakh consumers went in for ‘cheap buying’ it shouldn’t be that alarming Nationalism patriotism or even ‘citizenawakening’ can’t be expected from all Indians Just notice in educated and welltodo neighborhoods of New DelhiNOIDA area for example people buy in huge quantity fire crackers made in China against government pollution advisory Indians must be trained in healthy nationalism and citizenshipawareness from their childhood Reply Sriram R 30 December 2020 At 947 am All these talk about buying Chinese phones and patriotism of the Indians is useless talk It indicates nothing As the reason is the intellectual laziness and short term memory of the consumers If Made in China was prominently displayed next to the image of the product in the top of the page I am sure the sales of Chinese phones would have been lower Also most of the Chinese companies mentioned have their manufacturing base in India as well and many of the less than 10k models are most probably produced in India Whereas most of the Indian companies have their manufacturing base in China When I was hunting for few items like electric kettle and was particular about not buying a Chinese product To my horror – Bajaj Maharajah VGuard and for countless other Indian companies the country of origin was China So how does it make any difference whether we buy Chinese company phone or Indian company product Reply Shroid 30 December 2020 At 218 am Is the bar graph correct How can the sales be so less when the smartphone units sold are itself in millions Reply Aldra

thing is that Samsung has improved by 50 compared with last year From losing market share to gaining There are mostly Chinese brands under INR 10 000 so consumer cannot be blamed but where there is choice…Chinese have lost market share Reply Irene 29 December 2020 At 1241 pm Government is fooling people And the buyers of Chinese products are senseless I think instead of boycotting Chinese products They are more coming in Reply Neil 29 December 2020 At 1100 am This is a failure of big proportion with our chalta hain attitude on full display Money talks and people have chosen luxury over

more Chinese phones this October despite Galwan” doesn’t revel the complete truth The better truth is “Indian traders” forced 17lakh Chinese mobile phones on fellow Indians Why cannot Indian traders deal with the Chinese Why cannot BCCI say no to advertisements from Chinese phonemakers These are the same traders who blindly support BJPRSS and trumpet nationalistic slogans and accuse all minorities dalits as antinationals for whatever they do These same traders then deal with Chinese companies surreptitiously and then this news comes that “Indians bought 17lakh Chinese phones” Don’t

of Business Economy CEO Secrets Global Car Industry Business of Sport One day everyone will use Chinas digital currency By Danny Vincent BBC News Hong Kong Published 25 September 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Chandler Guo image caption Chandler Guo at one of his cryptocurrency mines Chandler Guo was a pioneer in cryptocurrency the digital currencies that can be created and used independently of national central banks and governments In 2014 he set up an operation to produce one of those currencies Bitcoin in a secret location in western China Mining Bitcoin is a power hungry enterprise involving dozens of computers so he used power from a hydroelectric station in partnership with a local Chinese government official At its peak his machines were capable of mining 30 of the worlds Bitcoin He believed Bitcoin would one day change the world and replace the dollar But now he sees a new force emerging a payment system created by the Chinese state and known as Digital Currency Electronic Payment DCEP Its really a digital version of Chinas official currency the yuan and Mr Guo feels DCEP will become the dominant global currency One day everyone in the world will be using DCEP he says DCEP will be successful because there are a lot of Chinese people living outside of China there are 39 million Chinese living outside of the country If they have a connection with China they will use the DCEP They can make DCEP become an international currency But many question whether it will succeed and there are concerns that it will be used by Beijing to spy on citizens media caption Bitcoin explained How do cryptocurrencies work Like Bitcoin DCEP utilises a blockchain technology a type of digitised ledger used to verify transactions Blockchain acts as a universal record of every transaction ever made on that network and users collaborate to verify new transactions when they occur In practice that means users dont need a bank if for example they want to pay each other perhaps with their phones China plans to launch DCEP later this year But so far the Peoples Bank of China has not given an exact date for the nationwide launch China began testing the digital currency earlier this year in selected cities When rolled out it will allow users to link downloaded electronic wallets to their bank cards make transactions and transfer money image copyright Getty Images image caption The new digital yuan will be controlled by the Peoples Bank of China Its hard to predict the timeline but the Peoples Bank of China is under a lot of pressure to accelerate the development because they do not want to be in a world where Libra Facebooks digital currency becomes the global currency which they think is worse than the current global financial system controlled by the US says Linghao Bao an analyst from Beijingbased Trivium Observers say China wants to internationalise the yuan so that it can compete with the dollar The Chinese government believes that if some other countries can also use the Chinese currency it can break the United States monetary sovereignty The United States has built the current global financial system and the instruments says an anonymous Chinese cryptocurrency observer known as Bitfool The technology enthusiast worked in the venture capital sector before joining a number of Chinese internet companies He started researching Bitcoin and believes that digital currencies represent the future of money More Technology of Business Lack of investment behind delayed court cases How photographers track down stolen pictures When changing a light bulb is a really big deal Fans face closer tracking when stadiums reopen Can artificial intelligence create a decent dinner Some traditional banking systems cant serve a poor country In the traditional system if you only have 10 a bank cant make money from you but with digital currency everyone has the right to enter The threshold to enter is really low he says Although Facebook has scaled back its plans for Libra it was still a concern for China The social media giant plans to roll out an ewallet known as Novi later this year It will work as a standalone app but can also be available on Messenger and WhatsApp The two sides are definitely involved in financial warfare even though no large confrontation has happened yet says Linghao Bao Observers like Bitfool believe that China is already further ahead of the US in the battle for the future of money Chinas digital payment systems are widely seen as the most advanced in the world The country is on the verge of becoming a cashless society In 2019 four out of every five payments in China were made through either Tencents WeChat Pay or Alibabas Alipay image copyright Getty Images image caption The new currency could be big if Chinese communities outside China adopt it America is the leader of the global financial system But they dont have the motivation like China to make the change to a digital currency says Bitfool China wants to share that power But for America Libra is just a backup plan In poor countries and also in China there are a lot of people who live in villages They have very little money but they are using smartphones If you can buy a smartphone you can use DCEP However DCEP will be centralised and staterun unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum which are free of state control image copyright Chandler Guo image caption To create a significant amount of cryptocurrency you need a lot of computing power Many Bitcoin enthusiasts fear that DCEP will be used as a tool by the Chinese Communist Party to exert greater control over their citizens through surveillance The authorities will be able to monitor how money is spent in real time They will also have the same controls over DCEP as with the yuan The yuan is tightly controlled by Beijing and its exchange rate is the source of much tension between the US and China The US accuses China of keeping the yuan weak to benefit its economy DCEP is the antithesis of Bitcoin The ultimate goal of a cryptocurrency is the separation of money and state says Stewart Mackenzie a cryptocurrency expert based in Hong Kong Its easy for them to say that its like Bitcoin when its worlds apart Linghao Bao agrees DCEP is built on an idea of centralised control The value of Bitcoin lies in its decentralisation nature and its isolation from the financial system Mr Bao says I trust Bitcoin more Because it really belongs to me says Bitfool Related Topics China Cryptocurrency Hong Kong Bitcoin Top Stories George Floyds

International Media and Culture Political Economy Radio US Politics War and Empire omnibus Search Search The Planet’s Problem from Hell Samantha Power Ann Garrison BAR Contributing Editor 16 Dec 2020 The Planet’s Problem from Hell Samantha Power As head of USAID Power will be in perfect position to wield foreign aid as a cudgel for beating foreign heads of state till they bow to US empire writes Ann Garrison “ Having successfully advocated for USled NATO wars in Libya and Syria Power set her sights on the tiny impoverished East African nation of Burundi” Just when it seemed that Joe Biden’s coming administration couldn’t be more of a horror show Axios reported that he’s likely to appoint another monster from the deep violent knowitall Samantha Power to head the US Agency for International Development USAID I rescheduled my piece on contact tracing’s potential to further empower the surveillance state for next year’s first Black Agenda Report and instead updated my 2015 piece “ Samantha Power Africa’s Problem from Hell ” As I said then when Power was serving the second of her four years as President Obama’s US Ambassador to the UN she was on a mission to save Africans from African savagery but her largesse extends to all those who need American bombs to calm ethnic strife She wants you to call 1800GENOCIDE so she can alert the president to send in the Marines or other US Special Forces As head of USAID she’ll be in perfect position to wield foreign aid as a cudgel for beating foreign heads of state till they line up behind US empire which she understands as a neverending campaign to stop genocide and defend human rights Indeed Power actually seems to believe this unlike those who shamelessly invoke human rights but know full well that US foreign policy is about economic exploitation andor domination of any nonNATO nation that dares to raise an independent head In “ The E ducation of an Idealist A Memoir ” published in 2019 she writes of how she all but immolated in her own burning selfrighteousness while reporting from Bosnia in the 1990s “ I had never been without opinions but my certitude previously had to do with seemingly trivial issues like an umpire’s bad call in a baseball game Now as I researched and reflected on real ‐ world events I seemed unable to contain my emotions or modulate my judgments If the subject of Bosnia came up and someone innocently described the conflict as a civil war I would erupt It is genocide” Antiwar activist and writer David Swanson wrote one of my favorite headlines of 2017 Samantha Power Can See Russia from Her Padded Cell In the Counterpunch piece he shared highlights of Power’s overwrought performance at the Atlantic Council where she railed at Russia for aggression threatening the US and the global rule of law in Ukraine Syria France Germany Montenegro and beyond and demanded that NATO be on hairtrigger alert Padded cell indeed On December 14 CNN Pentagon correspondent reported that a Russian missile drill had just triggered a false alarm at a US military base in Germany and I can only assume that Samantha Power was reassured that they’re locked and loaded with all the latest worldending nuclear weapons If anyone knows of a psychological professional’s analysis of Power’s mind as publicly manifest please send it to me at the eaddress in my bio tag at the bottom of this article David Swanson also cited William Blum’s list of US attempts to overthrow governments asterisks where successful none of which soften Power’s missionary zeal China

Somalia 2007 to present Honduras 2009 Libya 2011 Syria 2012 Ukraine 2014 Africa’s Problem from Hell In my 2015 piece on Samantha Power I focused on her human rights rage in Africa Having successfully advocated for USled NATO wars in Libya and Syria “to stop the next Rwanda” she then had her sights set on the tiny impoverished East African nation of Burundi which had dared to contract with a majority Russian firm to mine its nickel and form strategic alliances with Russia and China Wikileaks’ diplomatic cables reveal that Western interests had had their eyes on Burundi’s nickel for decades before its government under the late President Pierre Nkurunziza signed with the Russian firm which they said had offered better terms Burundi shares the HutuTutsiTwa ethnic divisions with neighboring Rwanda and a highly geostrategic border with the resource rich Democratic Republic of Congo Power along with Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth was stridently warning that Burundian President Nkurunziza and his political party were plotting Tutsi genocide Power shrieked for regime change but Russia and China had Burundi’s back on the UN Security Council UNSC and it survived to celebrate its removal from the UNSC’s “agenda” this month which means that its sovereignty is now relatively secure and there was no new genocide Much of Power’s career is based on her historically inaccurate decontextualized and grossly oversimplified account of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide during which she alleges the US “stood by” From that point on she moralizes US citizens must be “upstanders” not bystanders “Never again” can we fail in our moral duty to stop the world’s backward peoples from massacring one another over ethnic difference She wrote a Pulitzer Prizewinning book “ The Problem From Hell America in the Age of Genocide ” in which she expands on her Atlantic article on Rwanda “ Bystanders to Genocide ” and calls America to arms “Power shrieked for regime change but Russia and China had Burundi’s back on the UN Security Council” Power fails to note that the US stood by intentionally not indifferently in Rwanda until US ally Gen Paul Kagame won a war of aggression begun four years earlier The Rwandan death toll was many hundreds of thousands higher than the Pentagon had projected but otherwise everything went according to plan Two years later the Congo Wars began and the US and UK unseated France as the dominant power in the African Great Lakes Region US troops now appear only as “advisors” south of the Sahara although “ Mass Atrocities Prevention a Military Planning Handbook ” describes the swift surgical deployment of US Special Forces as a blueprint at the ready For now there are plenty of African troops serving under US military command and grateful to receive the salaries that boost their class status in Africa though they’d be considered poverty wages here In 2011 President Obama appointed Power to head his Mass Atrocities Review Board All but a few African nations now have soldiers serving within AFRICOM the US Africa Command and Burundi’s belligerent neighbor Rwanda is one of the greatest troop contributors One complication of the Burundian situation is that Burundian troops serve in AM ISON the Pentagonled African Union Mission to Somalia Fighting and casualties had already taken place on Burundi’s tense border with Rwanda in 2015 and five of Burundi’s ruling party leaders including the Burundian security and intelligence chief were assassinated This made it clear that President Nkurunziza who was hugely popular with the country’s rural Hutu peasant majority could be the next target That greatly alarmed all those who remember that the assassination of three Hutu presidents within two years 19931994 precipitated the Rwandan and Burundian bloodbaths of the 1990s Samantha Power decried the assassinations on both sides in Burundi and threatened sanctions but she laid all the blame for the Burundian crisis on President Nkurunziza Why Because he had claimed the constitutional right to be elected twice by universal suffrage then won by 69 percent However she spoke not a word of protest in 2010 when Rwandan President Paul Kagame claimed the same right and won by a thoroughly implausible 93 percent majority Or in 2011 when President Kabila claimed the same right then claimed a victory that d elegitimized all Congolese institutions according to the Carter Center’s election observer mission The regional and ethnic tensions which were then most fiercely focused on Burundi are real and the mass violence often horrifying but the world’s industrial and military power elites are always in play behind the news and Samantha Power’s latest African anxieties however righteously and rabidly she conceives

Moblaji Temitayo Odunayo Oluwafemo Owolabi Adesanya or to many The Last Stylebender was born on July 22 1989 in Lagos Nigeria Adesanya doesn’t have the traditional humble beginnings story many fighters have Instead he grew up in a comfortable upper middle class family that consisted of two educated parents four younger siblings and house maids Adesanya’s trainer and mentor Eugene Bareman interviewed him for TheCoconetTV earlier this year and jokingly asked “What was it like growing up in Lagos Nigeria with a silver spoon up your ass” However it wasn’t all fun and games for the Nigerian native Adesanya’s parents instilled discipline in their son and they accepted nothing less than his best performance at home and in school His mother Taiwois is a nurse and his father Femi is an accountant meaning Adesanya was on the path to become either a lawyer a doctor or as he says a disappointment As a child Adesanya attended Chrisland School at Opebi and while life was generally easy when his grades would drop stern punishments would follow Outside of focusing on just his education in order to please his parents Adesanya directed his passion towards taekwondo and dancing Yet due to his destruction of the home in an attempt to practice his newly learned martial arts skills Adesanya’s mom removed him from classes just three weeks before he obtained his yellow belt Eventually in an attempt to have better recognized education Adesanya’s parents chose to vacate Nigeria and move to first Ghana and then to New Zealand in October of 2001 Israel was just 12 years old America was a potential option for the Adesanya’s but unfortunately the country was just a month removed from 911 and on the verge of war The goal was to give Adesanya and his siblings a chance at obtaining a degree that would be recognized by the western world Little did Adesanya’s parents know this decision would foster the events that cultivated a mixed martial arts world champion This was the birth of the “Broken Native” a term Adesanya now has plastered across his chest for the world to see The moniker represents Israel’s social distancing tendencies that he would partake in before it was mandatory He always felt different as he calls it like the village idiot or the odd one out This feeling of being an outcast would forever change how Adesanya carried himself and viewed the outside world His family settled into Rotorua a city located on the southern shores of Lake Rotorua located in the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand’s North Island Here Adesanya would attend Rotorua Boys’ High School where three outlining factors would define who he is today Adesanya was bullied heavily in high school He explained to TVNZ “I didn’t realize I was black until I moved here” “I remember a kid from school kept on riding past my house and going ‘go back to your country blackinese’” The local Kiwi children viewed him as an outsider they frowned upon his aspirations asked him if he bled yellow and reveled in making his high school years hell Due to his Nigerian education Adesanya was years ahead of his peers in school causing even more reasons for him to be looked at as a threat The second defining factor of Adesanya’s high school years was the discovery of dance and the influence it could have on those around him He danced for years under the name “Black Magic” instead of focusing on martial arts He crushed a performance at his high school talent show and soon realized the beautiful correlation he could devise between dance and fighting Finally it occurred to Adesanya that the aspirations his parents had for him may not be the same aspirations he had for himself He had this epiphany that his life was destined to go a different route that he was primed for something much more special In his high school years the love for Japanese anime began as well Naruto and Death Note became the flare behind Adesanya’s visions of holding this ninja like persona Then in 2008 the 18 year old saw a movie that would forever alter the course of his life “Ong Bak’s” martial arts action portrayed by Tony Jaa became an inspiration to Adesanya and his introduction into Muay Thai The new movie compiled with a couple years of bullying was enough to make him abandon college and begin training One thing you quickly learn about Adesanya watching him talk is that his memory is impeccable He has this perfect recollection of events from years past and he’s excellent at copying what he sees Two things that translate exceptionally well when it comes to picking up tendencies in martial arts and dance Every lesson Adesanya learned in his youth constructed the tools he uses as weapons today His personality and weirdness goes hand and hand with his creative striking The passion and intense drive he has comes from his strong minded parents and sense of social isolation growing up The confidence he has from dance flows perfectly into his eccentric personality and flashy fighting style He’s always pretended dreamed and then acted on his visions never dwelling on bad outcomes Things we’re a bit shaky at first but Adesanya began his Muay Thai training in Whanganui New Zealand under Derek Broughton until he found City Kick Boxing’s Eugene Bareman In 2009 Adesanya took an amateur MMA fight after having received very little training It was December and Adesanya would meet Bareman just a day before his first fight at the ABA Bareman had no idea who he was but was roped into cornering the aspiring fighter by a friend Adesanya lost his first amatuer fight to Neroni Savaiinaea in which he was on his back for two thirds of the fight As Eugene Bareman puts it “he absolutely got his ass kicked” In 2010 Adesanya decided to inform his parents he would travel to Auckland New Zealand in order to further his martial arts studies He knew of a couple kickboxing gyms in the area and made what to many would seem like a frightening life decision After driving up to Auckland Adesanya reconnected with Eugene Bareman at City KickBoxing CKB After seeing his first bout Bareman was a slight bit apprehensive in letting Adesanya stay at the gym He offered up other potential gyms as places where Israel could go to learn similar skills in a deliberate attempt to banish the newcomer The stubborn teenager didn’t budge and stayed due to the strong spiritual connection he felt at CKB There was something in the environment at the gym he could sense an allure to it other gyms simply wouldn’t have This was the beginning of an apprentice and his journey with his new found master Bareman and Adesanya have great chemistry and they realized it the first time Eugene held pads for Israel It’s like a big brother little brother relationship Adesanya calls Bareman the ying to his yang The way I see it City KickBoxing is like The Ninja Turtles Eugene Barmeman is Splinter He’s very wise cerebral honest hard working and humble Adesanya is Leonardo the courageous leader of the gym devoted to his Sensei Or maybe he’s more like Rafael the team’s bad boy the very loyal student who provides the dry humor and sarcasm the gym needs to keep laughing Either way Bareman’s students like Hooker Kara France Volkanovski and Adesanya are the turtles and he is their Splinter Under the tutelage of Bareman Adesanya would conquer the world of kickboxing Mind you Eugene Bareman fought himself He amassed a record of 43 in MMA and had a very successful kickboxing career in New Zealand before he retired from competition and opened up CKB with Doug Viney in 2007 The gym was Adesanya and Bareman’s bat cave as they would travel the world competing in China Australia Brazil The United States and even Turkey As an amateur kickboxer Adesanya went 320 and as a professional he achieved an astonishing record of 755 with 48 KO’s September 4 2013 was the day Adesanya freed himself from the routine 95 day job “I remember the day walking out of the office and never looking back that was my last job my last 95” he recalls Adesanya would travel to China with Bareman in an attempt to rapidly compete with more prestigious competition Here he was known as the “Black Dragon” The isolation would allow the kickboxer to focus solely on becoming a better fighter Before returning to New Zealand in 2014 he fought 24 times in China winning every bout Within the next year and a half in his respected home of New Zealand Adesanya would win The King in the Ring Tournament three times He won the title at 190pounds defended that title once and then won the belt once more at heavyweight He went 90 earning the most titles in King in the Ring tournament history As a professional boxer Adesanya would go 51 from 20142015 dropping his inaugural fight against Daneil Ammann in a controversial decision “The Last Stylebender” was born and the unique dancing entrances began Adesanya showed quick footwork the ability to pick well timed shots endurance arrogance and sportsmanship He backed up this cocky attitude with unprecedented talent often knocking opponents out or beating them into submission King in the Ring Trans Tasman 8 Man Quarter Final 3 Kim Loudon vs Israel Adesanya Watch this video on YouTube King in the Ring 86II Quarter Final 1 Israel Adesanya vs Slava Alexeichik Watch this video on YouTube Adesanya and Bareman had goals that traveled far beyond the world of professional kickboxing In 2015 Adesanya DM’d Dana White on Twitter and told him to just get him into the octagon and he would do the rest From 20122015 the AfricanKiwi managed to sneak in a 50 record in MMA with TKOs over all five opponents At the same time he signed a deal with Glory kickboxing Adesanya was 24 years old when he lost his debut fight to Belgian kickboxer Filip Verlinden in Istanbul Turkey This was only the second loss of his kickboxing career and he would quickly avenge it when he defeated Verlinden three months later at Glory of Heroes 3 In 2016 Adesanya became the Glory Middleweight Tournament Champion defeating Yousri Belgaroui by split decision He won four MMA fights that same year in China all by stoppage bringing his professional record to a perfect 90 with 9 TKOs He’s always been an active busy fighter in and out of the cage On July 28 2017 Adesanya finally got his shot at a former UFC veteran with a familiar name He won the AFC Middleweight Championship in Melbourne Australia over Melvin Guillard after punishing him for the entire first round The TKO victory was his tenth leaving Israel with one more stop to make before he entered the UFC As if it wasn’t evident enough that Adesanya was clearly capable of holding his own at the highest level he delivered a beautiful question mark kick to the head of Stuart Dare at Hex Fighting Series 12 on November 24 2017 Adesanya hears the resounding noise of the sticks clapping together to mark the final ten seconds of the round aims and fires his most devastating weapon Hex 12 Israel Adesanyas Huge Knockout Watch this video on YouTube At UFC 221 Adesanya would make his long awaited debut against Rob Wilkinson He was 110 in MMA with 11 finishes he accrued more time in kickboxing than you can keep track of and he even tested his skills at professional boxing Adesanya was about to officially unleash “The Last Stylebender” for the entire world to see The UFC’s new star planned to captivate the audience in his debut After spending the first round trying not to get taken down Adesanya dismantled Wilkinson in the second He showed glimpses of the swagger he was known for as he crippled Wilkinson with hard right hands and knees to the body Adesanya stopped 12 of 15 takedowns in the fight as well proving he polished more than just his striking The win also earned him his first UFC performance of the night bonus Israel Adesanya made his UFC debut two years ago today at UFC 221 Adesanya finished Rob Wilkinson in the second round via TKO What a crazy two years it has been for him UFC pictwittercomwkZTzxhXDJ — Jon Realejo BloodyCanvasJon February 11 2020 After the fight Adesanya grabbed the mic and made his intentions real clear “Middleweights I’m the new dog in the yard and I just pissed all over this cage” Never seen this video of Adesanya before This is moments after his debut 2 years ago Look at the emotion Wow pictwittercom8y5BGNjCPS — Ariel Helwani arielhelwani March 4 2020 At UFC Fight Night Poirier vs Gaethje in April of 2018 Adesanya would fight for 15 minutes for the first time in his professional MMA career against Marvin Vettori He had never gone to a decision never mind fight in a grinder against a prospect from Italy four years younger than him He won the fight via split decision but it didn’t come without adversity due to the toughasnails approach Vettori brought to the bout After the fight the 130 Adesanya said “A wins a win but I’m not happy with it” After two successful fights in the UFC Israel Adesanya would headline The Ultimate Fighter Undefeated Finale just three months removed from his fight with Vettori This time Brad Tavares was on the menu and he was fresh off of a four fight win streak For the second time in his career Adesanya would go the distance but this time it was five rounds The bout was rather onesided and Israel earned his second performance of the night bonus Israel Adesanya put on a dominant performance against Brad Tavares in the TUF27Finale main event Check out the photos httpstcodRLUEvf8Fp pictwittercom2IJc9TzkAs — MMA Junkie MMAjunkie July 7

Stylebender finishes Brunson in round 1 UFC230 pictwittercomWGu676jNr6 — UFC ufc November 4 2018 When you rise to fame and rise quickly sometimes your idols become your rivals It’s just the way things go in life and especially in sports Such was the case for Adesanya when he fought longtime idol Anderson Silva in his next bout at UFC 234 The fight was scheduled to be the comain event of the evening but due to an injury with Robert Whittaker he was forced to pull out of the fight putting Adesanya vs Silva as the main event Adesanya won the fight via unanimous decision and earned himself his first fight of the night bonus The matrix style of parrying and feinting the two displayed in the octagon looked like the dancing culture that Adesanya had come from a similar culture to the capoeira style Brazil loves Everyone has their opinion of the Adesanya Silva fight I grew up with Anderson Silva being like a hero to me he seemed invincible for quite a while To see this new prodigy whose meteoric rise catapulted him to fight a legend of the sport like Anderson before he retired was truly spectacular Now at 160 Adesanya would have a chance to fight for the interim UFC Middleweight Championship Bareman and Adesanya’s hefty goal of becoming UFC champion was finally on the brink of becoming reality Kelvin Gastelum and Adesanya would meet in Atlanta Georgia at UFC 236 in what many would call the fight of the year The winner of the bout knew they would have to unify their title with Robert Whittaker’s What they didn’t know was the cost at which it would come The fight went all five rounds and was an absolute war In the first round alone Adesanya experienced more adversity in the striking realm than he had his entire career By the end of the fifth the judges scored the fight 48–46 48–46

Adesanya stylebender April 17 2019 The title unification bout would take place October 6 2019 at the Marvel Stadium in Melbourne Australia Adesanya walked out to the octagon in front of a record breaking 57127 people along with three of his childhood friends He expressed himself through a choreographed dance upon his entrance that up until that point would have been frowned upon by Dana White Izzy made it work in fact just like he did at the talent shows years before he crushed it In the fight Adesanya would not only drop Whittaker once but twice The first time came at the ringing of the bell in round one and the second time was when he finished Whittaker at 333 of round two Rob lunged forward with a few telegraphed shots that Adesanya was able to counter very well displaying his unique balance and movement once again Less than two years into his UFC career Adesanya became the UFC Middleweight Champion DC said during the fight “He’s got Rob chasing him and he’s just sliding out of range Not going far away from Whittaker but just enough for him to re establish and take the center of the octagon” ✨👑✨ “Sometimes fame and money could change everything” Love me or hate me you’re all gonna pay me I’m not even talking money You’ll pay attention 🧠 💵 2020vision rinnegan 👁 pictwittercomhtBXGm4JUz — Israel Adesanya stylebender January 16 2020 It was a masterful performance that was followed by Adesanya winning the 2019 Sportsman of the Year Award for New Zealand After Adesanya beat Whittaker he pointed out that he managed to do in two rounds what Yoel Romero failed to do in ten Due to an injury to number one contender Paulo Costa that’s exactly who Adesanya got Yoel Romero He won the fight at UFC 248 via unanimous decision in what I refer to as an intelligent career choice Adesanya didn’t play into the crowds antagonization or the games of Romero and because of that he successfully walked away with his belt 😂😂😂 pictwittercomLkFhSJ0SgX — Israel Adesanya stylebender March 8 2020 Adesanya told Eugene Bareman that the best advice his mentor had ever given him was that “It always works out” It’s simple but it’s a mindset that help carry Adesanya from a young and wild kickboxer to a young and wild UFC world champion Not much has changed with Izzy He’s still a world class athlete and great teammate he still travels the world and gets paid to “whoop ass” as he says He’s still loyal to his mentor his beloved family and CKB and he still has goals far beyond what we can predict Adesanya told MMAJunkie back in 2016 “All I know is I’m working If you want to beat me you better do it yesterday because every expletive day I’m getting better” He said by his fourth MMA fight he knew he was going to be the best he knew he could be the greatest “Give me smaller gloves and give me different styles and I will beat these guys” Adesanya made good on his word and he’s beat everyone in his path So what’s next for the Last Stylebender A little bit of quarantine and then hopefully Paulo Costa Distances myself from society “What y’all fake outraged about today” ☕️🐸 pictwittercomWnyVaIHKZn — Israel Adesanya stylebender March 24 2020 Adesanya is

international accounts are calculated to be worth between 100 billion 1 2 and 120 billion 3 4 Almost 1973 billion of Irans assets are frozen in the United States 5 According to the Congressional Research Service in addition to the money locked up in foreign bank accounts Irans frozen assets include real estate and other property The estimated value of Irans real estate in the US and their accumulated rent is 50 million 1 Besides the assets frozen in the US some parts of Irans assets are frozen around the world by the United Nations 1 As of January 2021 Iran had frozen assets in the following countries 7 billion in South Korea 6 billion in Iraq 20 billion in China 15 billion in Japan 16 billion in Luxembourg 6 Contents 1 Background 2 After nuclear negotiations 3 Seizure of Iranian assets 4 See also 5 References Background Edit Irans assets were first frozen by US president Jimmy Carter in 1979 after revolutionaries overthrew the USallied Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi s administration and took American hostages After the Iranian Revolution in 1979 the United States ended its economic and diplomatic ties with Iran banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately 11 billion 1980US dollars of its assets 7 Many of the assets were then unfrozen in 1981 after the Algiers Accords were signed and the hostage crisis ended dubious – discuss At the time of the 1979 revolution the Pentagon resold some 400 million in Iranian military equipment already paid for by the deposed government and the money was placed in an escrow account 1 Much of the frozen cash includes Irans income from selling a limited amount of oil prior to the lifting of the sanctions when Iran could legally sell oil but could not transfer the money back to Iran because doing so was illegal under US sanctions 2 After nuclear negotiations Edit Some pages of the JCPOA were dedicated to the listing of individuals and entities whose assets would be unfrozen 1 According to Nader Habibi a professor of economics at Brandeis University JCPOA will lead to the release of only about 30 billion worth of assets a similar figure of about 32 billion was estimated by Valiollah Seif the chief of Irans central bank 2 According to the Washington Institute in 2015 8 the predeal asset freeze did not have as great an impact on the Iranian government as some statements from Washington suggested And going forward the postdeal relaxation of restrictions will not have as great an impact as some critics of the deal suggest The US government also has seized a Manhattan skyscraper belonging to the Iranian government worth over a billion US dollars Seizure of Iranian assets Edit Main article Bank Markazi v Peterson Deborah Peterson and other plaintiffs brought a lawsuit in US federal court against the Islamic Republic of Iran and obtained a judgments against Iran for its role in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings in which 241 Marines were killed and for other acts of international terrorism While foreign states usually enjoy immunity from claims in court the plaintiffs invoked an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 that allows foreign states to be held liable for acts of statesponsored terrorism 9 The central bank of Iran Bank Markazi challenged the execution of the judgment on various grounds However in 2012 Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 which specified that the judgment in the Peterson et al v Islamic Republic of Iran et al would be subject to execution and also abolished Bank Markazi to the execution of judgment 9 Bank Markazi challenged this statute as unconstitutional arguing that Congress had unduly interfered with a judicial function by intervening in a specific case however the US Supreme Court in Bank Markazi v Peterson ruled 72 that Congresss act was constitutional 9 Iran had denied any involvement in any of the bombings 10

Profile then View saved stories Lung cancer Coloured Xray of the chest of an 84 year old woman with a malignant cancerous tumour yellow in the apex of the right lung top left DU CANE MEDICAL IMAGING LTDGetty Images Cuba has for several years had a promising therapeutic vaccine against lung cancer The 55year trade embargo led by the US made sure that Cuba was mostly where it stayed Untilmaybenow The Obama administration has of course been trying to normalize relations with the island nation And last month during New York Gov Andrew Cuomos visit to Havana Roswell Park Cancer Institute finalized an agreement with Cubas Center for Molecular Immunology to develop a lung cancer vaccine and begin clinical trials in the US Essentially US researchers will bring the Cimavax vaccine stateside and get on track for approval by the Food and Drug Administration The chance to evaluate a vaccine like this is a very exciting prospect says Candace Johnson CEO of Roswell Park Shes excited most likely because research on the vaccine so far shows that it has low toxicity and its relatively cheap to produce and store The Center for Molecular Immunology will give Roswell Park all of the documentation how its produced toxicity data results from past trials for an FDA drug application Johnson says she hopes to get approval for testing Cimavax within six to eight months and to start clinical trials in a year How did Cuba end up with a cutting edge immunooncology drug Though the country is justly famous for cigars rum and baseball it also has some of the best and most inventive biotech and medical research in the world Thats especially notable for a country where the average worker earns 20 a month Cuba spends a fraction of the money the US does on healthcare per individual yet the average Cuban has a life expectancy on par with the average American Theyve had to do more with less says Johnson so theyve had to be even more innovative with how they approach things For over 40 years they have had a preeminent immunology community Despite decades of economic sanctions Fidel and Raul Castro made biotechnology and medical research particularly preventative medicine a priority After the 1981 dengue fever outbreak struck nearly 350000 Cubans the government established the Biological Front an effort to focus research efforts by various agencies toward specific goals Its first major accomplishment was the successful and unexpected production of interferon a protein that plays a role in human immune response Since then Cuban immunologists made several other vaccination breakthroughs including their own vaccines for meningitis B and hepatitis B and monoclonal antibodies for kidney transplants The thing about making such great cigars is smoking is really really bad for you Lung cancer is the fourthleading cause of the death in Cuba Medical researchers at the Center for Molecular Immunology worked on Cimavax for 25 years before the Ministry of Health made it available to the publicfor freein 2011 Each shot costs the government about 1 A Phase II trial from 2008 showed lung cancer patients who received the vaccine lived an average of four to six months longer than those who didnt That prompted Japan and some European countries to initiate Cimavax clinical trials as well To be fair Cimavax probably wont be a gamechanging cancer drug in its current form The vaccine doesnt attack tumors directly instead going after a protein that tumors produce which then circulates in the blood That action spurs a persons body to release antibodies against a hormone called epidermal growth factor which typically spurs cell growth but can also if unchecked cause cancer Although most people normally think of a vaccine as something that prevents a disease technically a vaccine is a substance that stimulates the immune system in some way So the point of Cimavax is to keep lung tumors from growing and metastasizing turning a latestage growth into something chronic but manageable But in the US and Europe people with lung cancer already have treatment options with the same goal Roswell Park researchers say they plan to explore the vaccines potential as a preventative interventionmaking it more like a traditional vaccine Furthermore epidermal growth factor plays an important role in many other cancers like prostate breast colon and pancreatic cancer All those things are potential targets for this vaccine says Kelvin Lee an immunologist at the company Mostly for financial reasons Cubans didnt test Cimavax that way at all And that drug isnt the only one with potential in the Cuban pharmacopeia Thomas Rothstein a biologist at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research has for six years worked with the Center for Molecular Immunology on another vaccine to treat lung cancer called Racotumomab with an entirely different mechanism It messes with a particular lipid found in tumor cell membranes Investigators from around the world are trying to crack the nut of cancer Rothstein says The Cubans are thinking in ways that are novel and clever Although President Obama has used his executive power to lift some restrictions against medical and research equipment Congress must lift the Cuban embargo before collaborative research can ramp up Johnson hopes to see Cuba embrace more entrepreneurialism in science and see the US soak up more creative approaches to medical research Constrained by politics the Cuban researchers had to innovate in ways the US and Europe did not Now maybe theyll be able to teach their colleagues what they learned Topics cancer medicine vaccines WIRED is where tomorrow is realized It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant

Please try again later More content below Xi Jinping Helen Raleigh December 28 2020 630 AM · 6 min read Oops Something went wrong Please try again later More content below Xi Jinping The following is an adapted excerpt from Helen Raleigh’s new book Backlash How China’s Aggression Has Backfired T he Chinese Communist Party’s leader Xi Jinping is the most powerful leader in Communist China since Chairman Mao Yet Xi’s outward strongman image is a veneer over his inner insecurity When he came into power in late 2012 China’s economy had slowed down from doubledigit growth to singledigit growth the mass workingage population which had been the engine of China ’ s economic growth has begun to decline The Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS a Washington DC–based think tank projects that by 2030 “China will round out its thinning labor force by hiring workers from abroad” At the same time according to Mark Haas a politicalscience professor at Duquesne University “China alone in 2050 will have more than 329 million people over 65” Consequently China is expected to be the first major economy that will grow older before it achieves widespread prosperity Without its demographic dividend and with an aging population China’s economic growth will further slow down at the time when the government needs to keep its growing middle class from demanding a level of political freedom matching their newfound wealth An aging population would also force the government to allocate more national resources for elder care and social services which means there will be fewer resources to compete against the US This is probably one of the most important reasons why Xi feels that he has to abandon the socalled strategicpatience guidance issued by Deng Xiaoping the paramount leader of China from 1978 to 1997 who instructed his comrades to bide their time and avoid any confrontation with powerful external forces until China was in a much stronger position both economically and militarily Xi however believes that China can’t afford to bide its time any longer It must replace the liberal world order with a Sinocentric world order before China ’ s population becomes too old and the Chinese economy becomes too stagnant However rather than furthering economic reform and opening up more sectors to foreign investment and competition to strengthen its economy Xi chose to hide China’s weaknesses and exaggerate China’s economic strengths He emphasizes selfreliance and utilizing China’s resources to pump up “national champions” or stateowned enterprises that could compete against global leaders in strategic sectors Xi feels that nationalism is his new trump card something he can use to motivate excite and unite a billion people all the while strengthening the CCP’s rule over them Others say that his inwardlooking nationalist policies are leading China to the very middleincome trap — in which China’s level of development stalls out before reaching the heights of other modern industrial nations — that Xi and his predecessors tried very hard to avoid Story continues Yet the more the Chinese economy slows down the more Xi feels the need to project a strongman image both abroad and especially at home As Wang Gungwu and Zheng Yongnian two Chinese scholars wrote in China and the New International Order this dynamic has deep roots in Chinese history “China’s internal order was so closely related to her international order that one could not long survive without the other when the barbarians were not submissive abroad rebels might more easily arise within Most dynasties collapsed under the twin blows of inside disorder and outside calamity nei luan wai hu a n g that is domestic rebellion and foreign invasion” Xi is keenly aware that he is vulnerable to internal rebellion He has purged more than 15 million government officials military leaders and party elites His trade war with the US is deeply unpopular inside China because it has caused economic pains such as rising unemployment closing of factories and the shifting of the global supply chain out of China Xi knows very well that if he shows any signs of weakness he may end up like his political rival Bo Xilai — a princeling who is currently languishing in a notorious Chinese prison for highlevel party officials In addition Xi saw former US President Obama as a “weak” leader who led a nation that was on its way to inevitable decline which opened up an unprecedented opportunity for China Xi also has certain milestones he wants to reach In 2021 the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and in 2049 the 100th anniversary of the founding of Communist China Xi wants to do something big to cement his place in history when he reaches these milestones Therefore in his mind the era of hiding strength and biding time is over He wants to show the world a new set of policies actions and attitudes that match China’s powerful status For a while Xi was succeeding Internally he ruthlessly cracked down on religious believers political dissenters party officials and business elites He also built a mass surveillance state that turned the dystopian nightmare imagined by George Orwell’s 1984 into a reality Internationally he imposed his strong will on businesses and nations big and small through his signature project “One Belt and One Road” The way Xi sees it the more other countries become economically dependent on China the more he can dominate them peacefully without having to use force One commentator has observed that Xi “resembles a clenched fist At home he is clenching hard to assert his control To the outside world he is a hardthrusting force determined to get his way” Xi’s fist has conditioned many nations including the Western democracies to believe that China is stronger than it actually is and that China’s global dominance is inevitable Therefore few are willing to challenge China’s humanrights violations at home and its assertive behavior abroad But even the most powerful emperor can fly too close to the sun The dissenting voices inside China are getting louder while global backlash against China reached new heights in 2019 Then the 2020 coronavirus outbreak stripped the facade of Xi’s powerful image revealed deep flaws within the CCP’s dictatorial political system caused immense anger and frustration among Chinese people brought serious detriments to China’s prestigious international image and brought China’s seemingly unstoppable rise to a halt As the prominent Hong Kong entrepreneur Jimmy Lai has written “The more Mr Xi pursues his authoritarian agenda the more distrust he will sow at home and abroad Far from transforming Beijing into the world’s leading superpower his policies will instead keep China from taking its rightful place of honor in a peaceful modern and integrated world” Xi has misread the situation overplayed his hand and his aggressive policies at home and abroad have backfired proving the saying Those whom the gods would destroy they first make mad More from National Review Wolf Warrior II Tells Us a Lot about China Do Autocracies Really Have

with me Never mind that as one of the finest baritones in the world his booming voice makes it hard to be discreet“The truth about opera singers is that food and drinks are pretty much the only topic we discuss When they know you’ve been hired to sing in a new opera house your musician friends will give you their list” he tells me “Where to get the best täffelspitz with cream spinach if you’re in Vienna The address of Pavarotti’s cook in Genova The best wine bar in Madrid Believe me nobody knows food and drinks like an opera singer”Can the Roaring Twenties Teach Us About PostPandemic LifeHow to Avoid Overhyped and Overpriced BourbonSuch is the unconventional life of travel led by opera singers or at least was before the spread of Covid19 And that life also came with its spells of homesickness “I remember my debut at the Met” says Tézier “It was the year 2000 and I was singing Escamillo in Carmen I loved New York City right away but food wise it was challenging The Parmigiano cheese I found at my local supermarket was from Cincinnati So when my American agent asked me to stay one more week for a televised concert—the opportunity of a lifetime she insisted—I said no way I’m out of here I need to go back home for real cheese She thought I was nuts Obviously the New York food scene has changed a lot since then only for the better”In the last 20 years 52year old Tézier has been back at the Metropolitan Opera many times most notably in Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor as the main character’s villainous father This 2011 production is currently available for streaming on the Met’s websiteIn December providing Lincoln Center reopens in time Tézier is set to sing the tragic title role in Rigoletto one of Verdi’s finest operas The great Italian composer is very much on Tézier’s mind these days as shown by his exquisite first solo album simply titled Verdi Sony Classical which was just released this winter “We recorded in Bologna which is one of the very best places to eat and drink in the world I mean Luciano Pavarotti grew up a few miles away in Modena That says it all”For Tézier his love of food and drink began by the Mediterranean where he grew up on France’s beautiful coast He still speaks with a warm and musical accent common in his hometown of Marseilles “What really rocked my world was a summer holiday in the Gers region that’s in the Southwest of France We were staying on a farm and believe me there was a depth of knowledge there” he recalls “I remember this woman beautifullynamed Zélie What a cook She prepared zucchini flowers fritters that were heavenly With the male flowers mind you because if you use the females you ruin the chain of reproduction And she made incredible pastries in her wood oven The thin dough was filled with crab apples in an Armagnac sauce” GREGOR HOHENBERGSONY MUSIC Since then the famed brandy has remained a personal favorite of his “I remember the locals pouring Armagnac in balloon glasses savoring it and talking about the variety of tastes they perceived I remember the wonderful vanillalike smell of the alcohol maturing in the oak barrels And seeing the transparent color of the unaged brandy presented in a thimble for everybody to admire and the mahogany colors of the mature one Beautiful memories”Is there a vocal benefit to drinking before a concert or is liquor a singing hazard “We’ve all heard the urban legends” Tézier admits “Namely that you should drink whiskey to get a lower register or a glass of Bordeaux to lubricate the vocal cords Personally I don’t do any of it for the same reason that an athlete doesn’t drink before a game Alcohol stiffens the muscles and that’s all the vocal cords are it’s pretty simple So I enjoy a nice drink after a show or on my downtime in Alsace”Mangia Inside Luciano Pavarotti’s Italian KitchenTézier his wife the soprano Cassandre Berthon and their young son have settled into a house near wine country in Dorlisheim which is not too far from Strasburg “A guy from Marseilles who finds a home in Alsace it’s not that common but it’s my story” says Tézier “I’m in awe of the savoir faire of these winemakers who are our neighbors I can recommend the Rangen de Thann for instance a wonderful joyous white wine It is also a rarity because the workers have to rope down the hill to collect the grapes A wine like that can produce in you great emotions Pretty much like music There is great music all around…and then there is Mozart”So if Rangen de Thann goes with Mozart then what do you drink while listening to Verdi’s operas Tézier doesn’t miss a beat “A glass of Amarone della Valpolicella” he says “Spicy and deep with a touch of a violent beastly feeling to it…That wine is pure Verdi”Read more at The Daily BeastGet our top

Biden’s cabinet meeting proves the reality TV presidency wasnt renewed Biden’s first full cabinet meeting was a return to the staid old way of doing things – not worshipping the president like Trump’s cabinet Joe Biden speaks during a cabinet meeting in the East Room of the White House as Antony Blinken left and Lloyd Austin right listen Photograph Evan VucciAP Poor old Joe Biden He might have won the electoral college and the popular vote but he’ll never feel the love of his underlings like Donald Trump did The former president’s first full cabinet meeting in June 2017 remains an unparalleled opera of oleaginousness Secretary after secretary all but flung themselves at his feet sang songs of praise and paid homage to the divine emperor of the universe Has any parent ever known such undying adoration from their child Only King Lear from Goneril and Regan perhaps And most telling was the fact that the world was allowed to see it Trump made sure it was one more chapter in his reality TV presidency Not really Biden’s style His first cabinet meeting on Thursday was relocated to the East Room because of coronavirus restrictions – the 16 permanent members wore face masks and sat in a giant square with empty chairs between them – but was otherwise a return to the staid old way of doing things The main item on the agenda was not the American president’s sculpted handsomeness nor his towering intellect nor his indubitable virility nor his ability to hit holes in one but merely his freshly announced 2tn infrastructure plan Flanked by the secretary of state Antony Blinken and the defense secretary Lloyd Austin with the vicepresident Kamala Harris opposite Biden said he was asking five cabinet members to “take special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public” He took no questions from the media and after less than two and a half minutes reporters were ushered out “I thank the press for being here but I’ll talk to you all later” The 16 permanent members wore face masks and sat in a giant square with empty chairs between them Photograph Leigh VogelEPA But even this brief glimpse behind the curtain spoke volumes about how much has changed White men composed nearly threequarters of Trump’s cabinet they make up only a third of Biden’s On Thursday the East Room included Harris the first woman and first woman of colour to serve as vicepresident Janet Yellen the first woman to lead the treasury department Pete Buttigieg the first openly gay secretary confirmed to the cabinet and Deb Haaland the first Native American in a president’s cabinet “This is the first in American history that the cabinet looks like America” Biden said “That’s what we promised we were going to do and we’ve done it” If Trump represented a backlash against America’s first Black president Biden’s cabinet represents a backlash against the backlash Their refusal to play to the cameras with ever escalating sycophancy was also a reminder that the reality TV presidency did not get renewed for a second season Ratings are down and such is the absence of scandals Biden’s pet dogs are making news for biting people and depositing poo in a White House hallway Cabinet members like Tom Vilsack and Denis McDonough simply can’t compete with Ben Carson or Rick Perry for comic effect Spare a thought for the latenight comedians suddenly going cold turkey How they feasted on that first Trump cabinet meeting which began with Mike Pence declaring that it was “the greatest privilege of my life to serve as the vicepresident to the president who is keeping his word to the American people” Reince Priebus the White House chief of staff followed up “We thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda” As Trump went around the room nearly every secretary strove to outdo the one before in the olympics of obsequiousness Latenight comedian Stephen Colbert summed up “These are adults some of them are billionaires and they’re just happy to have their leashes yanked as the cameras roll for the dear leader “I did not know that Trump has such a strict ‘please check your balls at the door’ policy Honestly this is nextlevel weird This is an unprecedented public strokefest for an emotionally frail man” It was of course funny until it wasn’t In a country where politics is the new religion with all its faith and fervour and absolutes worship of that particular Messiah led all the way to the deadly storming of the US Capitol on 6 January Ordinary Joe is more in the vein of Bertolt Brecht unhappy the land that is in need

about in one form or another for years It seems reasonable to me to be looking to develop vaccines and ‘cures’ The patents reflect the reality of how work like this is performed within the neoliberal

above by Rogue is unsourced unverified fearmongering propaganda This is a false flag operation just like the Gulf of Tonkin or Sandy Hook Be smarter than an NPC 12 Rogue on February 4 2020 at 156 am Below is a listing of analytical analysis of the WuHan Virus genome showing suspected 4 gene splices of HIV into the Genome of the virus httpswwwbiorxivorgcontent10110120200130927871v1full Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019nCoV spike protein to HIV1 gp120 and Gag oi httpsdoiorg10110120200130927871 Abstract are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019nCoV The evolution of 2019nCoV remains elusive We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein S which are unique to the 2019nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses Importantly amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV1 gp120 or HIV1 Gag Interestingly despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence 3Dmodelling of the 2019nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019nCoV all of which have identity similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature This work provides yet unknown insights on 2019nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus” Full article has been removed and is not peer reviewed above link is still up to the full study Article comes down to suspected gene splicing of 4 HIV sequences into samples of 2019nCOV linked to mucus transmission of virus Other reports showing possible water transmission via feces and live virus can be picked up from surfaces So if verified it is a very dangerous weapon Developed for massive transmission from all routes While possible false flag it is more likely that it is an escaped modified virus from the Wuhan bioweopens Lab This would explain the fast spread and massive quarantine of China Because once the Party Leaders became aware the situation and its impacts to the population and economic possibilities world wide This would be in keeping with the chimera development and experimentation going on in China Even if Gates et al have the patent for the virus it does not mean the one released is the same one or that there exist an effective antidote inoculation or treatment for for this escaped strain If this was a planned event or accident at this point is a mute consideration what is germane is what preparations can we take now for ourselves and families 13 Our Spirit on February 1 2020 at 807 pm Propaganda It’s just a type of flu Use Purrell on your hands Keep unwashed hands away from facial

pharmaceutical industry is corrupt to the core The three biggest scams are 3 low population shortterm Phase III clinical trials for marketing approval A typical trial would be 600 subjects in an active drug arm and 600 subjects in a placebo arm for 12 weeks This is designed to not detect rare serious side effects some fatal say with a 1 in 2000 incidence after say 6 to 9 months of therapy This is how drugs like Avandia and Vioxx rake in billions of dollars in revenue before they’re pulled due to serious side effects or death Postmarketing surveillance is cumbersome so many doctors do not report serious side effects 2 PhRMA owns Congress When half wit GW Bush was president he and known serial pedo House Speaker Denny Hastert who was made Speaker due to being completely controllable and flip flopper swamp creature from Louisiana Billy Tauzin allowed PhRMA to write the MMA which was a give away to the drug companies Tauzin retired to collect his legal brine of a 1 million salary

MD indicated it was a man made binary weapon He treated it with several strong courses of antibiotics that repeated because the mycoplasma was found inside the nucleus of white blood cells and could not be detected by routine blood tests It replicated with each new cell One opinion was that when mycoplasma incognitis meets HIV equals AIDS RNA recombinant and vector are words that keep me away

poison gas trenches Civilian death tolls were exorbitant but never mentioned in US UK or France until 20000 died in Madrid hence “Spanish Flu” Most of the adult deaths were related to recently

Douglas and Michael will be doing an audio on this exact topic in a few days The researchers have more info to bring up from the mines before discussing the topic 39 duaneemagictravelcom on January 28 2020 at 750 pm Can Douglas provide an explanation of how a virus is a patentable entity Creating a virus and then creating a vaccination for that virus seems unethical Why patent the virus when it would only seem necessary to create and disseminate the virus and then provide a patent for the vaccine That way there is no trail to the formation which suggests distribution with the intent to cause a disease and a follow up vaccine to correct which never should have been produced to begin with 40 Godbewithusblog on January 28 2020 at 745 pm Thanks for digging this up😊💜👊 41 j on January 28 2020

flight 5 Former Minneapolis cops trial in George Floyds murder gets underway Insight The United States has intervened hundreds of times in the affairs of Latin American countries—from spying and proxy wars to major military invasions Here are the top 8 In light of the current political crisis in Venezuela a United Statessupported opposition figure has announced a disputed presidency It follows an attempted coup by national guard members after the country’s Supreme Court rejected a declaration by an oppositioncontrolled legislature that Nicolas Maduro’s presidency was illegitimate US support for the opposition is not new In 2017 then CIA director Mike Pompeo commented that he was “hopeful that there can be a transition in Venezuela and we the CIA is doing its best to understand the dynamic there” Against a backdrop of US interventions forced regime change and military coups in Latin America the CIA director’s words reflect an established approach for the United States in dealing with its southern neighbours often away from the public eye and motivated by big business economic interest and ideology Here are eight of the most notorious cases of US interference in Latin America 1 Guatemala The United Fruit Company UFCO was a highly successful American company that made major profits from bananas grown in Latin America and sold in the United States and Europe Under Guatemalan dictator Jorge Ubico the UFCO controlled 42 percent of Guatemala’s land and was exempt from tax and import duties The company owned all of Guatemalas banana production monopolised banana exports and also owned the countrys telephone and telegraph system as well as almost all of its railroad track while brutally repressing farm owners In 1944 the rightwing dictator Ubico was removed following the Guatemalan Revolution as the country saw its first democratic election in history In 1951 after another election Colonel Jacobo Arbez became president and extended political freedoms to all allowing communists to enter politics The United States was alarmed by the alleged spread of communism and further by President Arbenz’s proposed ‘Decree 900’ which would allow the redistribution of undeveloped lands held by large property owners to landless farmers making up 90 percent of the population Arbenz believed this was critical because at the time only two percent of landowners owned 70 percent of the land while farmers worked in a form of debt slavery The United Fruit Company took an extreme position towards these reforms and made use of its strong ties to the Eisenhower administration to launch a massive anticommunist propaganda campaign against Guatemala Following extensive lobbying President Eisenhower chose to make use of the CIA to remove President Arbenz in what came to be known as operation PBSUCCESS The CIA would go on to orchestrate a coup against the sitting president building arming and training an opposition force to overthrow him Arbenz was overthrown and Guatemala was ruled by a military dictatorship for 40 years During that time nearly 250000 Guatemalans were killed or ‘disappeared’ 2 Chile’s brutal Pinochet regime After the democratic election of President Salvador Allende who had ties to the Cuban Castro government in 1970 US President Richard Nixon ordered an economic war against Chile This would be followed by a CIAinstigated coup against Allende in 1973 by General Augusto Pinochet Following the coup Pinochet’s regime would become one of the most oppressive and brutal military regimes of the 20th Century The US supported Pinochet’s military dictatorship for decades Pinochet banned political parties dissolved congress and scrapped the constitution He also censored the press banned unions permitted torture and repression and according to one government report killed nearly 28000 people during his rule 3 Invasion of Grenada Grenada is a small Caribbean island 150 km north of Venezuela In 1979 a revolution led by Maurice Bishop succeeded with Cuban support One of his projects was the construction of a large airstrip which US President Reagan claimed was designed for Soviet aircraft During an internal power struggle while 800 US medical students were on the island Reagan used the unrest as justification for ordering an invasion On October 25 1983 10000 US Jamaican and Caribbean troops invaded the island in a move that killed over 100 civilians and was condemned internationally by the UN General Assembly 4 Panama Before Panama sought independence from Greater Colombia the Colombian government was negotiating with the US to build a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans With the failure of negotiations the US supported a separatist movement in Panama Once the country gained independence French businessman Phillip BurnauVarilla sold his rights to building the Panama Canal to the US government As a result the US demanded full control of the canal and a 97 km zone around it In the 1970s the CIA would go on to recruit General Manuel Noriega who had previously run the country’s secret police until his president’s sudden death in a plane crash He went on to help Colombian drug trafficker Pablo Escobar smuggle cocaine as well as helping the US smuggle weapons to Nicaraguan Contra death squads in what would later come to be known as the IranContra affair It was only when Noriega outlived his usefulness that he would be overthrown by the US in 1990 and arrested for corruption racketeering and drug smuggling 5 Nicaragua The US occupied Nicaragua in 1912 going on to acquire rights to build a supposed ‘Nicaragua Canal’ from the USbacked Chamorro family General Augusto Sandino led a rebellion against the conservative government and US occupation Sandino was later assassinated and followed by the USbacked Somoza dictatorship Not long after the Sandinista revolution overthrew the USbacked Somoza dictatorship and faced off against the USsponsored Contra guerrilla rebels This would later be publicised as the IranContra affair In a black book operation during the Reagan administration in 1985 the US sold 1500 missiles to Iran in exchange for seven American hostages Much of the 30 million paid by Iran for the weapons went to fund the Contras 6 Argentina In 1976 Argentina’s democratically elected President Isabel Peron was overthrown in a military coup d’etat that lead to the deaths of nearly 30000 The coup was supported and endorsed by the United States government with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger going to visit the newlyinstalled dictatorship several times The USendorsed dictatorship committed grievous human rights violations while in power Crimes included mass execution extrajudicial arrest torture and rape as well as the relocation of children born of pregnant detainees before imprisonment after continuous rape Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon would later rule that Kissinger was a witness to such crimes 7 Brazil In 1964 President John F Kennedy backed a coup d’etat against Brazilian President Joao Goulart “to prevent Brazil from becoming another Cuba” Brazil’s return to democracy would see several rightwing hardliner governments come to power resulting in deep inequality and extreme poverty for the country that continues to affect it to the present day 8 Cuba In exchange for Cuba’s independence the US forced the newlyindependent nation to include the Platt Amendment in its new constitution The Platt Amendment prevented Cuba from leasing land to any country but the US allowed for US intervention in Cuban affairs and forbade it from negotiating any treaties with anyone but the US The Platt Amendment would also set the basis for leasing Guantanamo Bay to the US allowing them to carry out extrajudicial torture on foreign soil In 1959 Fidel Castro overthrew the USbacked military Batista government in power causing alarm in the US over his explicit communist agenda and links to the Soviet Union The Batista government opened Havana to US investment and tax refuge exploitative tourism organised crime syndicates and drugs and announced that it would match dollar for dollar any investment over 1

is the second leading cause of death and the primary cause of years of potential life lost making a significant impact on life expectancy at birth Lung cancer is the malignant disease with highest incidence and also the leading cause of cancer mortality in the country In 2005–2007 an average of 4234 new lung cancer cases and 4601 deaths from the disease were reported annually for a crude mortality rate of 543 men and 273 women per 100000 population If present demographic trends and risk factors persist lung cancer incidence and mortality can be expected to rise significantly in Cuba in the next five years1 Recognizing rising cancer incidence and mortality as a major public health problem the Cuban Ministry of Public Health has implemented a Comprehensive Cancer Control Program PICC its acronym in Spanish operating across all levels of the national public health system This program constitutes a new therapeutic approach to the disease with biotechnology serving as a bridge between basic immunology research and public health In Cuba biotechnological research and development is conceived as a complete scientific cycle closed loop from concept to clinical application and marketing of scientific products Income from product sales is invested in both sustaining use of immunotherapies in the national public health system and in research and development of new immunotherapeutic modalities23 Although chemotherapies have become an indispensable arsenal for reducing tumor burden and extending survival their impact on lung cancer is measurable only in months with the added burden of severe adverse reactions Lung cancer patients generally confront an initial stage of diagnosis and oncological treatment during which complete or partial remission is achieved followed by a second stage during which the disease inexorably progresses toward terminal illness and death The mechanism of action of immunotherapy products such as monoclonal antibodies mAbs and therapeutic vaccines is much more selective toward tumor cells and may increase cancer patient survival with improved quality of life3–5 The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor EGFR is a wellknown oncogene Its overactivation can induce malignant transformation of a normal cell signaling inhibition of apoptosis cell proliferation angiogenesis metastasis and tumorinduced proinflammatory and immunosuppressive processes The EGFR signaling and transduction pathway can be efficiently interrupted by EGF deprivation direct specific mAb receptor inhibition or low molecular weight molecules competing intracellularly with adenosine triphospate ATP for the receptor’s tyrosine kinase activity site with negative repercussions on cell proliferation and consequently on tumor development67 Inducing EGF deprivation by active immunotherapy is an emerging concept developed by Cuban researchers which involves manipulating an individual’s immune response to release its own effector antibodies Abs against EGF thereby reducing tumor size or preventing its progression8–13 CIMAvax EGF is a therapeutic anticancer vaccine developed entirely in Cuba Its active pharmaceutical ingredients API are produced by the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology CIGB its Spanish acronym the vaccine is formulated at the Molecular Immunology Center CIM its Spanish acronym and clinical trials are conducted in hospitals meeting professional and technological Good Clinical Practice standards1415 Proof of principle POP of this novel therapy’s clinical impact was made possible by the integration of Cuban biotechnological development in the public health system and collaboration between research institutes and hospitals Since 1995 CIMAvax EGF has undergone five phase III and one phase II clinical trials Results of these investigations led the Government Center for Quality Control of Medicines CECMED its Spanish acronym the Cuban regulatory authority to license this therapeutic vaccine for use in adult patients with stage IIIBIV nonsmallcell lung cancer NSCLC Research results have also been published in various national and international scientific journals The objective of this article is to review the preclinical and clinical research conducted during development of this novel Cuban therapeutic anticancer vaccine based primarily on studies published by Cuban investigators in international peerreviewed scientific journals METHODS An automated search of the PubMed database Medline through WHO’s HINARI service was made using the key words “vaccine” and “EGF” General selection criteria were articles published by Cuban authors in peerreviewed international journals Seventeen articles published between January 1 1994 and September 30 2009 were found and reviewed for their coverage of concepts clinical data and essential technological aspects of CIMAvax EGF development and potential impact on NSCLC The main findings in each article were described and discussed along with unpublished preliminary findings of an initial ongoing phase III clinical trial RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Vaccine Formulation and Clinical Induction of Immune Response against Autologous EGF When an individual is immunized with autologous EGF from its own species no antiEGF antibody Ab response occurs To prove the feasibility of manipulating an individual’s immune response to induce an antiEGF Ab response reducing EGF concentration in blood and depriving the tumor of this growth factor8 a vaccine formulation was needed that would make EGF recognizable to the immune system that is render it immunogenic Therefore selection of an adequate immunopotentiator and adjuvant was required In 1992 preclinical studies were begun to select the most effective vaccine formulation for inducing autologous EGF immunogenicity In this stage components of the vaccine formulation were outlined and the possibility of inducing effective autologous EGF immunogenicity was demonstrated Different vaccine formulations were tried and 2 immunopotentiating proteins were selected tetanus toxoid TT and Neisseria meningitidis P64k P64k both produced in Cuba Finlay Institute and CIGB respectively Two possible adjuvants were also proposed for clinical evaluation aluminum hydroxide Superfos Denmark and Montanide ISA 51 Seppic France13–14 Clinical development of CIMAvax EGF began in 1995 with a phase III openlabel clinical trial Pilot 1 at the MedicalSurgical Research Center CIMEQ its Spanish acronym in Havana A nonrandomized design was used in 10 patients with histologically proven primary malignant tumors in different locations previously treated with firstline chemotherapy ChTVV therapeutic schedule Table 1 The main objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity of the incipient vaccine formulation15 Results of this first clinical trial constituted the earliest published scientific evidence of the feasibility of inducing an immune response against autologous EGF in patients with different advanced stage tumors Additionally protein P64k was confirmed as the optimal immunopotentiator for EGF conjugation and the CIMAvax EGF formulation Selection of NSCLC Target Location and Advanced Development of Vaccine Formulation A key factor in developing the final vaccine formulation was selection of the tumor location in which to introduce this novel therapeutic strategy NSCLC was selected because of its frequency and because EGFR is overexpressed in tissues during development and progression of lung neoplasms in the following proportions 62 of all NSCLC tumors 89 of squamous cell tumors 41 of adenocarcinomas and 80 of bronchoalveolar tumors Magnitude of EGFR expression has been reported in the literature as a predictive factor of response to biological therapy in NSCLC patients681116 The next two phase III clinical trials Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 were conducted jointly in overlapping periods 1997–1999 and 1998–2001 respectively at CIMEQ and the National Oncology and Radiobiology Institute INOR its Spanish acronym also in Havana Table 1 Pilot 2 included 20 advanced stage NSCLC IIIBIV patients 10 were randomly immunized with EGFP64k vaccine using aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant EGFP64kAL and 10 received EGFP64k adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 51 EGFP64kMontanide ISA 5117 The Pilot 3 study also included 20 advanced stage NSCLC IIIBIV patients who received the same treatments used in Pilot 2 EGFP64kAL and EGFP64kMontanide ISA 51 with a similar randomization in 2 groups except they all received a cyclophosphamide dose 200 mgm2 of body surface 72 hours before vaccine treatment onset17 Cyclophosphamide is a widely studied anticancer drug Its immunomodulating effects have significant dose and therapeutic schedulerelated repercussions1819 This pretreatment was introduced to disrupt immunologic tolerance to EGF and to induce immunogenicity toward this human molecule from the first dose17 The Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 clinical trials confirmed that vaccination induced a specific antiEGF Ab response and enabled classification of immunized patients into 2 subpopulations poor antibody responders PAR—those with poor antiEGF Ab response—and good antibody responders GAR—those with an antiEGF antibody response ≥14000 and at least 4 times 4x their preimmunization levels In both studies survival was longest in the GAR group mean 1241 months median 91 months compared to mean 547 months median 45 months in PAR patients Figure 1 The difference in survival was statistically significant P 005 Sixmonth survival was achieved by 84 of GAR and 38 of PAR Twelvemonth survival was achieved by 37 of GAR and 4 of PAR These studies also showed that patients with an antiEGF Ab response ≥60 days survived longer than those whose response lasted 60 days17 Table 1 EGF Therapeutic Anticancer Vaccine Phase III Trials Conducted in Cuba 1995–2005 Figure 1 Survival Functions for Good Antibody Responders GAR and Poor Antibody Responders PAR to EGF Vaccination in 2 Pilot Phase III Clinical Trials pooled data17 Results of the Pilot 2 and Pilot 3 phase III clinical trials confirmed greater immunogenicity with Montanide ISA 51 adjuvant EGFP64kMontanide ISA 51 in the vaccine formulation as well as the benefits of lowdose cyclophosphamide treatment 72 hours before the first immunization1720 A 4th phase III clinical trial Pilot 4 conducted at the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital HAH in Havana in 2000–2003 evaluated 2 dose levels of the therapeutic vaccine Fortythree patients with advanced stage IIIBIV NSCLC were randomized in 2 groups and received 71 µg or 142 µg of EGF Table 1 The lower dose was applied in one deltoid region and the higher dose distributed between the 2 deltoid regions21 The Pilot 4 study established a correlation between vaccine dose antiEGF Ab titers EGF serum concentrations and patient survival Survival in treated patients mean 983 months median 8 months significantly exceeded p 005 the historical control mean 62 months median 41 months while positively correlating with GAR titers ≥14000 and lower serum EGF concentrations 168 pgml This clinical trial demonstrated for the first time that EGF serum concentration levels decrease when Ab titers rise21 Return to Preclinical Research Manipulating Immunopharmacological Variables and Fine Tuning the Therapeutic Schedule The immunopharmacology of cancer vaccines is not yet fully understood and there is scant data on immunopharmacological determinants influencing therapeutic anticancer vaccines22–28 Many variables must be evaluated such as therapeutic schedules administration route dose dosing interval and optimal combination with already established therapies among others This process is even more complex when attempting to fine tune the therapy schedule of a vaccine based on a circulating selfmolecule such as autologous EGF and induce an Ab response that suppresses it from circulation thus depriving its receptor For CIMAvax EGF vaccine more efficient strategies for inducing Ab response priming were needed as well as for longterm response maintenance through reimmunization boosting25–27 Investigators therefore returned to preclinical research using murine biomodels defined as GAR BALBc mice or PAR C57BL6 mice depending on their genetic background and antibody response when challenged with the vaccine The animals were immunized with CIMAvax EGF vaccine EGFP64kMontanide ISA 51 and some immunopharmacological variables dose number of immunizations dosing interval were manipulated during both the response induction phase priming and the reinforcement or reimmunization boosting phase aimed at inducing an early robust and prolonged antiEGF Ab response potentiating its active immune deprivation29 For priming fractioning an apparently low dose 4 µg into 4 parts administered by intramuscular injection in different anatomical sites increased maximal Ab titer levels and extended the duration of vaccine response Shortening the interval between booster doses reduced persistence of antiEGF Ab titers whereas repeated boosting converted PAR status to GAR Results of this study led to the conclusion that the vaccine should be administered in a high but fractioned dose in multiple anatomical sites such as the 2 deltoid and 2 gluteal regions thereby bringing the EGF vaccine closer to regional lymph nodes and synergizing the immune response29 Return to Clinical Trials Combining Therapeutic Vaccination V and Chemotherapy ChT Tumor biology is the result of cell genome interaction with environment in addition to mutual influence this interaction has repercussions in both reconfiguration of cell metabolism and evolutionary selection of more efficient tumor mechanisms The immune system is one of the critical elements involved in shaping cell phenotype30–34 The complexity of mechanisms involved in malignant transformation of cells lends itself to a combination therapy approach aimed at among other things simultaneously controlling tumor immunoevasion and dissemination In this context immunotherapies emerge as an approach that ensures greater specificity and limited associated toxicity Immunotherapies have been included in standard cytotoxic therapeutic regimens since they were first developed Passive mAb immunotherapy in particular has confirmed the potential of these combinations35–39 In this context it was hypothesized that potentially autoreactive lymphocyte clones capable of generating an autologous antiEGF antibody response reemerge from chemotherapyinduced maximum lymphocyte depletion lymphopenia nadir amplified with homeostatic advantage4041 Based on these concepts and preclinical research results a therapeutic schedule combining vaccine chemotherapy and more vaccine VChTV was proposed This schedule was evaluated in the 5th phase III clinical trial Pilot 5 begun in 2001 in the Hermanos Ameijeiras Hospital HAH in Havana using the CIMAvax EGF EGFP64kMontanide ISA 51 formulation in 20 stage IIIBIV NSCLC patients This study corroborated the correlation between an increase in antiEGF Ab titers and a decrease in serum EGF concentration Correlation between antibody titers and EGFEGFR binding inhibition capacity was also shown and GAR patient sera immunodominance against loop B of the EGF molecule was established42 Another important finding in the Pilot 5 clinical trial was the differentiation of a new subpopulation of patients with antiEGF antibody titers ≥164000 defined as super good antibody responders sGAR A correlation between Ab response and survival was also observed sGAR patients survived significantly longer than patients classified as only GAR Figure 2 This clinical finding tends to confirm the hypothesis that potentially autoreactive clones reemerge and amplify possibly favoring active immunization with the VChTV therapeutic schedule42 Figure 2 Survival Functions of Super Good Antibody Responders sGAR Compared with Good Antibody Responders GAR to CIMAvax EGF Vaccine Pilot Phase III Clinical Trial42 These findings have led to a new line of preclinical research for evaluating the specific influence of each active immunotherapy combination with standard chemotherapy regimens defining the immunopharmacological variables considered for rational design of combined therapeutic schedules and establishing the specific impact of these combinations on T and B lymphocyte populations43 Phase II Clinical Trial Proof of Principle and Licensing for NSCLC Therapy Parallel to evaluation of the VChTV schedule a 1st phase II controlled clinical trial was initiated in December 2001 to evaluate the survival effect of CIMAvax EGF EGFP64kMontanide ISA 51 immunization in advanced stage IIIBIV NSCLC patients previously treated with firstline chemotherapy ChTVV44 This trial included 80 patients randomized 11 and was conducted in 4 Havana hospitals HAH CIMEQ INOR and the Benéfico Jurídico Hospital and 5 provincial hospitals III Congreso Hospital in Pinar del Río Celestino Hernández Hospital in Villa Clara María Curie Hospital in Camagüey Vladimir Ilich Lenin Hospital in Holguín and Saturnino Lora Hospital in Santiago de Cuba In this phase II clinical trial the safety profile observed in earlier phase III vaccine studies was confirmed No grade 3 or 4 treatmentrelated adverse events AE were detected according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 30 Table 2 EGF VaccineRelated Adverse Events by Arm Phase II Clinical Trial The most frequent AE were fever headache chills and pain at the injection site Table 2 Correlations between higher antiEGF Ab titers and lower serum EGF concentrations and between higher antiEGF Ab titers and longer patient survival were also confirmed Mean survival was 1947 months median 117 months in GAR patients n20 497 months median 36 months in PARs n18 and 852 months median 533 months in the control group n37 Longer survival was observed in all vaccinated patients compared to randomized unvaccinated controls and the difference was significant p 005 in the group aged 60 years mean1853 months median 1147 months in those vaccinated compared to mean 755 months median 533 months in controls Figure 344 Figure 3 Survival Functions for Patients Aged 60 Years Phase II Clinical Trial44 Laboratory results associated with the CIMAvax EGF mechanism of action confirmed the EGFEGFR binding inhibition capacity of vaccinated patient sera and the capacity of vaccinated patient sera to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation was established for the first time Additionally survival was better among vaccinated patients whose sera inhibited EGFR phosphorylation and was significantly better in patients whose sera preferentially recognized loop B of the EGF molecule45 This phase II clinical trial contributed to the proof of principle of the therapeutic vaccination’s clinical effect by demonstrating increased survival of CIMAvax EGFvaccinated patients compared to the control group and by demonstrating the feasibility of manipulating an individual’s immune response to release its own effector Abs against EGF as a tumor growth factor thereby reducing tumor size or preventing its progression Evidence obtained from the 5 phase III clinical trials Table 1 and the results of this phase II study led CECMED the Cuban regulatory authority to license CIMAvax EGF as a therapeutic vaccine indicated for adult advanced stage IIIBIV NSCLC patients46 Technological Development Production and Quality Control Systems Technological development of CIMAvax EGF therapeutic anticancer vaccine involved inducing autologous EGF immunogenicity by conjugating it with other molecules acting as immunopotentiators P64k selecting the most appropriate adjuvant Montanide ISA 51 and increasing the quantity with each formulation beginning with laboratory amounts used in preclinical studies and vaccination of the first patients through scaling up to supply the ongoing phase III clinical trial in Cuba and other clinical trials abroad as well as health system demand for use in treating patients The EGF used in the vaccine is a recombinant human growth factor hurEGF The P64k protein is also recombinant both are produced by CIGB as active pharmaceutical ingredients and supplied to CIM where they are chemically conjugated and the final vaccine formulation is prepared Parallel to the production process physicochemical assays have been conducted to characterize the product at different stages of development from POP to the current vaccine formulation47 Steps have been taken at each stage to guarantee comparability between different batches and different stages of development Good Manufacturing Practices GMP have been observed throughout the production and quality control process which is audited and inspected by regulatory agencies from Cuba and other countries Conducting assays to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity has been particularly difficult This type of assay is carried out in vivo Autologous human EGF is foreign to other species To overcome this challenge NMRI mice were used The genetic background of this outbred line of mice no parental mating makes it an adequate biomodel for representing the genetic variability of open human populations Due to this particularity NMRI mice only produce antiEGF Ab responses when immunized with the whole vaccine formulation EGFP64kMontanide ISA 51 and do not respond when immunized with the EGF molecule alone that is outside the vaccine formulation that makes it immunogenic47 Ongoing Phase III Clinical Trial A phase III clinical trial has been underway since June 2006 at 18 clinical research sites throughout the country The same ChTVV therapeutic schedule used in the phase II clinical trial is being used but the vaccine is being distributed in 4 injection sites This study is planned to recruit 579 advanced stage IIIBIV NSCLC patients with a 12 randomization 1 control patient for each 2 treated patients Results will be evaluated in 2 patient strata aged 60 years n 381 and aged ≤60 years n198 Preliminary results from 160 patients show numerical differences in 24month survival rates Graphic survival analysis in both strata and by protocol shows a trend towards delayed separation of the curves over time in favor of vaccinated patients compared to unvaccinated as expected in survival evaluation of patients treated with therapeutic vaccines48–50 Although statistical significance of these differences has not yet been confirmed they suggest possible benefit for patients treated with CIMAvax EGF vaccine Future Challenges Even though the survival benefit of therapeutic immunization with CIMAvax EGF in advanced stage NSCLC patients has been demonstrated this evidence was obtained in a clinical trial context with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria and specialized oncology service standards of care The next stage in CIMAvax EGF vaccine development is the transition from specialized services to primary health care To meet this objective systematizing evidence of the vaccine’s safety for chronic use needs to begin now Today’s oncology patients are the object of a therapeutic paradigm shift through which the sequential impact of immunotherapy combined with surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy tends to prolong survival with an ethically acceptable quality of life3448–50 Cancer is beginning to be approached as a 2stage disease the first stage begins with diagnosis followed by very aggressive toxic treatment in a hospital setting aimed at maximum reduction of tumor burden the second stage begins when chemotherapy potential has been exhausted progression is slow and continuous prognosis depends on tumor progression speed and the disease behaves like a chronic noncommunicable condition requiring permanent care It is in this second stage when due to their low toxicity immunotherapies could be administered chronically in a primary care setting For CIMAvax EGF meeting this challenge implies a transition from establishing proof of principle in clinical trials to making an impact on population health by prolonging survival of the approximately 4234 new NSCLC cases reported annually in Cuba and consequently reducing the number of deaths in the same period At the same time the vaccine’s effect needs to be evaluated in earlier NSCLC stages and in patients unfit for chemotherapy Predictors are needed to indicate which NSCLC patient subpopulation may or may not respond to this immunotherapy Moreover benefits of administering CIMAvax EGF in other tumor locations—such as prostate carcinoma in which EGFR has a central role in the resistance mechanisms to androgenic blocking—need to be evaluated51 References Galán Y Fernández L Torres P García M Trends in Cuba’s Cancer Incidence 1990 to 2003 and

articles in PMC Abstract The prognosis of patients with advanced non small cell lung NSCLC cancer remains dismal Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is overexpressed in many epithelial derived tumors and its role in the development and progression of NSCLC is widely documented CimaVaxEGF is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed by human recombinant Epidermal Growth Factor EGF conjugated to a carrier protein P64K from Neisseria Meningitides The vaccine is intended to induce antibodies against self EGF that would block EGFEGFR interaction CimaVaxEGF has been evaluated so far in more than 1000 advanced NSCLC patients as second line therapy Two separate studies were compared to assess the impact of high dose vaccination at multiple anatomic sites in terms of immunogenicity safety and preliminary efficacy in stage IIIbIV NSCLC patients In both clinical trials patients started vaccination 1 month after finishing first line chemotherapy Vaccination at 4 sites with 24 mg of EGF high dose was very safe The most frequent adverse events were grade 1 or 2 injection site reactions fever headache and vomiting Patients had a trend toward higher antibody response The percent of very good responders significantly augmented and there was a faster decrease of circulating EGF All vaccinated patients and those classified as good responders immunized with high dose at 4 sites had a large tendency to improved survival Introduction In spite of an intensive research effort lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death For advanced nonsmallcell lung cancer NSCLC firstline platinumbased chemotherapy has reached a plateau of effectiveness 1 For the second or third line therapy the reported response rate is usually less than 10 and the median survival time rarely exceeds the 8 months boundary 2 As a result searching for new efficacious drugs is warranted The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor is a very well validated target in NSCLC and it is overexpressed in a very high percent of tumors classified as NSCLC 3 Strategies to block this pathway include tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs and monoclonal antibodies 2 3 Erlotinib and gefitinib 2 small inhibitors are recommended as second or third line therapies after the platinum doublet 4 Moreover gefitinib has recently been approved in Europe and Japan as frontline treatment of patients bearing EGFR activating mutations 5 Cetuximab a chimeric antibody which recognizes the extracellular EGFR domain can be combined with first line cisplatinvinorelbine in those subjects with advanced or recurrent NSCLC 6 Our team is using a different approach to target EGFR consisting on a therapeutic vaccine CimaVaxEGF 7 The vaccine is composed by human recombinant Epidermal Growth Factor EGF chemically conjugated to a carrier protein from Neisseria meningitides and emulsified in Montanide ISA51 The vaccine is intended to induce antibodies against EGF one of the most important ligand of the EGFR that would block EGFEGFR binding So far 6 clinical trials have been terminated that proved that the vaccine is safe and able to induce antiEGF antibodies together with a decrease of EGF concentration in sera 8 14 However cancer vaccine optimization is a continuous process devoted to augment the specific immune response For self antigens this response should overcome the downregulation that controls the natural autoimmunity 15 So far the strategy to beat the natural tolerance to the EGF has included 4 main directions the refinement of the adjuvant and carrier 8 9 and the systematic exploration of the schedule and dose dependence 10 13 14 Previous studies have contributed to delineate CimaVaxEGF components P64k protein was chosen over Tetanus Toxoid as the carrier molecule 8 and Montanide ISA 51 resulted in a more potent adjuvant as compared to Alum 9 11 The scheduledependence of vaccination has been evaluated and several schemes as well as combinations with chemotherapy have been investigated 8 14 In the randomized Phase II trial 80 NSCLC subjects received vaccination or best supportive care Vaccination consists of 06 mg of EGF at 1 injection site In the efficacy analysis there was a trend toward survival benefit for all vaccinated patients that became significant in patients younger than 60 years The survival advantage was also significant in subjects classified as good responders anti EGF titers ≥ 1 4000 sera dilution and in those in whom the EGF concentration declined below 168 pgml 13 Based in the previous evidences from the phase II study and aiming to improve vaccine immunogenicity a phase III trial was designed with a higher antigen dose administered at multiple vaccination sites 2 deltoids gluteus This Phase III clinical trial is currently ongoing and it is primarily intended to evaluate the efficacy of CimaVaxEGF vs best supportive care in terms of survival In this manuscript we make a comparison of the impact of using high antigen dose distributed in 4 immunization sites Phase III trial vs low dose at 1 injection site Phase II trial regarding safety immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy Materials and methods Trial Design For this analysis the 40 all vaccinated patients from the phase II clinical trial immunized at a single anatomic site with the EGF vaccine 13 were compared to the first 40 vaccinated patients from a phase III clinical trial which received vaccination at multiple sites These 40 patients were evaluated as part of the first interim analysis of the Phase III trial Patients in both trials signed the informed consent and both protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating institutions Both clinical trials enrolled patients older than 18 years with histology or cytology proven NSCLC at stages IIIB and IV and all patients have had measurable disease at the moment of enrollment Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ECOG performance status PS of 2 or less adequate bone marrow reserve white blood cells WBC count of at least 3 000μL platelet count of at least 100 000 μL hemoglobin of at least 10 gdl life expectancy of at least 3 months and creatinine bilirubin and transaminase levels according to each institutional standard Apart from the Phase II trial in the currently ongoing Phase III study patients were required to show at least stable disease to first line chemotherapy On the contrary 26 of the patients entered Phase II study with a progressive disease following 4 chemotherapy cycles Pregnancy or lactation secondary malignancies or history of hypersensitivity to foreign proteins rendered patients ineligible All patients received 4 to 6 cycles of platinumbased chemotherapy before random assignment and finished firstline chemotherapy regimen at least 4 weeks before entering trial Treatment Schedule In both trials a lowdose of cyclophosphamide 200 mgm 2 was administered by the intramuscular route 3 days before the first immunization with CimaVaxEGF rEGFrp64kMontanide ISA 51 VG An induction phase of 4 quarterly immunizations and monthly reimmunizations was performed Immunized patients from the phase II clinical trial received vaccination at a single anatomic site corresponding to 06 mg of EGF in 12 mL of water in oil emulsion 13 On the other hand immunized patients from the ongoing phase III trial received vaccination at 4 sites 2 deltoids 2 gluteus equivalent to 24 mg of the antigen distributed in the 4 anatomic sites corresponding to 06 mg of EGF in 12 mL water in oil emulsion per site Patients assigned to the control arm in both protocols received best supportive care Measurements of Antibody Titers Blood samples were collected every 14 days for 60 days and monthly thereafter AntiEGF antibody titers were measured through an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA as previously described 8 AntiEGF antibody titer was defined as the inverse of the highest serum dilution with a final value of optical absorbance equal to two times blank absorbance plus 3 times the SD Response is provided as the mean of antibodies titers ± SEM Patients were classified as good antibody responders GAR if they reached antiEGF antibody titers equal or higher than 14 000 sera dilution and super good antibody responders SGAR if patients reached antiEGF antibody titers at least equivalent to 164 000 An ELISA test was used for the identification of EGF epitopes recognized by sera of immunized patients and EGF serum concentration was measured using a commercial ELISA Quantikine RD Systems Inc Minneapolis MN as previously described 10 Statistical Analysis A geometric T tests for independent samples was used to compare the antibody titers for patients vaccinated under the 2 different schemes Pearson Chi square was used to compare the demographic categorical variables as well as the percentage of good and supergood responders Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman r correlation were used to estimate the correlation between the immunologic Survival analysis was performed according to the KaplanMeier method and the log rank estimate All analyses were performed using SPSS for windows version 16 Results Two separate studies were compared to assess the impact of high dose vaccination at multiple anatomic sites in terms of immunogenicity safety and preliminary efficacy of CimaVaxEGF in advanced NSCLC patients In both clinical trials patients started vaccination 1 month after finishing first line chemotherapy In the Phase II study 40 vaccinated patients the vaccine dose was 06 mg of the antigen which was administered by the intramuscular route at 1 injection site The Phase III trial is still ongoing but for the aim of comparability we used the data from the first 40 vaccinated patients These subjects received 4 times the previous dose 24 mg of EGF that was administered by the intramuscular route at 4 anatomic sites Before any analysis patients recruited in the 2 trials were compared in terms of demographic and tumor characteristics In general vaccinated patients in both studies were well balanced regarding the most important baseline features Table ​ Table1 1 All patients had an ECOG PS of 2 or less stage IIIB was the most represented and the nonadenocarcinoma subtype was the most frequent Notably there were more patients younger than 60 years old in the phase II study low

Safety In both studies vaccination was very well tolerated No serious related adverse events were reported in any of the studies In the Phase II study 13 the most frequent adverse events consisted on grade 1 or 2 fever headache asthenia chills tremors injection site pain and vomiting On the other hand the most frequent adverse events in the Phase III were grade 1 or 2 injection site reactions fever headache vomiting chills and nausea No significant differences were detected between the 2 vaccination schemes in terms of the frequency or severity of the adverse events Immune response The humoral antiEGF response was measured as the principal surrogate marker of the immune response elicited by vaccination Patients vaccinated with low dose at 1 site at the phase II study reached an antiEGF antibody titer of 13160 sera dilution geometric mean while patients from the phase III study reached a antiEGF antibody titer of 17328 geometric mean T test p 005 In addition in both trials patients were classified as good antibody responders GAR or super good responders SGAR GAR and SGAR conditions had been repeatedly correlated with increased survival Fiftythree percent 528 of the vaccinated patients in the phase II trial were good responders and only 4 patients 108 met the SGAR condition On the contrary 564 of patients from the vaccine arm in the ongoing phase III study met the GAR criterion while 308 were classified as superresponders SGAR The percentage of SGAR was significantly higher for patients vaccinated with the high dose at multiple sites Table ​ Table2 2 Table

antibody titer was inversely correlated to the EGF serum concentration spearman r correlation p 005 However the kinetic of the EGF reduction was not the same In the low dose1 injection site trial EGF concentration reduction below a 500 pgmL took place after vaccinating patients for 10 months while in the high dosemultiple sites study the decay below the 500 pgml threshold had effect after 76 days of vaccination Figure ​ Figure1 1 Open in a separate window Figure 1 Kinetic of Anti EGF antibodies and serum EGF concentrations in the Phase III Trial Vaccination with high dose4 anatomic sites The antiEGF antibody titer was inversely correlated to the EGF serum concentration spearman r correlation p 005 in this high dosemultiple sites study the decay below the 500 pgmL threshold had effect after 76 days of vaccination As previously reported 14 46 of the patients showed a predominant response against the B loop of EGF molecule using the single site vaccination approach This response was met between months 4 and 7 after starting vaccination Noticeably at the same time points 455 of patients in the phase III trial showed the same immunodominant antibody profile For both studies the predominant subclasses were IgG3 and IgG4 Preliminary efficacy The median survival of the vaccinated patients in the phase II trial was 647 months and the survival rate at 24 months was 2727 The median survival of the first 40 subjects from the phase III trial was 1357 months and the survival rate at 24 months was 342 log rank p value 005 Patients who achieved the GAR condition within the Phase II study had a median survival of 1176 months while GAR patients in the Phase III survived for 2687 months log rank p value 005 Thirtyone percent of patients in the Phase III were classified as SGAR and had a median survival time of 299 months while only 4 subjects in the Phase II achieved this condition precluding any comparison within the SGAR cohort Discussion The clinical evaluation of the EGF cancer vaccine started 15 years ago So far more than 1000 patients had been immunized worldwide with encouraging results in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and castration resistant prostate cancer patients This vaccine is not intended to induce a cellular response but a humoral immunity against EGF a self protein The antibodies elicited by vaccination provoke an immunecastration of EGF which hampers EGFEGFR interaction Previous randomized clinical trials had identified the best carrier protein adjuvant and vaccination schedule No randomized trials had been conducted so far to assess the impact of immunizing at one vs 4 anatomic sites with low or high antigen dose Here we compared 2 separate studies that target the same population newly diagnosed IIIbIV NSCLC patients that started vaccination 1 month after completing first line chemotherapy The most important distinction between the 2 populations is the response to chemotherapy All patients had at least disease control in the Phase III while 26 of subjects in the phase II progressed after first line chemotherapy Both groups of vaccinated patients were well balanced regarding the remaining important prognostic and predictive factors for the vaccine efficacy The percent of patients younger than 60 was slightly higher in the Phase II as compared to the Phase III trial This is precisely the population that had showed the greatest benefit after using CimaVaxEGF A better result of vaccination in younger people is anticipated considering the physiologic aging of the immune system which results in the contraction of the naïve repertoire In summary vaccination at 4 sites with 24 mg of EGF was safe and patients had a trend toward higher antibody response and overall survival The percentage of good responders did not increase and the immunedominance profile was not modified However the percent of very good responders significantly augmented and there was a faster decrease of circulating EGF after vaccinating with higher dose at multiple sites Previously in mice an EGF vaccine dose resulting suboptimal when administered at a single site induced a robust immune response if fractionated in 2 or 4 limbs 16 Administering 4 times the dose at 4 anatomic sites did not increase the immune response of mice In our clinical data set we cannot determine which factor was more relevant for improving vaccine immunogenicity the amount of antigen or the spatial distribution of the antigen load The distribution of vaccine inoculation has been previously found to have a significant impact on vaccine potency 17 18 Theoretically inoculating a vaccine at multiple sites would increase the total number of precursors that are exposed to the antigen thereby increasing the number of activated specific effector cells However this concept has not been systematically evaluated in the clinical setting Conversely increasing the dose has not always been correlated with greater antigenicity Many clinical trials have evaluated the impact of dose escalation and there was found to be no direct relationship between dose and immune response 19 21 Still reduction of antigen below a minimal threshold can bring the response to a halt and in contrast persistence of the antigen may stop the immune response through the deletion of effector cells 22 As a corollary the optimal dose should be established for each vaccine in the clinical setting Even though we have preliminary evidences of improved immunogenicity and clinical benefit of the new vaccination approach the definitive information will come out after closing enrolment and followup of the patients in the ongoing Phase III trial Nonetheless we still have many pending questions can the immune response be augmented or have we reached a plateau Could we have the same effect by vaccinating with low dose at multiple sites Would we induce clonal exhaustion after repeatedly vaccinating with a high dose Which other manipulations can be done to improve immunogenicity vaccination in lymphopenia distinct prime and boosting So far a parallel trial evaluating a vaccinechemotherapyvaccine schedule is ongoing The rationale behind is to expand the immune precursors before chemotherapy to facilitate their preferential homeostatic recovery by reimmunizing after the cytotoxic regimen In summary the evidence of higher immunogenicity and clinical benefit of the new vaccination dose and method is consolidating the next step would be to confirm if all vaccinated patients had a significantly better survival as compared to controls The final result of this trial is eagerly awaited Abbreviations used in this paper ECOG Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group EGF Epidermal Growth Factor EGFR Epidermal Growth Factor

396,html Xi Jinping ARGO INITIATIVE THE INTELLIGENCE LEDGERS Home About Database The Intelligence Ledger More Nicholas Doumouras Jr Jan 12 10 min read Xi Jinping Xi Jinping is the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China CPC and President of the People’s Republic of China PRC As one of only three individuals to have their name enshrined in the PRC’s constitution Xi s arguably the most influential leader of China in decades Life Early Life General Secretary Jinping was born in 1953 to affluent and respected parents Xi Zhongxun his father was one of the Chinese Communist Partys founding members a vicepremier and close friend of Chairman Mao Zedong Despite having held high positions and maintaining close working relationships with powerful officials Zhongxun fell out of favor with Mao and was sent to work in a general stores factory in Henan In 1966 Xi Jinping’s education was cut short when universities across the nation were forced to shutter during the Cultural Revolution Soon thereafter the Xi family was targeted as an enemy of the people for their fathers supposed crimes In 1967 a student militia raided the Xi home causing irreparable in damage and destroying family heirlooms Less than a month later Xi Jinping’s sister Xi Heping committed suicide after being pressured and bullied by party enforcers Throughout all this Xi and his mother were forced by local cadre to publicly denounce Xi Zhongxun as a traitor to the state and enemy of China In 1969 Xi Jinping was sent to China’s desolate province of Shaanxi to work as a manual laborer While there he was assigned to work as the town’s party secretary Within three months Xi grew disillusioned with the position and snuck back into Beijing Although he was able to enjoy his freedom for a short period of time he was arrested during a state crackdown on hardlabor deserters As punishment for his dereliction of duty he was sent to a work camp to dig irrigation ditches the location of which is unknown Rise to Power In 1971 the future leader of China was presented with an opportunity to escape his dire situation After befriending a local strongman Xi joined the local chapter of the Community Youth League of China CYL Similar to Boy Scouts in the United States of America the CYLs mission was to prepare the PRC’s next generation of leaders Managed by the Communist Party of China several of Chinas top officials would emerge from CYL program In 1972 more fortune befell the young man when he was reunited with his father at the behest of Premier Zhou Enlai With normalcy somewhat restored Xi entered Tsinghua University in Beijing to study chemical engineering In 1974 Xi became a member of the Communist Party of China He received his first posting in 1974 as a branch secretary but was forced to put his advancement on hold while attending university for chemical engineering After his graduation in 1979 Xi became a secretary for Vice Premier Geng Viao the secretarygeneral of the all powerful Central Military Commission CMC This transformative experience not only taught Xi about the People’s Liberation Army and its rampant technological modernization and mobilization issues but about the intricacies of operating within the Communist Party itself Following the normalization of relations between the United States and the People’s Republic in 1979 Xi traveled to the United States as part of a Chinese delegation to study mass agriculture strategies While on the trip Xi had the opportunity to stay in the home of an American family in Muscatine Iowa Although discussion between the two sides were difficult Xi and the family had to speak through a translator the experience reportedly left a lasting impression of the United States on Xi Always seeking to advance his reputation and prestige within the party Xi shrewdly resigned from CMC duty in 1982 Instead of remaining in Beijing he requested a deputy secretary position in the province of Hebei Although the province has many megacities Hebei is also known for its jagged terrain and unforgiving weather By vying for a more difficult position outside of Beijing instead of a comfortable party job Xi garnered much praise and admiration from high party officials Mr Jinping would remain in this post until 1985 when he become the vice mayor of Xiamen Fujian While on assignment in Xiamen Xi met Peng Liyuan a wellknown and respected Chinese folksinger After being introduced by friends their relationship slowly developed into a romantic one In 1987 after obtaining the required parental consent they married Following the marriage Xi’s good fortunes continued By 1995 he had worked his way to the post of deputy provincial party secretary and by 1999 the governorship of Fujian From his tenure in Fujian we begin to see Xi’s policy objectives Top on his agenda was expanding trade with Taiwan which lay just across the straight Another topic commonly dealt with by the young governor was environmental conservation and the growing pollution situation as a result of economic advancement He held the governorship of Fujian until 2002 when he became the governor and party secretary of Zhejiang The same year he became a full member of the 16th Central Committee and thus a national figure albeit a minor one While in Zhejiang Xi attempted to take on rampant corruption that crippled the local administration ability to govern He also sought to improve infrastructure for the local population and promote industrial development It remains unclear how effective these attempts were In 2007 the CPC turned to Mr Jinping for a helping hand Shanghai’s party secretary had been dipping his hand into the local population’s pension fund and proved quite sloppy in covering his tracks Xi was quickly transferred to the city and given the party secretary position for seven months In this highly public and envied position he effectively rooted out corruption while simultaneously following the party line In late 2007 Xi was rewarded for his loyalty to the party with a position on the highly respected Politburo Standing Committee PSC the most powerful decision making body in the CPC This position not only fermented Mr Jinping’s position within the party but also within China He was now on a very short list of likely successors to be General Secretary and also had the ability to influence highlevel policy discussions Within a year Jinpings status was further elevated when he became the Vice President of China While in the position Xi took a special interest in developing trade relationships with foreign states and on improving pollution levels within the People’s Republic In 2010 Xi went full circle and was named the Vice Chairmen of the Central Military Commission CMC Less than two years later in November 2012 Xi Jinping would become the most powerful man in China At the Communist Partys 18th Congress Xi became the General Secretary and Chairman of the CMC thus wielding all political and military power inside the PRC In March of 2013 Xi became the leader of the state after being elected President of China by the National People’s Congress Policies Upon taking the seat of power Xi Jinping sought to transform the PRCs strategic policy objectives both at home and abroad Specifically his concerns were focused around corruption economic growth military readiness and internal order Corruption Mr Jinping’s main objective at the start of his tenure was the professionalization of the Chinese Communist Party and state government This was made manifest in the form of a major anticorruption crackdown in the months following his inauguration This campaign quickly made Xi powerful enemies including former members of the Central Military Commission Politburo Standing Committee and state security agencies However Xi persisted Within the first two years of the campaign alone nearly 200000 lowranking officials of the CCP received warnings fines and demotions An unknown amount of individuals have seen their lives upended by dismissals or forced resignations The anticorruption campaign has also been used to rid the General Secretary of political rivals Some analysts and exiles have claimed that it is simply a political purge on a scale not seen since the Cultural Revolution with enforcers believing themselves above the law and unafraid to target innocent individuals Economy Since 1979 the Peoples Republic of China has enjoyed unprecedented levels of economic growth For the past 40 years Chinas real gross domestic product GDP has grown at an annual rate of nearly 10 Xi did not start this trend but he certainly helped it along By increasing the status of the renminbi RMB developing trade partnerships though the Belt and Road Initiative and making it easier for banks to issue loans Xi has developed Chinas middle class and industrial sector into a force to be reckoned with The COVID19 pandemic however may change that trend Official government numbers from April of 2020 broadcast a nearly 68 decline in GDP for the first quarter of the year the first ever contraction since China started reporting quarterly GDP data in 1992 Of course a deep contraction isnt surprising given the massive quarantine and lockdown implemented to contain the deadly virus More concerning for the Chinese Communist Party however is the rate at which countries are shifting their supply chains out of China ​ On April 8 2020 the Intelligence Ledger reported that the Japanese government was seeking to move its manufactures supply chains out of the Peoples Republic It allocated nearly 22 billion of the governments economic stimulus package to help firms move production out of China to Japan and 235 trillion yen is intended to help those relocating to stronger allies of Japan Such moves are being considered by countries as diverse as the United States United Kingdom Australia Germany and France Sensing this growing chill Xi has sought to flex Chinese economic muscle in order to force these states into remaining trading partners namely Australia He has also called for the PRC to develop a greater selfreliance on domestic goods and services Internal Order The PRC controls territory roughly equivalent in size to that of the United States of America Yet with nearly 13 billion people its population is over four times as large Sixty percent of the population lives in only 24 of the country and most of those live on China’s expansive coast The other 74 of China is populated by what the Chinese government calls “national minorities” The national minorities are composed of Tibetans and Kazakhs with Uyghurs and other muslim groups in the relatively rebellious region of Xinjiang These minorities have strained relations with the government in Beijing and have close ties with groups in other countries or unofficial relations with other states ​China views the preservation of order in Tibet and Xinjiang as vital to its national security Xinjiang is home to Uyghuri separatists who have engaged in acts of protest both peaceful and violent to promote independence In Tibet most of the population is loyal to the Dalai Lama a monk who is in exile and believes in an autonomous state He has been charged by the PRC with promoting Tibetan independence and thus has been labeled a traitor​ Most recently the mass protests in Hong Kong have proven extremely disconcerting to the government in Beijing The uprisings against the central government began in June 2019 when activists called attention to the central governments increasing interference in city affairs They continued throughout the year evolving into a movement pushing for democratic reforms within Hong Kong itself and throughout greater China Xi Jinping has squashed these movements with great efficiency In May of 2014 the world watched in silence as Beijing used threats of terrorism as a pretext to mercilessly crackdown on members of minority communities in Xinjiang It is believed that as many as 900000 Uyghurs ethnic Kazakhs and other minorities have been sent to reeducation camps since the start of the de facto antiminority campaign In reality these are not places of learning Inmates are forced by the CCP and the government of the PRC to undergo relentless political indoctrination endless torture and repeated periods of food deprivation Furthermore and perhaps most hurtful to these minorities is the denial of religious and cultural freedom Deaths of the infirm elderly and outspoken are commonly reported although the exact number of those killed remains unknown In Hong Kong Xi has also shown a blatant disregard for international agreements A British Colony and Dependent Territory of the United Kingdom until 1997 the city was handed back over to Beijing after London obtained guarantees that the citys freedoms system and laws would be protected until the year 2047 It is clear however that Mr Jinping has not honored the terms of the pact Since entering power reports of judicial tampering have grown and Chinese intelligence operations more common Recently Xi supported the passage of a national security law that would erode Hong Kongs autonomy and bring the city under its control during the annual meeting of the National Peoples Congress NPC The exact structure of the statue has been shrouded in secrecy by Chinese officials In fact the only public statement made by the Chinese government in regards to the legislation was by Stanley Ng head of the NPC who declared the law outlaws secession attempts to subvert state power foreign interference in city affairs and terrorism In the view of the CCP and Chinese government tighter control over Hong Kong is necessary to preserve domestic order and to protect the state from hostile external forces While details regarding the new law are hard to come by one can begin to piece together what it may look like from previous attempts by Beijing to curb opposition in the city Censorship of the press searches without warrants and the destruction of the citys free and independent judiciary are undoubtedly included Furthermore Chinese law requires any company operating within China must do their most to help the security state In 2014 China instituted the CounterEspionage Law which states when the state security organ investigates and understands the situation of espionage and collects relevant evidence the relevant organizations and individuals shall provide it truthfully and may not refuse The 2017 National Intelligence Law went further requiring any organization or citizen shall support assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work in accordance with the law Such forced cooperation would quickly erode the citys preeminent position as the home for western businesses in China Most importantly the law empowers Beijing to legally bring the hammer down on Hong Kongs protestors who have been directly challenging the CCPs leadership Xi Jinping has also sought to use censorship in his quest to ensure internal order In July of 2012 the CCP released Document No 9 The internal memo warns of seven dangerous values constitutional democracy promarket neoliberalism independent media individual rights universal values historical nihilism and criticism of socialism The release or publication of information that deals with these topics is banned in stores social media television and radio Military Since taking power in 2012 Xi has overseen a massive modernization and reorganization of the Peoples Liberation Army For more information click here Conclusion Although Xi Jinping was born in Beijing in 1953 to affluent parents he did not have an easy life His father was Xi Zhongxun one of the Chinese Communist Partys founding members a vicepremier and close friend of ​Chairman Mao In 1962 however his family was among the victims impacted by the Cultural Revolution Xis father was imprisoned for crimes against the state while the nine year old boy was sent to the countryside for reeducation ​ This did not turn Mr Xi against the CPC Instead he worked his way to the top of the organization Today he is President of the Peoples Republic of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China He is one of only three individuals to have their name enshrined in the PRCs constitution and is arguably the most influential leader of the state in decades So is he simply a man who made the best of a bad situation or an evil that must be stopped The Intelligence Ledger will leave that for you

Hunter Biden finally admits laptop at center of Post exposé could ‘absolutely’ belong to him Trump hints at White House run in 2024 Hunter Biden says he let a homeless crack dealer move in with him How Hunter Biden’s wife found out about his affair with sisterinlaw For at least seven years many when his father was vice president Hunter Biden pursued a lucrative deal to run an investment firm founded by millions of dollars from a Chinese partnership Joe Biden claims he never spoke with Hunter about his dealings and never profited from any group his family set up but emails and text messages found on Hunter Biden’s old laptop hard drive — first published by The Post — show “the big guy” being referenced repeatedly A federal investigation into Hunter is ongoing and Republicans vow to continue to probe how Hunter profited off his father’s name and what Presidentelect Biden knew about it “I’m not going to turn a blind eye on this” Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson RWisc said last week “We’ll keep digging” Based on information from the laptop and interviews here’s what we know about the Chinese deal June 2009 As the ObamaBiden administration hit the halfway point of its inaugural year Hunter Biden cofounded Rosemont Seneca Partners an investment fund along with Christopher Heinz — the stepson of Obama’s future Secretary of State John Kerry — and Devon Archer a former Kerry adviser April 79 2010 Hunter Biden visited China as a Rosemont Seneca rep during the second year of his father’s vice presidency There he gained audiences with top officials of influential statelinked enterprises including the Postal Savings Bank China Investment Corp and Founder Group He was joined on the trip by James Bulger the politically connected cofounder of the Thornton Group an Asiaoriented financial services firm 2012 As Joe Biden ran for his second term as vice president Hunter Biden and Devon Archer made contact with Chinese financier Jonathan Li who ran the privateequity fund Bohai Capital The trio discussed a plan to become partners in a new operation that would invest Chinese cash in ventures outside the country Eighty percent of the resulting company Bohai Harvest was controlled by Chinese stateowned interests December 2013 When Chinese president Xi Jinping alarmed the rest of Asia with an aggressive expansion of his military claims over the East China Sea Vice President Biden was dispatched to Beijing to try to deescalate tensions The second son tagged along on Air Force Two While a somber and subdued Joe Biden held a marathon fivehour meeting with Xi Hunter got together with Jonathan Li in what handlers at the time described as a social visit The son even arranged for a handshake between Li and his father at the hotel of the American delegation — troubling some of the vice president’s advisors according to the New Yorker Ten days later the Chinese business license for Bohai Harvest — the company that Hunter Biden and Devon Archer had been trying to launch for more than a year — was approved Ye Jianming 2015 Around this time Hunter Biden’s relationship to Chinese tycoon Ye Jianming “began to ramp up” according to a Senate report released in September Ye the founder of Chinese energy giant CEFC served as the nation’s unofficial energy liaison to Russia Feb 23 and March 1 2017 A month after Biden left office a total of 6 million in wire transfers were made from State Energy HK Ltd a company controlled by Ye to Robinson Walker LLC That company was controlled by Rob Walker a longtime business partner of Hunter’s who had collaborated with him in at least three other companies Walker served in both Bill Clinton’s and George W Bush’s administrations — and his wife Betsy Massey Walker is reportedly a former member of future First Lady’s Jill Biden’s personal staff The Senate’s joint Finance Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee report said it was “unclear what the true purpose is behind these transactions and who the ultimate beneficiary is” May 23 2017 Venture capitalist Tony Bobulinski was recruited by the Bidens around this time to serve as CEO of Sinohawk Holdings which he describes as a partnership between Ye’s CEFC and the Biden family Bobulinski met twice with Joe Biden at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills where the former veep was set to give a speech Hunter Bobulinski told The Post “brings Joe over and introduces me saying Joe’s the one who’s helping us with the business we’re doing with the Chinese” Biden responded “I trust you Good luck and work hard” — and added a second instruction the next morning “Keep an eye on my son and brother Jim Biden and look out for my family” Joe Biden has repeatedly denied any knowledge of his son’s business operation In September 2020 he told reporters emphatically “I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings” Tony Bobulinski REUTERSTom Brenner May 11 2017 James Gilliar another Hunter Biden business associate talked with Bobulinski about how to “get Joe involved” in a joint venture with CEFC The two discussed ways to make the effort look like a “truly family business” in a series of text messages seen by The Post “Let’s get the company set up then tell H and family the high stakes and get Joe involved” Gilliar wrote The texts were contained in a tranche of emails and documents released by Bobulinski May 13 2017 Gilliar emailed Hunter Biden to outline remuneration packages for Hunter and five other people in an unspecified business venture The email — found on the Hunter Biden laptop and exposed in a bombshell report by The Post — suggested equity shares were being assigned to Biden family members with a note indicating that 10 would be held by Hunter “for the big guy” — who Bobulinski later definitively identified as Joe Biden Three days later Bobulinski says the plans changed Joe Biden’s 10 share would be held in the name of his brother Jim instead Bobulinski voiced his doubts about the wisdom of Joe Biden’s involvement to Jim Biden in light of his brother’s political stature “I remember saying ‘How are you guys getting away with this Aren’t you concerned’” Bobulinski said in an interview with The Post’s Michael Goodwin “‘Plausible deniability” Jim Biden responded with a chuckle Bobulinski recalled May 20 2017 “Don’t mention Joe being involved it’s only when u are face to face I know u know that but they are paranoid” Gilliar instructed Bobulinksi in an encrypted WhatsApp message thread In response Bobulinksi wrote “OK they should be paranoid about things” Later Bobulinski added what seemed to be a warning about Joe Biden’s future political plans “You need to stress to H does he want to be the reason or factor that blows up his dad’s campaign” The former veep was still two years away from announcing his third White House bid June 18 2017 Hunter Biden made an urgent request to Ye Jianming to wire him 10 million as seed money for a new venture SinoHawk Holdings according to an email obtained by The Post In the missive he said he was extending “best wishes from the entire Biden family” and that “We are all hoping to see you here again soon or in Shanghai” The diamond sent to Hunter Biden by Ye Jianming Summer 2017 Hunter met with Ye in Miami to solicit donations for World Food Program USA according to the Senate report Over dinner they discussed details of helping the Chinese magnate find investments for CEFC in the United States Afterward Ye sent him a 28carat diamond as a thankyou gift “I just felt like it was weird” Hunter later told The New Yorker — but he accepted the gem The rock later become a bone of contention in divorce proceedings between Hunter Biden and first wife Kathleen Buhle Aug 1 2017 A handdrawn flow chart included in the Senate report shows an ownership breakdown of an entity called “Hudson West” with a 5050 split between Biden and someone identified only as “chairman” An email sent the next day strongly suggests the “chairman” in question was Ye Jianming — and notes that while Hunter was to have earned 10 million a year “for introductions alone” those earlier terms had been changed “TO A MUCH MORE LASTING AND LUCRATIVE ARRANGEMENT” Aug 8 2017 Ye’s CEFC wired 5 million to Hudson West That same day the company began a yearlong series of payments to Owasco Hunter Biden’s law firm that would total 479 million the Senate report found Owasco subsequently sent 14 million — parceled out in 20 different wire transfers — to the Lion Hall Group a consulting firm controlled by James Biden and his wife Sara Biden Sept 21 2017 Hunter Biden emailed the Washington office building House of Sweden to request a set of keys for Rosemont Seneca offices be produced for Joe Biden Jill Biden Jim Biden and Gongwen Dong — all of whom were described as “office mates” according to another email Hunter Biden also noted that Gongwen Dong was an “emissary” for CEFC and Ye The House of Sweden building Alamy Stock Photo September 2017 Chi Ping Patrick Ho a Ye lieutenant agreed to pay Hunter Biden a 1 million retainer for “Counsel to matters related to US law and advice pertaining to the hiring and legal analysis of any US Law Firm or Lawyer” according to an attorney engagement letter obtained by The Post December 2018 A Manhattan federal jury convicted Ho for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by trying to bribe government officials in Africa He was sentenced to three years in prison 2018 The Department of Justice opens a probe into Hunter Biden’s tax affairs business ties in China and the Ukraine and documents covering his involvement in more than two dozen entities according to a Dec 13 2020 report by the Associated Press At least one 2017

Vaccinated Vaccine Rollout Advertisement Continue reading the main story Supported by Continue reading the main story 12 Billion From US to Drugmaker to Pursue Coronavirus Vaccine The Trump administration announced a grant to AstraZeneca which has licensed a potential vaccine that is in trials by Oxford University Scientists at Oxford University are proceeding on an accelerated timetable for a potential coronavirus vaccine in Britain in partnership with AstraZeneca Credit Sean Elias via Reuters By David D Kirkpatrick Published May 21 2020 Updated Nov 25 2020 Expanding its pursuit of an inoculation against the coronavirus the US Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday it would provide “up to 12 billion” to the drug company AstraZeneca to develop a potential vaccine from a laboratory at Oxford University The deal with AstraZeneca is the fourth and by far the largest vaccine research agreement that the department has disclosed The money will pay for a Phase 3 clinical trial of a potential vaccine in the United States this summer with about 30000 volunteers The HHS statement said the agency and AstraZeneca “are collaborating to make available at least 300 million doses” and projected that the first doses could be available as early as October That is a very accelerated ambitious timetable Most public health experts and scientists caution that a viable massproduced vaccine would probably not be available until sometime next year at the earliest Plus billions of doses would be needed around the world There is no proven treatment or vaccine against the virus and infectiousdisease experts also warn that many vaccine candidates take years to perfect Some fail or cause such severe side effects that human trials are halted Different Approaches to a Coronavirus Vaccine Scientists are using many techniques to develop coronavirus vaccines But even before any are approved governments and other organizations like the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation are spending millions of dollars to prepare for the manufacturing of several potential vaccines to make them broadly available as soon as possible In a separate statement AstraZeneca said it had reached agreements with several governments and other organizations to produce at least 400 million doses had “secured manufacturing capacity for one billion doses” and will begin its first deliveries in September AstraZeneca said it was also discussing deals for simultaneous production by other companies including the giant Serum Institute of India a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at HHS is distributing billions of dollars to companies to develop vaccines including the latest funding to AstraZeneca The authority known as Barda has already agreed to provide up to 483 million to the biotech company Moderna and 500 million to Johnson Johnson for their separate vaccine efforts It has also agreed to provide 30 million to a coronavirus vaccine effort by the French company Sanofi building on a larger contract announced last December for making flu inoculations The Coronavirus Outbreak › Latest Updates Updated April 1 2021 1102 pm ET The FDA authorizes fuller vials from Moderna a boost to vaccine stock A decline in testing may be masking the spread of the virus in some US states Word that a vaccine works well in adolescents raises hopes for normal schooling in the fall Scores of vaccine efforts are underway around the world and several potential vaccines are now in at least smallscale clinical trials But the Oxford vaccine candidate now licensed by AstraZeneca has moved quickly into the kind of largescale testing necessary to prove safety and effectiveness Follow our Live Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker Building on efforts to develop a vaccine against a similar disease the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome the Oxford scientists last month began a Phase I trial of their potential vaccine against Covid19 in Britain involving 1100 participants A combined Phase II and Phase III trial involving 5000 participants is set to begin in Britain by the end of this month The researchers have said that if the vaccine is proven effective they hope to have an approval for emergency use worldwide by September But a steep decline in the rate of new infections in Britain may make it difficult to prove effectiveness Ethics rules generally preclude deliberately infecting test participants That means unless enough test participants who are given a placebo become infected with the virus in the community the researchers cannot show that the potential vaccine does its job The largescale tests in the United States this summer may provide another opportunity On Monday Moderna announced partial data of its firstphase trial saying its vaccine candidate had proven safe and that it had provoked an immune response in 45 people including eight who had extensive tests that found they had produced antibodies that could prevent the virus from infecting cells It is also working on an accelerated timetable with partners at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Swiss company Lonza Moderna received approval to move to a second phase involving 600 people and said it would also begin a third stage in July with thousands of healthy people The Trump administration’s efforts to stanch the pandemic have been troubled by a series of agency fumbles starting with defective CDC tests that stalled detection of the virus’s spread for weeks and limited diagnoses for patients at hospitals and clinics Recently President Trump reorganized vaccine and treatment efforts after he dismissed last month the head of Barda Rick Bright who then filed a whistleblower complaint contending he had been pressured to seek approval for certain treatments for Covid19 Just last week Mr Trump named Moncef Slaoui a venture capitalist who was a longtime vaccine executive at GlaxoSmithKline and most recently a board member for Moderna to help oversee “Operation Warp Speed” the federal drive to accelerate ways to combat the virus As lead scientist of the effort Dr Slaoui’s myriad financial and drug company ties have come under scrutiny from watchdog groups He is working as a contract employee and therefore exempt from conflictofinterest and disclosure rules that pertain to many executive and federal employees He did sell his stock in Moderna and donated some of his gains to cancer research he said in an interview this week On Thursday as Mr Trump traveled to Michigan he was asked about the 1 billion grant to AstraZeneca While saying he was encouraged by recent vaccine developments he also suggested — as he had earlier — that there would be “big big announcements” within the next few weeks or so about treatment or therapeutic developments But he offered no specifics Advertisement Continue reading the main

predates the movement of Eurasian farmers back to Africa Ewen Callaway 08 October 2015 Article tools Rights Permissions Kathryn and John Arthur Modern humans emerged in Africa around 200000 years ago Update 29 January 2016 Three months after this report was published its authors announced that an avoidable software error had led to a mistake in their analysis The ancient backmigration of Eurasians into Africa was limited to eastern Africa they explained and did not cover the entirety of the continent For more see Report that much of Africa has Eurasian ancestry is mistaken A 4500yearold skeleton from a cave in Ethiopia has produced Africaâs first ancient human genome The manâs DNA suggests that Middle Eastern farmers migrated into Africa several thousand years ago leaving traces of their Eurasian ancestry in the genomes of many modernday Africans Modern humans Homo sapiens emerged in Africa around 200000 years ago before populating nearly every corner of the planet Proof of these travels is written in the genomes of people living today DNA gleaned from ancient remains found in Europe Asia and the Americas in recent years has added new twists to the human evolutionary story Yet Africa has missed out on this DNAbased revolution in part because genetic material degrades quickly in the hot temperatures of the continent Ethiopian discovery Kathryn and John Arthur This rocky area in Mota cave held bones that yielded the first ancient African genome In 2011 archaeologists working with Gamo tribesman in the highlands of southwest Ethiopia discovered Mota Cave 14 metres wide and 9 metres high overlooking a nearby river A year later they excavated a burial of an adult male his body extended and hands folded below his chin Radiocarbon dating suggested that the man died around 4500 years ago â before the proposed time of the Eurasian migrations and the advent of agriculture in eastern Africa Advances in ancient DNA technology allow researchers to reap DNA from ever older bones and the cool constantÂ temperatures of caves are kind to the molecule So a team coled by Ron Pinhasi an archaeologist at University College Dublin tested the Mota mans bones for intact DNA and found enough to sequence his genome 12 times over 1 The mans genome is unsurprisingly more closely related to presentday Ethiopian highlanders known as the Ari than to any other population the team examined suggesting a clear line of descent for the Ari from ancient human populations living in the area But further genetic studies show that the Ari also descend from people that lived outside Africa which chimes with a previous study that discovered a âbackflowâ of humans into Africa from Eurasia around 3000 years ago Humans first migrated from Africa some 60000 to 100000 years ago Eyal BartovAlamy The man found in Mota cave is related to the Ari modernday Ethiopian highlanders Eurasian influences Using genetic evidence from Eurasian ancient genomes and presentday populations the researchers determined that the migrant ancestors of the Ari were closely related to early farmers who moved into Europe from the Near East around 9000 years ago Coauthor Marcos Gallego Llorente an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Cambridge UK suggests that Middle Eastern farmers later moved south to Africa bringing new crops to the continent such as wheat barley and lentils The team also found vestiges of these migrantsâ DNA in people all across subSaharan Africa â probably carried by later migrations such as the expansion of Bantuspeaking groups from West Africa to other parts of the continent around 1000 years ago Carles LaLuezaFox a palaeogeneticist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona Spain says that the first ancient genome from Africa is an important milestone Despite the challenges to DNA preservation he expects many more to appear âAfrica is going to be a difficult place for having ancient genomes â especially high quality genomesâ LaLuezaFox says Eske Willerslev an evolutionary geneticist at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen says that his team has also had success obtaining DNA from African remains including some not protected by the cool confines of a highaltitude cave For ancient DNA research Africa is the next step in terms of the population history of humans It is an obvious place to go and look he says Journal name Nature DOI doi 101038nature201518531 Tweet Follow NatureNews Follow EwenCallaway References Gallego Llorente M et al Science
