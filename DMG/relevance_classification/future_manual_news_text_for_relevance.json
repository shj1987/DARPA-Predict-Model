If Bajwa didn\u2019t escalate after India\u2019s revocation of Article 370, he won\u2019t do so now.\n\nAyesha Siddiqa\n\n4 July, 2020 9:29 am IST\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedin\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nFile photo | Pakistan PM Imran Khan with Gen Qamar Bajwa | @peaceforchange | Twitter\n\nText Size:\n\nA-\n\nA+\n\nA\n\ns India tries to sort out its tension with\u00a0China, Pakistan\u2019s relative silence is noticeable.\u00a0Although intently watching the\u00a0India-China\u00a0conflict, Islamabad\u2019s contribution has not extended beyond the ceasefire violations to some significant\u00a0ratcheting up the temperature at the\u00a0Line of Control.\u00a0If anything, there is the\n\nconcern\n\nthat\u00a0New\u00a0Delhi may initiate some form of\u00a0fighting\u00a0to assuage any domestic concerns regarding\u00a0the Narendra\u00a0Modi government\u2019s inability to strongly stand up to China. While responding to Beijing in Ladakh or other places where China has critical interests may take longer for India, the\u00a0domestic\u00a0embarrassment could be minimised by increasing temperature with Pakistan. The idea of India starting a limited conflict with Pakistan instead is presented in two articles published within a week of each other from sources that have the ears of the military establishment. This in itself indicates how the military either sees the situation or would like the people to understand it.\n\nMany in\u00a0the Indian\n\nmedia\n\nsay\u00a0that some grand conspiracy is afoot between China and Pakistan in which the latter has amassed about 20,000 troops in Gilgit-Baltistan and is frantically consulting with Chinese generals. Besides some\u00a0in the Indian\u00a0media, such a story is close to the heart of\u00a0Pakistan\u2019s\u00a0retired Lt General Asad Durrani.\n\nIn a\u00a0recent\n\narticle\n\n, the former\u00a0Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)\u00a0chief talked about a combined\u00a0China-Pakistan effort against India with the hope to solve the Kashmir issue. However, the article expressed a wish that the two countries\u00a0should have\u00a0collaborated before the launch of the crisis in Ladakh. But the fact of the matter is that there is no indication of any extraordinary movement by Pakistan at the\u00a0Line of Control (LoC)\u00a0or the northern areas. Of course, there are troops in\u00a0Gilgit-Baltistan\u00a0in anticipation of any possible tension and to organise elections next month in August, in which the army will play its role of ensuring its favourite candidate wins, but not the kind of numbers that intelligence reports published in the Indian media present.\u00a0In fact, given the tension in the area,\u00a0it would be odd for Pakistan not to ramp up its security, but an aggressive intent is not visible.\n\nAlso read:\n\nPM Modi sends message to China from Ladakh: \u2018Age of expansionism is over\u2019\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for Pakistan\n\nSurely, there is a general excitement\u00a0in Pakistan\u00a0on the demonstration of\u00a0the\u00a0Modi government\u2019s relative weakness vis-\u00e0-vis China.\u00a0From the late\u00a01990s,\u00a0when Beijing-New\u00a0Delhi relations had picked up to a degree that it had become a matter of concern for Islamabad, bilateral relations between Pakistan\u2019s two big neighbours have nose-dived in an unprecedented manner. I remember my conversations with some Pakistani diplomats in 1998-99, who were worried about China no longer wanting to play a zero-sum game\u00a0in South Asia.\n\nBeijing had remained neutral even during Kargil when it encouraged Islamabad to withdraw its troops. When I spoke with him a few years ago, then air force chief, Air Marshal\u00a0Pervaiz Mehdi Qureshi, talked about his visit to Beijing\n\nwith the official delegation headed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with the expectation that the\u00a0People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA)\u00a0Air Force will\u00a0lend material help\u00a0as it did during the 1960s. However,\u00a0he\u00a0returned disappointed\u00a0when\u00a0the PLA Air Force chief told\u00a0Qureshi\u00a0that he was ready to help if the Chinese political leadership agreed to it.\n\nUnless China and India find a way around their mutual anxieties about each other\u2019s intent, a new strategic scene has been set after Ladakh from which it is difficult for both to get out while keeping semblance of their respective strength.\u00a0For Pakistan, this conflict is a strategic balancer that has greater potential of keeping\u00a0New\u00a0Delhi engaged, especially if India and China are tempted away from finding a solution to their ongoing tension towards a \u2018Siachinisation\u2019 of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Asserting power and indicating intent to protect territories where \u2018even grass doesn\u2019t grow\u2019 by both China and India (or as in the case of Pakistan and India in Siachen) is likely to escalate operational military expenditure and human cost on both sides. This is a battle that Rawalpindi would let China fight itself, and\u00a0in which it may keep adding to the temperature\u00a0in relatively small proportions.\n\nAlso read:\n\nIndia can\u2019t afford to be defensive against China like it has been with Pakistan on terror\n\nBigger battles in Pakistan\n\nSurprisingly, there seems to be a dearth of analysis on the ongoing\u00a0India-China\u00a0conflict. Barring some carefully expressed\n\nviews\n\n, there is nothing much\u00a0to go on. This is probably due to the shrinking of the strategic community. Despite the military\u2019s interest in promoting and building a security studies community, a debate is missing because the general curbing of alternative\u00a0voices has\u00a0reduced the organic nature of the conversation. However, the relative silence can be equally attributed to analysts being overly engaged with\u00a0Pakistan\u2019s\u00a0domestic political crisis.\n\nSome of the sources I spoke with were of the view that even the military\u2019s attention is diverted to the bigger question of how to deal with the economic and general political crisis generated by\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Imran Khan\u00a0and his ministers. The damage that the government and its aviation minister single-handedly brought to the country\u2019s aviation industry is a real crisis that has not only resulted in the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)\n\nblocking\n\nPakistan\u2019s national carrier from flying to Europe but will\u00a0also\u00a0have long-term repercussions for the country. Clearly, the hybrid-military/democratic model is failing and Army Chief Qamar\u00a0Javed\u00a0Bajwa and his cabal\u00a0are\u00a0unable to find a quick and credible replacement for Imran Khan. Even if an internal change within the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\u00a0(PTI) is brought, it will be short-term with little likelihood of eradicating issues of governance.\n\nAlso read:\n\nIndia keeps tight watch on Pakistan as ceasefire violations rise at LoC amid China standoff\n\nIslamabad is no Kathmandu\n\nThe military\u2019s political engagement at a time when temperature in the region is boiling is also a reminder of the Siachen crisis in the mid-1980s. While both India and Pakistan were busy shopping for high-altitude warfare gear and equipment,\u00a0New\u00a0Delhi overtook Pakistan in occupying the glacier as Rawalpindi was too busy\u00a0with\u00a0domestic politics. A similar situation prevails now, especially if the concern regarding\u00a0possible Indian aggression is real. Given the concentration of forces in Ladakh, Pakistan\u2019s main concern is\u00a0about\u00a0the security of Skardu in Gilgit-Baltistan, an area\u00a0that may be on India\u2019s focus, especially after the revocation of Article 370.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Pakistan\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0defend itself since,\u00a0for Islamabad,\u00a0the takeaway from Pulwama-Balakot is that it has a fair chance of surviving in a limited conflict.\u00a0However,\u00a0deploying the military is more of a defensive option.\u00a0And the offensive option, in the form\u00a0of a substantial increase in cross-border militancy,\u00a0continues to have its limitations because of the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s (FATF)\u00a0growing pressure on Pakistan. Those restrictions have not gone away,\u00a0which is one of the reasons for General Bajwa\u2019s continued carefulness in not excessively aggravating the situation at the LoC. As a senior journalist that I spoke with argued, \u201cIf Bajwa didn\u2019t escalate soon after India\u2019s revocation of Article 370 when there was visible anxiety in the armed forces, then he may not do it now when he is in a more stable position\u201d.\n\nIndia must look cautiously at its neighbourhood where patronage\u00a0from\u00a0China will make things more difficult as is obvious from the case of Nepal. Notwithstanding Pakistan\u2019s security relations with China, it is not becoming\u00a0another\u00a0Kathmandu and shouldn\u2019t be treated as one.\u00a0New\u00a0Delhi may be anxious about\u00a0the\u00a0possibility of a two-front situation, but\u00a0must also recognise\u00a0that Islamabad has not entirely tilted towards Beijing for its own needs that are totally unrelated to India. In fact, if anything, Pakistan would like to keep a balance between\u00a0the\u00a0big powers and other states strategically important to it. While driven by the desire to demonstrate its strength against China, India must think more cautiously about the behaviour of its neighbourhood. Showing Beijing intent to defend may be important but its\u00a0equally necessary to keep the regional temperature down.\n\nThe author is research associate at SOAS, London and author of\n\nMilitary Inc\n\n.

If they is indeed so much concern from Pakistani army about number of Indian army in Ladakh,  just stopping LOC fire will indicate your intent and take away any excuse, if there is any, for Indian army.  Pakistani authorities need to be clear in that mind that this is a Sino-India problem and they can chose to look other way.  Even of you do not trust India, no reason to believe that India will open a new frontier while having trouble with another one. As for Kathmandu, India is much more relaxed and just like Sri Lanka and Maldives before this, can be brought to status quo ante in due course.

In the sixties it did not respond to Nehru\u2019s forward policy until Russia and US  were paralyzed by the Cuban crisis and then it acted decisively. When Russia unexpectedly chickened out China meekly withdrew and abandoned its aim of reaching the Bay of Bengal. It however like a skilled GO player managed to retain the vital Aksai Chin area and adroitly avoided defining its border with India treating it as an ill defined LAC. For a GO player timing rather than time is the key.The Kargil conflict again provided it with an opportunity to move a wee bit in the Lake area. Later it did not waste the opportunity in Doklam nor has it wasted the current opening provided by abrogation of Article 370 and perhaps the COVID. China would be quiet content to wait and grow at 7-8% while India\u2019s GDP remains negative or much less than China due to the cost imposed on it by some tactical threatening moves which serve to tie down India while simultaneously protecting Aksai Chin area. China which in its play considers timing more important than time knows that in just 50 years an ecological disaster will overtake the subcontinent but spare China. Waiting 50 years is no big deal in the Chinese version of the game.\n\nReply\n\nRajvir Singh\n\n5 July, 2020 at 11:05 am\n\nLol, you have lot of expectations from China, let me make it clear to you a disaster going to happen PRC.

China\u2019s ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing, was also present in the ceremony.\n\nThe Azad Pattan hydropower plant is proposed to be built on Jhelum River near Sudhanoti in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\nKhan and Yao were also present in a similar ceremony a few days earlier when Pakistan Government signed a $ 2.4 billion agreement with a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation for construction of the 1124 MW hydropower plant on the Jhelum River itself at Kohala near Muzaffarabad in PoK.\n\nEarlier, the Power Construction Corporation of China, a.k.a. \u201cPower China\u201d, has tied up with the Frontier Works Organization (FWO), a construction farm of Pakistan Army, to float a consortium, which was awarded by Khan Government on May 13 a $ 2.75 billion contract to build the controversial Diamer Bhasha dam on Indus River in Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nThe Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) of Pakistan signed the agreement with the consortium on Wednesday, awarding it the contract to build the main dam of the Diamer Bhasha hydroelectric project and an access bridge. The contract awarded to the consortium of the Power China and the FWO also covers construction of the 21 MW Tangir Hydro-Electric plant, which was envisaged to power the construction of the main 4500 MW Diamer-Bhasha project at a later stage.\n\nNew Delhi has since long been opposing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which passes through the areas of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh under illegal occupation of Pakistan. The CPEC is one of the flagship projects of China\u2019s ambitious cross-continental Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). New Delhi opposed the BRI, primarily because the CPEC undermined the sovereignty of India.\n\nDeccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to subscribe\n\nIndia\n\nChina\n\nPakistan\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\nPoK\n\nPeople's Liberation Army\n\nLadakh\n\nRelated stories\n\nIndian returns home after serving jail term in Pakistan...\n\n'Covid-19 reinfection very rare, not matter of concern'...\n\n'Boundary with China based on geographical principle'\n\n'WTO 'completely inadequate' on China trade violations'\n\nPM Modi running away from discussion on China: Congress...\n\nDoval quits SCO meet as Pak map includes parts...\n\nWhat's Brewing\n\nWrong turn led whales to crocodile-infested river?\n\nWant cheaper beer?

Photo: Xinhua\n\nChinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Pakistani Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi held the second round of China-Pakistan Foreign Ministers' Strategic Dialogue in South China's Hainan Province on Friday.\n\nChina and Pakistan in November 2018 elevated the China-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue to the foreign ministers' level.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of China-India border tensions, and days after the first anniversary of India's revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, India may see the dialogue between China and Pakistan as a strategic alliance targeting India. However, based on China's current stance in South Asia, China hopes to deal with its frictions with India bilaterally. There is no need for China to build such an \"alliance.\" China has sufficient capability, and leverage to deal with India on its own.\n\nIn terms of Kashmir, the Chinese side reiterated that \"the Kashmir issue is a dispute left over from history between India and Pakistan, and China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation.\"\n\nIn response to China's stance, Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Saturday said India rejected a reference to Jammu and Kashmir in the joint press release and said it was tantamount to interference in India's internal affairs, Hindustan Times reported.\n\nSuch a response from New Delhi was not unexpected. India insists on its position on Kashmir no matter what the relevant stances of China, Pakistan and the international community are. In fact, India's removal of Kashmir's special autonomous status is beyond India's internal affairs. This is because Kashmir is a disputed region between India and Pakistan which is widely recognized by the international community. Furthermore, after revocation of its special autonomous status, the custom and life styles of local residents, especially Muslims, will be greatly impacted. India's position in terms of the statement on Kashmir in the joint press release will not affect China's stance on this disputed region.\n\nSrivastava on Saturday also reiterated India's opposition to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), saying it passes through \"the territory of India that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan.\" New Delhi has spared no effort in thwarting the construction of the CPEC, and opposed and demonized the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as the CPEC is an important component of the BRI. The CPEC makes India feel threatened in terms of strategic and national security. Although China has clarified that CPEC is only an economic project, and will not pose any threat to India's security, these assurances have been in vain and cannot alter India's bias. In this context, New Delhi will object to any improvement on the project.\n\nChina will not abandon the CPEC just because of India's opposition. On the contrary, China will keep promoting it. Given China's strong national strength as well as its comprehensive cooperation with Pakistan, India can hardly hinder the CPEC's development.\n\nWhile some Western countries, led by the US, have repeatedly provoked China when it comes to China's internal affairs including those of Hong Kong and Taiwan, Pakistan on Friday reaffirmed its firm support for China's core interests and issues of major concern, such as those related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. This has been Pakistan's consistent position on these issues.\n\nBoth sides also reaffirmed their commitment to support multilateralism, and opposition to unilateralism, protectionism and coercive practices and support the WHO to play a leading role in global public health governance. While the US has withdrawn from some of international organizations, and is shunning its responsibility as a great power, the statement by China and Pakistan is of great significance to the international community in jointly fighting the pandemic and global development. It also underlines China's image as a responsible power.\n\nThe author is a research fellow at the Shanghai Institute for International Studies. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn\n\nRELATED ARTICLES:\n\nXi says China-Pakistan Economic Corridor of great importance to promoting bilateral ties\n\nChina, Pakistan eye CPEC long term\n\nPosted in:\n\nASIAN REVIEW\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\n\ncomments powered by Disqus.\n\nblog comments powered by\n\nDisqus\n\nload_file(\"/includes/adv_right.html\");\n\nload_file(\"/includes/footer.html\");\n", "date": "2020-08-23", "label": true, "url": "https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1198627.shtml"}

(Photo courtesy PID/Radio Pakistan)\n\nISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN - Pakistan and close ally China have formally launched construction at a multibillion-dollar dam in the Pakistan-administered part of the disputed Kashmir region, ignoring rival India\u2019s objections to the project.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan visited the site Wednesday along with top military leaders and the Chinese ambassador in Islamabad to mark what officials hailed as a \"historic milestone.\u201d\n\nThe Diamer Bhasha multipurpose dam is expected to be completed in 2028, with a total cost of more than $8 billion. It is expected to generate 4,500 megawatts of inexpensive and clean electricity.\n\n\u201cThis will be Pakistan\u2019s third large dam, whereas neighboring China has built nearly 5,000 large dams out of its more than 80,000 dams in total,\u201d Khan said.\n\nThe dam, with a usable storage capacity of about 6.5 million acre-feet of water, will stand at a height of 272 meters in northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, about 400 kilometers from Pakistan\u2019s only overland crossing with China.\n\nOfficials said the project will also help in flood control and add 1.2 million acres of agriculture land, in addition to creating 16,000 jobs for local residents.\n\nA consortium of state-owned China Power and the Pakistan army\u2019s commercial wing, Frontier Works Organization (FWO), is building the project on a 70-to-30 ratio.\n\nIndia, which controls most of Kashmir and claims it in its entirety, as does Pakistan, has denounced the project as a violation of its territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe Pakistani and Chinese governments have rejected Indian concerns as misplaced, insisting the economic collaboration is aimed at improving \u201cthe well-being of the local people.\u201d\n\nCPEC collaboration\n\nThe dam, however, is not part of the ongoing multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, a centerpiece of President Xi Jinping\u2019s global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nBeijing has also signed within the past month two agreements with Islamabad under the CPEC to directly invest up to $4 billion to develop two hydroelectric power projects in Kashmir, with a total capacity of about 1,800 megawatts.\n\nMichael Kugelman, deputy director at the Asia program of the Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center, sees the growing Chinese investments in Pakistan-administered Kashmir a blow to India.\n\n\u201cThese moves will bring one more tension point to an India-China relationship that is already more strained now than it has been for several decades,\u201d he said.\n\nKugelman was referring to last month\u2019s border clash between the two countries in the western Himalayas in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Chinese and Indian officials are currently engaged in talks to ease the tensions.\n\n\u201cWe can also read them, in part, as a defiant response by both Beijing and Islamabad to increasing Indian verbal threats in recent months to make some sort of move on Pakistan-administered Kashmir,\u201d said Kugelman.\n\nIndian leaders have repeatedly alleged in recent months that militants are preparing to infiltrate into India-controlled Kashmir from the Pakistani side and warned of a cross-border counter military action which would fuel mutual tensions.\n\nChina has invested about $29 billion in Pakistan, including direct investment, soft loans and grants, which has been or is building power plants, roads, rails, the new deep-sea port of Gwadar and an adjoining international airport in Baluchistan province.\n\nChinese and Pakistani officials say the investment has created an estimated 75,000 jobs for locals and effectively reduced, if not ended, years of crippling power blackouts in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cDespite the outbreak of COVID-19, work on the CPEC has been underway in full swing, and new projects under the mutual collaboration will be launched in coming days,\u201d Asim Saleem Bajwa, an aide to the prime minister who is overseeing the massive the program, told a recent meeting of Pakistani and Chinese officials.\n\nBajwa was apparently responding to reports that the coronavirus pandemic has slowed work on CPEC projects.\n\n'Debt trap'\n\nCPEC investments, however, have worried critics at home and outside Pakistan, who have expressed concerns and skepticism in the wake of the financial crunch facing the country.\n\nThe United States also has been critical of the bilateral undertaking.\n\nAlice Wells, who recently retired as the Trump administration\u2019s senior diplomat for South and Central Asia, had been publicly warning that Chinese investments under the CPEC could become a debt trap for Pakistan in the long run, citing relatively high costs and alleged lack of transparency in contracts, among other concerns.\n\n\u201cHopefully, not at the cost of Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty, environment, sustainability of debt or corruption. This is a good time to renegotiate BRI terms that, in hindsight, were disadvantageous or one-sided,\u201d Wells tweeted earlier this month.\n\nShe was responding to comments by Khan that his government would complete the estimated $40 billion to $60 billion CPEC project \u201cat any cost\u201d for it being \u201cthe future of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nIslamabad and Beijing have vehemently rejected as misplaced concerns about the CPEC being a \u201cdebt trap\u201d or a burden on Pakistan\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cCPEC, as flagship of BRI, is already a success story, and has entered its second phase successfully,\" noted Mushahid Hussain, who heads the Pakistani Senate\u2019s foreign affairs committee. \u201cEnergy and infrastructure projects have been completed on schedule, 75,000 Pakistanis have got jobs in BRI projects, and 28,000 Pakistani students are studying in China.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nMilitant Ambush Kills 3 Pakistani Troops in Baluchistan\n\nSeparatist group takes responsibility for attack that also left five soldiers in critical condition\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nTue, 07/14/2020 - 02:52 PM\n\nScience & Health\n\nPakistan to Resume Anti-Polio Drive as COVID-19 Infections Decline\n\nWHO warns poliovirus transmission in Pakistan 'continues to be widespread'\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nTue, 07/14/2020 - 12:16 PM\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nCOVID Cooperation, Kashmir Approach Show Signs of Improving US-Pakistan Ties\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan told parliament last week that his country's often uneasy and mistrusted relations with Trump's administration have seen significant improvement over the past two years\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nFri, 07/03/2020 - 12:04 PM\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nCaught Between Virus and Violence in Indian Kashmir\n\nEver since the Indian government enforced a lockdown in Kashmir following the outbreak of COVID-19, violence has surged in the area\n\nBy\n\nMuheet Ul Islam\n\nTue, 06/30/2020 - 05:46 AM\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nFacebook\n\nYouTube\n\nRSS\n\nSwitch to Dark mode\n\nSwitch to Light mode\n\nSearch VOA News\n\nSearch\n\nUnited States\n\nUS Politics\n\nImmigration\n\nAll About America\n\nSilicon Valley and Technology\n\nWorld News\n\nAfrica\n\nThe Americas\n\nEast Asia Pacific\n\nEurope\n\nMiddle East\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nSections\n\nArts & Culture\n\nDay in Photos\n\nEconomy & Business\n\nExtremism Watch\n\nPress Freedom\n\nScience & Health\n\nVOA StudentU\n\nVOA Connect\n\nRefugees\n\nVoice of America\n\nAbout VOA\n\nContact VOA\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Notice\n\nAccessibility\n\nGet Our Mobile App\n\nUsage Requests\n\nVOA Around the World\n\nVOA Pronunciation Guide\n\nMedia Relations\n\nListen on the radio\n\nSatellite Schedule\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletters\n", "date": "2020-07-15", "label": true, "url": "https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/chinas-investments-pakistan-administered-kashmir-seen-blow-india"}

The local people look after it. The wildlife population has increased manifold,\" he said.\n\nIn its latest move to generate jobs amid the COVID-19 pandemic while boosting conservation and curbing the impacts of climate change, Pakistan has announced the creation of Pakistan's first National Parks Service, modeled on the U.S. agency.\n\nUnder it, the country aims to get more local communities involved in running national parks and earning an income as they protect nearby conservation areas.\n\nThe first phase of the Protected Areas Initiative, launched on July 2, will focus on 15 national parks that make up a total of 7,300 sq km (2,800 sq miles), spanning from Khunjerab in the north to the area around Astola Island in the south.\n\nThe project aims to create up to 5,000 new jobs, mainly for young people who will work as park guards and custodians, and boost eco-tourism in the country, authorities said when the initiative was announced.\n\nMalik Amin Aslam, climate change advisor to Prime Minister Imran Khan, said the parks plan fits into Pakistan's post-coronavirus \"green stimulus\" vision, which also includes\n\nhiring thousands of unemployed day labourers to plant trees\n\nas part of the country's 10 Billion Tree Tsunami program.\n\n\"The dual objective is to protect nature while also generating jobs for unemployed youth,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\u00a0\"All this green activity will aid in addressing the unexpected spike in COVID-linked unemployment across the country.\"\n\n'PAPER PARKS'\n\nPakistan currently has about 30 national parks that are supposed to be protected and preserved by law.\n\nBut most are \"paper parks\" \u2014\u00a0areas classified as national parks but with little or no management, said Aslam, who helped design the new initiative.\n\nConservation expert Anis ur Rahman estimates only about 5% of the country's parks are properly managed.\n\nThe others suffer from clashing priorities and a lack of cooperation between the government and the communities that live around them and rely on them for grazing, hunting and firewood, he explained.\n\nMore on green initiatives around the world\n\nAs a 'Green Stimulus,' Pakistan Sets Virus-Idled to Work Planting Trees\n\nAfghanistan Hires Lockdown Jobless to Boost Kabul's Water and Trees\n\n10 Global Cities Charting a Green Recovery from Coronavirus\n\nSolar Pumps, Migrant Homes Help Shield Post-Coronavirus World\n\nDespite the Pandemic, Frontline Nations Push Ahead on Stronger Climate Plans\n\n\"In many cases, the government changed the status of these old community-managed forest areas or grazing areas into national parks where (suddenly) everything is prohibited by law,\" said Rahman, who heads the management board for Margalla Hills National Park, one of those included in the new project.\n\n\"But there is\n\nweak enforcement\n\n. The government does not have the resources to pay for adequate protection,\" he said.\n\nMany of the country's environmental experts see Khunjerab, the country's oldest and largest national park, as a model of successful community-led management.\n\nThe park was established 45 years ago as a way to protect the area's glaciers, alpine pastures, streams and ravines.\n\nParts of it were closed off to create undisturbed habitat for animals from the rare Marco Polo sheep to snow leopards and Siberian ibex.\n\nBut that move\n\npitted the government against local livestock farmers\n\n, who had long used the area.\n\nAshiq Ahmed Khan, a wildlife specialist working at the government's Pakistan Forest Institute in the 1990s, helped draft the first management plan for the park that brought together locals and the provincial wildlife department.\n\nUnder the plan, eight villages inside the park agreed not to graze livestock in its 12-square-kilometer\u00a0core zone.\n\nIn exchange, other grazing areas were designated on a rotation that gave each time to recover after being used, noted Khan, who is now retired.\n\nCommunity members were employed as guards and game inspectors, with 80% of employment opportunities in the park going to locals. It was also agreed that local communities would receive 75% of the revenue generated by visitor fees.\n\n\"It really was the first national park in the country whose management plan was actually implemented,\" Khan said.\u00a0\"Today there are 100 Marco Polo sheep in the park, much more than the eight or nine I saw (in the 1990s) and there are more than 5,000 ibex.\"\n\nSTRONGER LAWS?\n\nARCHIVE PHOTO: A view of an entrance area at Khunjerab National Park in Pakistan, August 19, 2017. | Thomson Reuters Foundation/Rina Saeed Khan\n\nSo far, Pakistan's authorities have revealed few details about the new Protected Areas Initiative.\n\nAslam, the climate change advisor, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the project will be overseen by Pakistan's new National Parks Service, due to launch in September.\n\nHe said the country had earmarked 4 billion rupees ($24 million) for the initiative's first phase over the next three years, of which at least 80% would be spent on creating green jobs and increasing community engagement.\n\nThrough the project, the amount of protected land in Pakistan will increase from 13% to 15% by 2023, Aslam added.\n\nBut environmental lawyer Rafay Ahmad Alam said that while the initiative is a positive step, it will do little to help preserve Pakistan's green spaces without legislation to back it up.\n\nThe initiative \"won't make up for the fact that (most of) the provincial national park laws are weak and don't provide adequate specifics for conservation, protection or enforcement measures,\" he said.\n\nAslam agreed that proper provincial legislation is essential and noted that changes to policy are also part of the new plan.\n\nThe shift to community-managed parks offers the chance to tap into the \"amazing indigenous knowledge\" that local people possess about the land, Muzaffar ud Din said.\n\n\"Local communities have more information and they can manage their own natural resources better. They have better vision,\" he said.\u00a0\"National parks should not be viewed as a separate entity, but as part of the overall socio-economic and physical landscape. That is the future of conservation.\"\n\nReporting by Rina Saeed Khan, Editing by Jumana Farouky and Laurie Goering.\n\nComment\n\nSupport the Articles you Love\n\nWe are dedicated to providing you with articles like this one.

The local people look after it. The wildlife population has increased manifold,\u201d he said.\n\nIn its latest move to generate jobs amid the COVID-19 pandemic while boosting conservation and curbing the impacts of climate change, Pakistan has announced the creation of Pakistan\u2019s first National Parks Service, modeled on the U.S. agency.\n\nUnder it, the country aims to get more local communities involved in running national parks and earning an income as they protect nearby conservation areas.\n\nThe first phase of the Protected Areas Initiative, launched on July 2, will focus on 15 national parks that make up a total of 7,300 sq km (2,800 sq miles), spanning from Khunjerab in the north to the area around Astola Island in the south.\n\nThe project aims to create up to 5,000 new jobs, mainly for young people who will work as park guards and custodians, and boost eco-tourism in the country, authorities said when the initiative was announced.\n\nMalik Amin Aslam, climate change advisor to Prime Minister Imran Khan, said the parks plan fits into Pakistan\u2019s post-coronavirus \u201cgreen stimulus\u201d vision, which also includes hiring thousands of unemployed day labourers to plant trees as part of the country\u2019s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.\n\nhere\n\n\u201cThe dual objective is to protect nature while also generating jobs for unemployed youth,\u201d he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\u201cAll this green activity will aid in addressing the unexpected spike in COVID-linked unemployment across the country.\u201d\n\n\u2018PAPER PARKS\u2019\n\nPakistan currently has about 30 national parks that are supposed to be protected and preserved by law.\n\nBut most are \u201cpaper parks\u201d - areas classified as national parks but with little or no management, said Aslam, who helped design the new initiative.\n\nConservation expert Anis ur Rahman estimates only about 5% of the country\u2019s parks are properly managed.\n\nThe others suffer from clashing priorities and a lack of cooperation between the government and the communities that live around them and rely on them for grazing, hunting and firewood, he explained.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, the government changed the status of these old community-managed forest areas or grazing areas into national parks where (suddenly) everything is prohibited by law,\u201d said Rahman, who heads the management board for Margalla Hills National Park, one of those included in the new project.\n\n\u201cBut there is weak enforcement. The government does not have the resources to pay for adequate protection,\u201d he said.\n\nMany of the country\u2019s environmental experts see Khunjerab, the country\u2019s oldest and largest national park, as a model of successful community-led management.\n\nThe park was established 45 years ago as a way to protect the area\u2019s glaciers, alpine pastures, streams and ravines.\n\nParts of it were closed off to create undisturbed habitat for animals from the rare Marco Polo sheep to snow leopards and Siberian ibex.\n\nBut that move pitted the government against local livestock farmers, who had long used the area.\n\nhere\n\nAshiq Ahmed Khan, a wildlife specialist working at the government\u2019s Pakistan Forest Institute in the 1990s, helped draft the first management plan for the park that brought together locals and the provincial wildlife department.\n\nUnder the plan, eight villages inside the park agreed not to graze livestock in its 12-square-kilometre core zone.\n\nIn exchange, other grazing areas were designated on a rotation that gave each time to recover after being used, noted Khan, who is now retired.\n\nCommunity members were employed as guards and game inspectors, with 80% of employment opportunities in the park going to locals. It was also agreed that local communities would receive 75% of the revenue generated by visitor fees.\n\n\u201cIt really was the first national park in the country whose management plan was actually implemented,\u201d Khan said.\n\n\u201cToday there are 100 Marco Polo sheep in the park, much more than the eight or nine I saw (in the 1990s) and there are more than 5,000 ibex.\u201d\n\nSTRONGER LAWS?\n\nSo far, Pakistan\u2019s authorities have revealed few details about the new Protected Areas Initiative.\n\nAslam, the climate change advisor, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the project will be overseen by Pakistan\u2019s new National Parks Service, due to launch in September.\n\nHe said the country had earmarked 4 billion rupees ($24 million) for the initiative\u2019s first phase over the next three years, of which at least 80% would be spent on creating green jobs and increasing community engagement.\n\nThrough the project, the amount of protected land in Pakistan will increase from 13% to 15% by 2023, Aslam added.\n\nBut environmental lawyer Rafay Ahmad Alam said that while the initiative is a positive step, it will do little to help preserve Pakistan\u2019s green spaces without legislation to back it up.\n\nThe initiative \u201cwon\u2019t make up for the fact that (most of) the provincial national park laws are weak and don\u2019t provide adequate specifics for conservation, protection or enforcement measures,\u201d he said.\n\nAslam agreed that proper provincial legislation is essential and noted that changes to policy are also part of the new plan.\n\nThe shift to community-managed parks offers the chance to tap into the \u201camazing indigenous knowledge\u201d that local people possess about the land, Muzaffar ud Din said.\n\n\u201cLocal communities have more information and they can manage their own natural resources better. They have better vision,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNational parks should not be viewed as a separate entity, but as part of the overall socio-economic and physical landscape. That is the future of conservation.\u201d\n\nReporting by Rina Saeed Khan, Editing by Jumana Farouky and Laurie Goering.

He was shocked to see gross violation of human rights in the \u2018re-education centres\u2019 and became a global voice against Chinese oppression of Uighurs. Edited excerpts of an interview with Jazexhi:\n\nYou have visited these concentration camps in China. How did you manage to reach there?\n\nI had a keen interest to know what is going on in Xinjiang with the Muslim community. For this reason, I contacted the Chinese Embassy in Tirana, Albania, in July 2019. I told our Chinese friends that I doubted the story that I was seeing in western media about the Uighurs and China\u2019s treatment of Muslims. I told them that I wanted to prove the Western narrative about Xinjiang to be wrong. Our Chinese colleagues in Tirana liked my profile and invited me, like they have invited other journalists in the past to see the situation in Xinjiang.\n\nFrom August 16 to August 25, 2019, I visited Xinjiang on the invitation of the State Council Information Office of China and Xinjiang. I was part of a group of journalists who were sent to visit three major cities: Urumqi, Aksu, and Kashgar.\n\nThese concentration camps are unknown world for many. Kindly explain what all you saw there and condition of youth.\n\nChina is very good in concealing its doings. What we call in the West as concentration camps, China calls \u2018Vocational Training Centers\u2019. The Chinese government claims that in these centers, it fights terrorism and de-radicalises extremists.\n\nHowever, during our visit to these centers, we found that the people whom China calls \u201cstudents\u201d of the \u201cVocational Training Centers\u201d were prisoners. They were not terrorists and extremists but Turkic people who were not Han Chinese. Their crime was to be Muslim and Indo-European. The Chinese were forcing them to renounce their Turkic language, culture and Islamic religion. In these centers, they were forced to eat non-halal food, to cheer and give loyalty to Xi Jinping and the Communist Party of China, speak Chinese 24 hours per day and renounce their Islamic culture. Their crime was being a Muslim. We did not find any terrorist, extremist or suicide bomber in these camps.\n\nAre you suggesting these youths are brought in here for brainwashing? To impose ideology by the state?\n\nYes indeed. I have video recordings which you can see on my YouTube channel where you can see people with Islamic names like Aisha, Summayah, Mahmut etc who have been locked in these mass detention centers only because two years before they had prayed to Allah, made Islamic religious marriage, had put headscarf and consumed halal food. When interviewed by me, these people, who two years before were believers of Allah, now were renouncing their faith and telling to me that they do not believe in Islam anymore, but believe in science and in the Communist Party of China.\n\nThey were afraid even to speak their Turkic language but were struggling to learn the language of Beijing. Chinese state propaganda was that Xinjiang had been Buddhist and Islam was imposed by the Turks and the Arabs and China was making sure to turn Xinjiang back to the Buddhist civilization. China is forcefully Sinicizing the people of Xinjiang.\n\nWe have seen your videos and they look like as someone surrounded you. It was like a guided tour?\n\nYes. We were in guided tours. Our Chinese friends wanted us to take pictures of Muslim prisoners who were singing and dancing in Han Chinese and wanted us to tell the world that all was fine in Xinjiang and China was \u2018civilising\u2019 its Muslims by making them Chinese. Our Chinese friends did not allow us free movement in cities. Everything was guided and under strict supervision of Communist officials.\n\nYou think China is successful in hiding the fact from the world about Uighur Muslims atrocities in China?\n\nYes. China is very successful in hiding its cultural genocide against the Islamic and Indo-European culture of the Altai Mountains and East Turkestan. It is succeeding in mass assimilation and crushing the Uighur, Turkmen, Kirghiz, Kazakh and Tatar people of Xinjiang and forcefully converting them into the Han Chinese culture. China is succeeding in doing what Hitler failed to do with the Jews.\n\nAnd why you say this is a systematic attack to eliminate an ethic race from China?\n\nOur visit and filming in Xinjiang proved beyond doubt that China is erasing more than 3,000 years of Turkic, Indian and Islamic civilisation from Xinjiang. It is colonising and destroying the Indo-European demography of Xinjiang by force. China sees Xinjiang and Aksai Chin as important gateways for its imperialist advance towards Asia and Indian subcontinent. It does not want any foreign power to arm and use the Uighurs and turn Xinjiang into a Chinese Afghanistan. It perceives the Turkic and Islamic people of Xinjiang as major threat for its future imperialist expansion. For this reason it is doing a final solution for them: Mass Sinification through colonization, cultural genocide and brainwashing.\n\nOIC is silent and good friend Pakistan is also not coming for the help of Muslims in China. How should the world take this situation?\n\nPakistan stands between two fires. On one side it faces a powerful India. On the other hand it has to kiss China\u2019s hand since it desperately needs Chinese money and weapons to defend itself from India. If Pakistan was to be on peace terms with India, it would have condemned what China is doing. But as things stand, it cannot say anything.\n\nRegarding OIC \u2013 most Arab dictatorships do know what China is doing with its Uighur Muslims but they do not care. During our visit in Xinjiang, we had with us journalists from Saudi Arabia and Emirates who saw how China was imprisoning people only because they were Muslims \u2013 but nothing was reported in the Gulf Countries.\n\nArab dictatorships need China. It supplies them with weapons, high tech and money. China is the best friend of dictators. However, Muslim countries like Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia etc are speaking up against China. While the OIC speaks about Palestine and Kashmir, it must speak about Xinjiang too.\n\nThe reason why many Islamic countries choose to side with the lesser evil \u2013 China and accept to ignore the suffering of their East Turkestani Muslim brothers, is related to US imperialism. They see China as the \u2018Shaytan\u2019 which we can work with.\n\nRead More\n\nMicrosoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through recommended links in this article\n\nTOPICS FOR YOU\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nAd\n\nMicrosoft\n\n#KeepAWatch on your Vitals In Real Time with GOQii\n\nGOQii\n\nPower new possibilities\n\nDell\n\nElectronics and accessories at amazing discounts.

Researchers in many countries have reported that, in addition to detention, Uighurs are being subjected to torture, forced labor, and sterilization. And two Uighur groups have accused the Chinese authorities of physical and cultural genocide in a complaint filed with the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe author Anne Applebaum has compared Western indifference to what is happening in Xinjiang today with the willful determination of European governments and the Vatican to ignore the famine Joseph Stalin engineered in Ukraine in 1932-33, and the Nazi concentration camps a decade later. One might add more recent examples to the list. Viewed against this background, the United States' willingness to condemn China's behavior and impose costs for it, even if only with individual sanctions, is a step in the right direction.\n\nMoreover, this step might well gain the attention of Muslims in countries like Pakistan, Indonesia, and Turkey. The Pakistani and Indonesian governments are willing to play by Chinese rules in order to secure investment; Pakistan signed a letter last year defending China's treatment of Uighurs, while the Indonesian government says that it \"will not meddle in the internal affairs of China.\" Turkey initially offered Uighurs asylum in the 1950s when Chinese communists took over Xinjiang. Today, Turkish police are reportedly arresting Uighur activists and sending them without explanation to deportation centers, sometimes for months.\n\nIn this context, a broad U.S.-led effort to hold the Chinese government even partly to international account for its treatment of Uighurs \u2015 particularly at a time when America is having to reckon with its own current and past racist crimes \u2015 could mark an important turning point. At the very least, it would remind China that the world is watching.\n\nSadly, Trump's actions will likely convince Muslims only of the depths of his hypocrisy. Trump signed the UHRPA on the same day that allegations contained in his former national security adviser John Bolton's new book were flooding the airwaves. According to Bolton, Trump was not merely indifferent toward Uighurs' human rights, but actively encouraged Chinese President Xi Jinping to build concentration camps to hold them.\n\nThen there are Trump's own Muslim travel bans. The initial ban, issued in January 2017, barred all refugees and immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S.; the measure was struck down by the courts and then revised several times until it passed constitutional muster. Since then, numerous stories have emerged demonstrating the devastating and potentially life-threatening impact of these restrictions on refugees, Muslims, and non-Muslims living in the designated countries.\n\nOne of those affected is Afkab Hussein, a former Somali refugee now living in Columbus, Ohio. Afkab has been waiting since 2015 for his wife and young children to join him in the U.S., but Trump's bans have prevented them from doing so. Trump's support for a law that calls on the Chinese authorities to permit re-establishment of contact between people in China and outside the country therefore rings hollow.\n\nThe UHRPA also accuses the Chinese government of \"using wide-scale, internationally-linked threats of terrorism as a pretext to justify pervasive restrictions on and serious human rights violations\" against Uighurs and others in Xinjiang. But Trump's executive orders seeking to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. included similar clauses.\n\nHis first executive order cited the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S. as a justification for banning refugees and immigrants from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, despite the absence of evidence that citizens of any of these countries, much less refugees, carried out the attacks. Subsequent iterations of the ban continued to cite terrorism as a rationale. In practice, however, the Trump administration has merely blocked family members from joining loved ones in the U.S., and reduced admissions of vulnerable refugees to historically low levels.\n\nThe tension between Trump's belated embrace of Uighur rights and his all-too-evident dislike of Muslims (unless they are Saudi princes) raises the deeper question of who the ultimate audience is for America's \u2015 or any country's \u2015 foreign policy. Ordinary Muslims can have no doubt about how Trump feels about them, no matter what he might say to their governments. They only have to follow his Twitter feed or watch his press conferences.\n\nTrump is the first U.S. president to disdain normal processes for crafting and vetting official statements, preferring instead to engage directly with US voters and citizens of other countries via social media. But although he has mobilized a large constituency, he has also succeeded in alienating large segments of the public in America and elsewhere. His denigration of entire populations \u2015 such as calling Mexicans rapists or Muslims terrorists \u2015 resonate louder and longer than any official statements issued by the White House or the U.S. State Department.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether those impressions will outlast Trump's presidency. The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the \"No Ban Act,\" which would repeal the Muslim travel ban and prevent the use of religious discrimination to bar immigrants. And if a new U.S. administration succeeds Trump following November's presidential election, it will have to address other countries' governments and citizens with one voice \u2015 and without the glaring hypocrisy to which they have grown accustomed.\n\nAnne-Marie Slaughter, a former director of policy planning in the U.S. State Department (2009-11), is CEO of the think tank New America, professor emerita of politics and international Affairs at Princeton University, and the author of \"Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family.\" Wardah Khalid, a foreign-policy analyst and activist, is a Security Fellow at the Truman National Security Project.

(Photo| AFP)\n\nBy\n\nANI\n\nOTTAWA: During a hearing before the House of Commons human-rights subcommittee, several experts called out China for human rights violation in Xinjiang where Beijing has locked up millions of Uyghurs.\n\nMultiple experts called the Chinese out on systematic destruction of Uyghur identity, history, religion, culture, language; use of concentration camps, termed as re-education camps; use of prisoners to harvest organs and use of prisoners to make beauty products.\n\nThey also pointed out the forced nationalism training and indoctrination, teaching Mandarin Chinese and Han agents living with Uyghur families to indoctrinate them.\n\nREAD|\n\nChina forcing Uyghur labourers to produce COVID-19 PPE kits for export: Report\n\nThere have been allegations of Chinese Communist Party keeping its members in families whose men have been sent to prisoner camps.\n\nChina has also faced allegations of children being sent to state-run orphanages. With high-tech 24/7 surveillance, China has virtually converted the entire province into a prison.\n\nSeveral Islamic countries including Pakistan and Iran have not criticised China for its actions in Xinjiang. Pakistan, in particular, has refused to do that.\n\nSpeakers, which included - Dr Adrian Zenz, Olsi Jazexhi, David Kilgour, Dr Raziya Mahmoud, Jacob Kavalio, Garnett Genius and David Sweet pointed out about the blatant abuse of human rights being carried out in Xinjiang.\n\nThey pointed out the massive drop in population growth rate in the province. The speakers noted how people are deprived of communicating from their families.\n\nThey also mentioned about the systematic oppression against Uyghurs in the CCP regime and unprecedented scales of oppression with up to 3 million people locked up where they undergo torture and brainwashing.\n\nThe CCP has turned the region into a \"brutal totalitarian police state\" and everything unique about Uyghurs is \"systematically targeted\".\n\nThere have been growing calls for action against the Chinese officials involved in human rights violations in Xinjiang. The US had recently imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against senior officials over human rights violations in Xinjiang.\n\nWhat was Lebensraum for Nazi, is now China's aggressive foreign policy, said some of the speakers. Other noted how the prisoners are forced to work as labour for the companies.\n\nNow we are on Telegram too.

Chang (@GordonGChang)\n\nJuly 20, 2020\n\nChang, a Gatestone Institute Distinguished Senior Fellow and Advisory Board member, has been a vocal critic of the CCP and its torture and imprisonment of the Uighurs, including in\n\nhis latest article\n\nfor the group\u2019s website on the practice, first\n\nreported in March\n\n, of the Chinese using the forced, or slave labor of \u201cmore than 80,000 Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities to produce products for Nike and 82 other brands\u201d:\n\n#China\n\n's regime is institutionalizing slavery on an industrial scale.\n\n#Nike\n\nknows or should know that one of its primary suppliers is making its shoes with slave labor\u2013from a racial minority\u2013in that country. See:\n\nhttps://t.co/ccFdbW790Q\n\n.\n\n#UyghursNotForSale\n\n@GatestoneInst\n\n\u2014 Gordon G. Chang (@GordonGChang)\n\nJuly 21, 2020\n\nWith that mission in mind, the author of\u00a0 2001\u2019s\n\nThe Coming Collapse of China\n\nhas been sitting down for a slew of interviews \u2014 including on last night\u2019s \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d on Fox News. It wasn\u2019t Chang\u2019s first trip to Carlson\u2019s show, though. He\n\nstopped in\n\nearlier in July to talk to Carlson about allegations that Beijing tried to cover up the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s interview, Chang\n\ndid\n\nhave an answer to what was going on in that video, unlike the Chinese ambassador on BBC, when Carlson asked the same question.\n\nChang said:\n\n\u201cWe were looking at scenes from August 2018, in what the Chinese call Xinjiang, which the local inhabitants call East Turkistan.\n\nIt is believed, Tucker, that this is video shot by Chinese government drone, and this footage was leaked to the international community.\u201d\n\nThen Chang addressed the report released in March from the non-partisan Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which names the corporations \u2013 at least 83 \u2013 which are thought to be a part of the forced labor. It includes some well-known name brands:\n\n\u201cTwo of them were\n\nNike and Apple\n\n.\u201d [emphasis added]\n\nIn response, Carlson noted that he \u201cnever hears anybody on the Left criticize both companies for their labor practices,\u201d then asked his guest why he thinks that is.\n\nChang\u2019s answer was damning.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s inexplicable,\u201d then went on to explain how Nike has had a \u201crelationship\u201d through suppliers with the Chinese government for \u201cmore than three decades.\u201d And the conditions the workers are subjected to, he added, \u201ccan only be described as \u2018slave labor.'\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise to many Conservatives, of course. When you have such execrable outlets as the\n\nNew York Times\n\n, in a truly gross display of soft-pedaling over the weekend, publishing coverage on\n\nChinese face masks\n\npossibly being manufactured by Uighur forced labor, writing that it\u2019s happening \u201cthrough a contentious government-sponsored program that experts say often puts people to work against their will.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t say.\n\nAs my colleague Joe Cunningham has\n\ncovered thoroughly\n\nthis week, the multiple Chang interviews are just one more reason why Tucker Carlson is\n\nso \u201cdangerous\u201d\n\nto the mainstream media \u2014 he keeps circling the target and refuses to let up.\n\nI encourage you to watch the full Chang interview\n\nbelow\n\n, via Fox News:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/3dUaE7pMsgQ?t=1765\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nBecca Lower is a writer with RedState and formerly worked at IJR.com as a writer and editor.

Uighur Muslims in China are currently suffering some of the worst human rights abuses in the world, writes columnist Donna Miles-Mojab.\n\nOPINION:\n\nHow would you feel if men from the government were sent to stay in your house, 24/7, to ensure you and your family were patriotic and your political views adhered to the official doctrine?\n\nSounds like an unimaginable dystopian police state, doesn\u2019t it? But, according to Human Rights Watch, these \u201chome stays\u201d have been happening in China\u2019s biggest province, Xinjiang.\u200b\n\nThe families forced to sleep and eat under the watchful eye of the state are Uighur\u200b and other Turkic minority Muslims whose language, culture and religious beliefs are seen as a threat by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe state repression of Uighur Muslims \u2013 who form 11 million of Xinjiang\u2019s 22m inhabitants \u2013 has been going on for decades. Uighur activists, tired of economic and social marginalisation, want the region to become independent \u201cEast Turkestan\u201d.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n*\n\nChinese ambassador confronted on live television with Uighur prisoner footage\n\n*\n\nChina hits back at 'unbalanced' report claiming it's a threat to the world\n\n*\n\nUS cracks down on China over brutal treatment of ethnic Muslims\n\n*\n\nThe disappearing people: Uighur Kiwis lose contact with family members in China\n\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks, China took advantage of George W Bush\u2019s \u201cWar on Terror\u201d to brand all Uighur Muslims as potential extremists. A vast, secretive facial recognition network was set up to closely monitor Uighur Muslims throughout the Xinjiang region.\n\nIn 2018, Human Rights Watch reported the mass arbitrary detention and torture of Uighur Muslims whose contact with the outside world has been virtually cut off because every phone is closely tracked and controlled by the state.\n\nThe US State Department estimated the number of people held in various camps against their will to be between 1m and 3m.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that the Uighur Muslims held in these camps face political indoctrination, mandatory birth control, forced sterilisation, forced abortion, rape, torture and murder.\n\nChina has claimed the camps were voluntary vocational training centres and all the attendees have now \u201cgraduated\u201d. But Human Rights Watch and Uighur rights activists dispute this claim and continue to speak of \u201ccultural genocide\u201d where Uighur Muslims are forced to learn \u201cXi Jinping\u200b Thought\u201d and are made to denounce their own distinct identity in violation of the cultural rights of ethnic minorities under the international human rights law.\n\nThere is no doubt that Uighur Muslims in China are currently suffering some of the worst human rights abuses in the world. So, what is the international community doing about it?\n\nThere have been plenty of statements and joint letters condemning China\u2019s actions in Xinjiang.\n\nLast July, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan joined 18 European countries to express their concerns in an open letter to the UN. Later, 37 countries wrote back to defend China. Recently, our own Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has again\n\nspoken out against the treatment of Uighur Muslims\n\nand the\n\ncontroversial Hong Kong national security law\n\n.\n\nBut, so far, only the US has imposed targeted sanctions on China in response to the treatment of Uighur Muslims.\n\nKirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nBritain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, left, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London this week. Britain has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and blocked arms sales to the former British territory after China imposed a tough new national security law.\n\nA few days ago, the UK responded to the Hong Kong national security law by suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, warning: \u201cthe United Kingdom is watching. And the whole world is watching.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong national security is controversial because it removes legal and judicial safeguards for citizens of Hong Kong.\n\nWhen it comes to the Uighur Muslims though, the \u201cwhole world\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to be watching. What is particularly shocking is the shameful silence of Muslim majority countries. Apart from Turkey, no other Muslim country has openly condemned China.\n\nMohammed bin Salman\u200b of Saudi Arabia, the butcher in chief (lest we forget Jamal Khashoggi),\u200b said it was China\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to put Muslims in camps for anti-terror purposes. Pakistan spoke out strongly in support of Rohingya\u200b Muslims but has stayed silent about Uighurs.\n\nIran, an Islamic Republic and supposedly the champion of Muslims, has said nothing publicly. The silence of Egypt, Malaysia and Indonesia have been deafening too.\n\nWhy is that? Let\u2019s look at Iran as an example.\n\nPushed to the economic brink by US sanctions, Iran has opened its doors to China to ensure its security and survival. The two countries are close to agreeing a massive $400 billion investment deal which explains why Iran is unwilling to rock the boat and speak out against China.\n\nThe deal with Tehran is part of China\u2019s extensive Belt and Road Initiative \u2013 a global development strategy, involving infrastructure development and investments in nearly 70 countries.\n\nMany Muslim countries are included in China\u2019s strategic investments, which some have dubbed as \u201cdebt diplomacy\u201d.\n\nThe US sees the rise of China as a threat to its own global hegemony and as such, its long-term strategy is to contain China and treat it as a foe.\n\nMy worry is that treating China as an enemy might become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Of course, there are serious issues that need to be managed: human rights abuses and political interference,  China\u2019s behaviour towards its neighbours and the conflict in the South China Sea.\n\nBut one thing is clear: China cares about the global opinion. We must therefore continue to speak out against China\u2019s wrongdoings while recognising that some paranoia about China is just economic sour grapes.\n\nStuff\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhats App\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nmost popular\n\nElection 2020: The 'complete disarray' of National's campaign that led to electoral 'slaughter'\n\nMum takes sick daughter home rather than leave her in dirty, mouldy ward\n\nChristchurch first-home buyers face 'massive interest' and rising prices\n\nCovid-19: 11 new cases of coronavirus in managed isolation\n\nCoronavirus: New Zealanders commuting to meetings via $8k-an-hour private jet\n\nQuiz: Morning trivia challenge: October 24, 2020\n\nResidents in leafy Christchurch suburb called 'classist' for opposing social housing development\n\nLabour weekend traffic: Crashes across the country lead to road closures, delays\n\nOne person dead after two-car crash near Lake Tekapo\n\nAuckland Covid-19 case runs B&B, but guests hear nothing from health officials\n\nNeighbourly\n\nDeath Notices\n\nCoupons\n\nAdvertising\n\nCareers\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nEditorial Code\n\nContact Us\n\nBreaking news?\n\nSend your photos, videos and tip-offs to\n\nnewstips@stuff.co.nz\n\n, or call us on 0800 697 8833\n\n\u00a9\n\n2020\n\nStuff Limited\n", "date": "2020-07-23", "label": true, "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/opinion/300062958/uighur-muslims-need-nzs-support-as-brutal-chinese-clampdown-continues"}

Since then it has wasted no time making a mockery of the UN\u2019s commitment to human rights. Not that the UN needs any help in this department. Over the years it has appointed Saudi Arabia to its women\u2019s rights commission, Iran to its disarmament commission and Zimbabwe to its commission on sustainable development.\n\nStill, allowing China to chair the committee appointing an expert on freedom of speech shows the organisation has lost none of its flair for black humour.\u00a0 The experts must investigate arbitrary detention and government-orchestrated disappearances, matters in which no one can deny that China has first-hand experience. One will report on the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, a domain in which China\u2019s expertise in fostering pandemics is unrivalled. But it is in seeking China\u2019s advice on an expert on freedom of speech that the UN shows true comic genius. Having mined George Orwell\u2019s\n\n1984\n\nas a user manual, Beijing has turned to Ray Bradbury\u2019s\n\nFahrenheit 451\n\n\u2014 a novel in which books are outlawed and firemen must burn any they find. With Hong Kong being brought behind the Great Firewall of China, Beijing has been reviewing the territory\u2019s pro-democracy books with a view to banning if not burning them.\n\nChina\u2019s choice of former head of Amnesty International (AI) Irene Khan was inspired. Before Khan arrived at AI, China complained of the organisation\u2019s pro-Western bias. Khan put a stop to that. Shortly after starting in September 2001, she visited Australia, the first head of AI to do so in its 40-year history. She was incensed at the detention of the 530 asylum seekers and declared that Australia was in breach of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the course of her tenure, she castigated Australia for its violation of the human rights of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory through compulsory income management. She lumped Prime Minister John Howard and US President George W. Bush in with Zimbabwe\u2019s President Robert Mugabe and Sudan\u2019s President Omar al-Bashir claiming that all were leaders who thrived on \u2018myopic and cowardly leadership\u2019 using fear to advance their political agenda. She accused Australia and the US of encouraging terrorism and fuelling instability around the world by liberating Iraq from the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. Describing Guantanamo Bay as \u2018the gulag of our times,\u2019 Khan claimed that it was \u2018entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law,\u2019 and that its trials by military commissions made \u2018a mockery of justice and due process.\u2019\n\nKhan was lionised as a hero of the left in Australia and rewarded with the Sydney Peace Prize but as John Podhoretz wrote in the\n\nNew York Post\n\n, \u2018Maybe the people who work at Amnesty International really do think that the imprisonment of 600 certain or suspected terrorists is tantamount to the imprisonment of 25 million slaves,\u2019 but if so, it \u2018proves that well-meaning people can make morality their life\u2019s work and still be little more than moral idiots.\u2019\n\nYet Khan\u2019s key achievement at AI was to shift the organisation\u2019s focus away from freedom of speech which, she said, meant nothing to a man who can\u2019t read the newspaper and focus on poverty as a human rights violation, a principle that she vigorously defended when negotiating her severance package from Amnesty. Her total pay-out was well over $A1 million dollars, about 4 per cent of its budget for the year and about five years\u2019 funding for one section in Latin America. An independent investigation found that she had negotiated little luxuries like a trebling of her household allowance and a payment to compensate her for her UK tax liabilities on the settlement which the report found to be \u2018wholly inappropriate.\u2019 Conservative MP Phillip Davies commented, \u2018I am sure people making donations to Amnesty, in the belief they are alleviating poverty, never dreamed they were subsidising a fat cat pay-out.\u2019\n\nAfter her golden handshake Khan hopped back on the international human rights money-go-round with an appointment in 2011 to head the International Development Law Organisation (IDLO). Here, despite, her lopsided attacks on the US, IDLO was awarded almost $US 50 million to run a Justice Training Transition Program. One critic summed up its achievements as renting one of the largest NGO offices in Kabul. During her time at IDLO, Khan was a frequent visitor to China and had nothing but praise for its Belt and Road Initiative, which, she said, is \u2018anchored in the purposes and principles of the UN.\u2019 In her many speeches, there was no mention of the arbitrary detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims.\n\nDo Uighur Lives Matter? Not to the 53 countries at the Human Rights Council who supported China\u2019s new national security law in Hong Kong in a vote this month, including a multitude of Muslim nations and the Palestinian Territories, who had nothing to say about the persecution of their co-religionists. Why so shtum? Most have signed onto China\u2019s BRI and many are renegotiating debt payments. Only 27 countries supported the UK in condemning the new law. They didn\u2019t include the US which withdrew from the Council in 2018, with its Ambassador Nikki Haley dismissing it as \u2018a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.\u2019 Many who agree with Haley argue that the US can do more from within, yet it is the US that is doing more than any other nation to pressure China to stop persecuting the Uighur people. This week it added another 11 companies to its list of 37 with restricted access due to violations related to Xinjiang and it has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for aiding in human rights abuses.\n\nIn this, the US is not alone. Following Australia\u2019s lead, Britain has joined the other Five Eyes nations in banning Huawei. Japan and South Korea are diversifying their supply chains away from China. India is retaliating economically to Chinese border aggression. Beijing\u2019s belligerence in the South China Sea has alienated the ASEAN nations. President Xi Jinping wouldn\u2019t admit it, but his indiscriminate aggression has been a mistake and he looks increasingly like North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il, in the 2006 satire,\n\nTeam America\n\npathetically \u2018ronery.\u2019 Yet not at the UN. Khan\u2019s appointment is just another step on China\u2019s \u2018Long March\u2019 to reshape the organisation in its own image. Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the second Secretary-General of the UN said it was created \u2018not to lead mankind to heaven but to save humanity from hell.\u2019 That is an inferno that Beijing, with the acquiescence of the UN\u2019s human rights mandarins, is doing its best to give Chinese characteristics.\n\nGot something to add?

They kept the Muslim prisoners so thirsty that many of them\u00a0were forced to\u00a0drink contaminated water from the industrial warehouses in which they were\u00a0detained.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBBC pushes Chinese ambassador to explain Xinjiang footage of blindfolded prisoners\n\nA million people are jailed at China's gulags.

That led to a kneejerk British Muslim rejection of coordinating action with\u00a0British Jewish communities.\u00a0British Muslim communities worked in their own silos to\u00a0assist Bosnia\u2019s Muslims, whether through\u00a0delivering provisions and food through aid convoys, financially supporting Bosnian units and,\u00a0in some instances, actually fighting with\u00a0them.\n\nSuch distinct and separate activism,\u00a0avoiding\u00a0co-operation and partnership with British Jews,\u00a0was partly driven by\u00a0a belief that\u00a0British Jews were\u00a0collectively\u00a0responsible for the actions of the\u00a0State of Israel. Today,\u00a0we would call that antisemitism,\u00a0though even at the height of the Intifada, I truly believe that antisemitism\u00a0did not capture how\u00a0most British Muslims saw British Jews. It was\u00a0more\u00a0a mixture of awe, anger, mistrust and,\u00a0for\u00a0some,\u00a0the\u00a0antisemitic\u00a0trope of all-encompassing \"Jewish power.\"\n\nThat was also a period when the scope and influence of\u00a0energetic Islamist groups, dedicated to whipping up a frenzy against Jews and the West,\u00a0were cresting with\u00a0unfettered access to Muslim groups, especially students \u2013 and they were exploiting genuine anger about\u00a0the Intifada\u00a0as bait to gather new recruits.\n\nWith the\u00a0the human rights abuses against the Uighurs\u00a0finally coming to the foreground of the UK\n\npolitical agenda\n\nas part of a wider\n\nreset of relations\n\nbetween Britain and\u00a0totalitarian\u00a0China, that\u00a0momentum\u00a0has still not been resolved the tensions and grievances between\u00a0British Muslims and Jews. They again threaten an obvious\u00a0human rights-based partnership.This time, it\u2019s also about Israel-Palestine \u2013 and also about a repackaged kind of Islamism, and an astounding inability to prioritize lives over mere noise.\n\nA\u00a0Uighur activist told me\u00a0recently\u00a0that\u00a0on approaching several\u00a0Muslim groups, the\u00a0the message was clear:\u00a0they would not engage with any activist who had won support from \"Jewish groups who\u00a0back\u00a0Israel.\" In fact, it had been Jewish human rights groups who had aided the Uyghur activist. So much for\u00a0any\n\nentente cordiale\n\naround interfaith relations.\n\nParts of the UK Muslim community have indeed made their voices heard\u00a0against the genocidal desires of the Chinese Communist Party. This week has seen a concerted effort to galvanize online awareness and support by figures such as MP\u00a0Nusrat Ghani,\u00a0broadcaster\n\nMaajid Nawaz\n\n, academic\u00a0Azeem Ibrahim and Ghanem Nuseibeh \u2013 the\u00a0Chair of\n\nMuslims Against Antisemitism\n\n.\n\nBut there\u2019s been a considerable degree of silence, too, and it\u2019s emanating, ironically, from those self-appointed guardians of the UK Muslim community who have led a no-holds-barred campaign against any expression of what they consider to be Islamophobia. They are even campaigning against the UK police using the term \"Islamist\" to describe radical terrorists, on the grounds that it is\n\ndiscriminatory\n\n.\n\nYet, these very groups have\u00a0met the\u00a0hundreds of tweets for support for the Uighurs by Ghani, Nawaz and others with complete indifference. Is attempted genocide not Islamophobic, too? Are the\u00a0Uighurs\u00a0not worthy of their compassion and solidarity\u00a0because the 'wrong kind' of Muslims\u00a0(UK Muslims who don\u2019t boycott UK Jews\n\nen masse\n\nfor their \"guilt\" on Palestine, or\u00a0progressive and secular Muslims who\u00a0dare\u00a0to challenge Islamist narratives)\u00a0are campaigning for their rights?\n\nskip\n                            - Roshan Salih tweet\n\nVery concerning that Uyghur cause is being hijacked by Western states & pro Israel/Islamophobic civil society orgs. The same happenned in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya & Syria and look what happened there. These ppl don't care about Uyghurs, they're just on an anti China crusade\n\n\u2014 Roshan M Salih (@RmSalih)\n\nJuly 20, 2020\n\nAs the Uighurs\u00a0suffer\u00a0in concentration camps,\u00a0Uighur\u00a0women forced into sterilization to wipe out the Uighur\u00a0future, some British Muslim groups are too busy stamping their feet about who\u00a0exactly\u00a0leads campaigns for other Muslims, and refuse to amplify their campaigns. Once again, it\u00a0is clear that Jewish communities have squarely backed the UK Muslim campaigners who have fearlessly and tirelessly stood up for what is right.\n\nBlinded by their own misgivings\u00a0or perhaps prejudices, these self-appointed Muslim \"leaders\" aren\u2019t\u00a0standing\u00a0up for the weak and the dispossessed. They are in love with performative Islamist gestures such as President Erdogan\u2019s\n\nconversion of the Hagia Sophia\n\ninto a mosque, but they\u2019re out of love with basic solidarity for Muslims in fear of their lives.\n\nskip\n                            - Ammar Kazmi tweet\n\nAm I to link arms with some of the most virulent and notoriously Islamophobic politicians in the world because\u2014now that it suits their clandestine foreign policy goals\u2014they\u2019re pretending to care about Muslims? I won\u2019t do that, I\u2019m afraid.\n\n9/10\n\n\u2014 Ammar Kazmi \ud83d\udd3b (@AmmarKazmi_)\n\nJuly 20, 2020\n\nSadly, they have company in the wider Muslim world. Thanks to China\u2019s military and political might, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has declared that\n\nPalestine supports\n\n\"China's legitimate stance on issues concerning its core interests like Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia, where Muhammad was born and died, signed a letter praising China's \"remarkable achievements in the\n\nfield of human rights\n\n\"\u00a0and describing its actions in Xianjiang as \"de-radicalization measures\" including the establishment of \"vocational education and training centers.\" Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the\u00a0UAE, Algeria and other Muslim-majority states\n\nblocked a UN motion\n\ncalling for China to allow \"independent international observers\" into Xinjiang.\n\nAs Guardian columnist Nick Cohen notes, \"They use the idea of Muslim solidarity only\n\nwhen it suits them\n\n.\"\n\nDrone footage of shaven-headed, shackled and blindfolded Uighurs detainees sitting on the ground before being transported on trains to a detention camp in Xinjiang province, China\n\nTwitter\n\nMost British Muslims clearly abhor China\u2019s abuse of the Uighurs. But too many have bought\u00a0into conspiracy theories (such as the Uighur issue as a deliberate exaggeration by Donald Trump and Boris Johnson to deflect from their own bigoted politics), or are following the lead of significant Muslim world leaders who are firmly part of the China denialist camp, or see Jewish community involvement in the protests and consider it a false performance or Zionist entrapment.\n\nThe result is that key grassroots campaigns for Uigur rights, led by Muslims, can\u2019t gain traction within British Muslim communities.\n\nDefending Muslims\u2019 basic human rights\u00a0\u2013 from Bosnia to Xianjiang \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be a selective endeavor for anyone, and certainly not for Muslims ourselves. Perhaps those Muslims who deny, appease or ignore the suffering of the Uigurs should engage in some soul-searching of their own.\n\nHistory only remembers those who stood up at the right time and right place. It never forgives those who stood in the shadows whilst the innocent died.\n\nFiyaz Mughal OBE is the founder and former director of\n\nFaith Matters\n\n, an organization dedicated to countering extremism in Britain.

The assessment was done to get a first-hand view on the issue which is now getting an increased global spotlight.\n\nThis is a significant development-- since not much public concern has been raised on China's Uighur Muslims in Pakistan, which can be largely controlled. But religious journals have taken note, and this could soon be a problem in conservative Pakistan.\n\nAlso read\n\nChina harvesting organs from minorities, including Uighur Muslims: Activists tell UN\n\nThe main objective of the Pakistani assessment was to manage the reaction and also control any overt activity that may cause embarrassment for both Pakistan and China on the Uighur issue.\n\nThe Pakistani government has been silent on the issue with PM Imran Khan shying away from any criticism against 'all-weather' ally China. Earlier this year, when asked about the situation of Uighur Muslims in China, Imran Khan said, \"China has been a great friend, we talk about things privately, not publicly, as these are sensitive issues.\"\n\nAlso read\n\nUS to seek support in calling out China on Uighur issue at UN gathering next week\n\nThe study noted the treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang has especially impacted religious opinion in Pakistan with a number of journals covering the development.\n\nIn one issue of monthly Ishraq from Lahore dated January 2020, a comment by its patron Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, while mentioning about the right to seek refuge, gave an example of 'persecution of Muslims in China.'\n\nAn article in weekly Ahl-E-Hadith from Lahore mentions about state policies of China against its Muslim population and compares it with the severity of Israeli actions against the Palestinians.\n\nDiscussing Xinjiang in the context of atrocities against Muslims globally has been a common pattern among religious journals, the assessment finds.\n\nThe editorial of monthly Mohaddis from Lahore, in the month of February 2020, commented that Muslims in Xinjiang are living a hard life with Muslim majority decreasing from 94 percent in 1948 to 48 percent as they're being 'forced to abandon Islam.'\n\nAnother article in the same monthly on page 24 equated 'national interest considerations' forcing Pakistan to be silent on 'concerns about Muslims in China,' something that also led Islamabad 'to facilitate the US against Afghanistan in 2001.'\n\nIn November 2019, Mohaddis had shared its concerns over restrictions in Xinjiang on Muslims growing beard and this undermining of Islamic symbols becoming the new normal.\n\nThe same issue was raised by monthly Peyam, published from Islamabad in the same month, last year. Al Burhan's article of October 2019, while writing about the issue, highlighted that there are sanctions over fasting in the month of Ramzan.\n\nTwo exclusive articles in two religious journals during the time period of the study done by authorities map detailed the life of the Chinese province.\n\nAl Burhan published a detailed account of Uighur Muslims in three consecutive issues. The account was a personal observation of Pakistani academics about Xinjiang, who described the ground situation as 'technology-based slavery' and called the province a 'police state' with 'every home, street and neighbourhood being a detention centre, every Uighur a suspect and presumed terrorist.'\n\nThe writer pointed out, 'systematic effort to sideline Uighur Muslims and their cultural symbols and gradually bring them to extinction.' He narrated how 'young Uighurs have Chinese spouses and adopted the Chinese way of life.'\n\nThe author, in fact, referred to police presence visible in Capital Urumqi and other parts of Xinjiang. Apart from keeping an eye physically, surveillance is done through a network of security cameras, biometrics and unwanted activity mean swift action including electric shock.\n\nHe also sensed frustration among Uighur Muslims from Pakistan as they expected a word of sympathy from the country.\n\nMohaddis in November 2019 had published an exclusive write up with the title 'Condition of Muslims in Chinese province Xinjiang in the light of international media reports' and stated problems for the Muslim population, which started in 1949.\n\nIt also noted killing of 75000 Muslims by Chinese forces in the province in 1966. The incident started with Chinese authorities trying to stop local Muslims for Eid ul Azha in Kashgar, one of the westernmost cities of the country.\n\nThe article states that copies of the Holy Quran have been forcibly confiscated and around a million minority Muslims have been kept in detention camps. It also cites the Human Rights Watch report which says, every Muslim has to download an official Chinese application in cellphone which allows Chinese authorities to know all the details of the person. A complete record of every Muslim between the age of 12 to 65 has been prepared including their DNA, fingerprints.\n\nSome journals have been raising questions over the silence by Muslim governments, according to the study.\n\nMonthly Tarjuman Ul Quran, from Lahore, published an article in December 2019, titled, \"Attention-seeking issue of Uighur Muslims\" says will Pakistani Muslims respect Chinese territorial integrity, they also feel Uyghur Muslims should be respected and that will help increase China's internal security and send a message of goodwill across the Muslim world. Tarjuman Ul Quran highlighting how Muslim ummah has a geographical unity and includes 'Chinese Turkestan,' the other name of Xinjiang.\n\nWeekly Al Aitisam from Lahore in February 2020, expressed concerns over reports regarding Muslims in Xinjiang and cited BBC reports and viral social media videos.\n\nIt noted complete silence and indifference of Muslim governments over the situation of Uyghur Muslims. September 2019 issue of monthly Uswah Hasana from Karachi made supplication on the occasion of the new Islamic year and sought blessing of God for Muslims living in difficult conditions in areas including in China.\n\nMainstream Pakistani media has been by and large silent on the issue on expected lines, Dawn in its editorial in November 2020 said, \"like many other countries, Pakistan too has a spotty human rights record, but when it can speak out against the human rights violations of the Kashmiris and the Rohingya, can it stay silent about the Uyghurs?\"\n\nThe Pakistani authorities in the assessment found prominent religious leaders have commented on the subject. While they are cautious on the issue, they expect the Pakistani government to raise the concern with the Chinese leadership through diplomatic channels.\n\nOne cleric Rashdi in his column titled \"Rohingya Muslims and the verdict of the international court of justice\" pointed out that Muslim genocide is not confined to Arkan in Myanmar but other parts of the world including Xinjiang.\n\nIn fact, renowned scholar Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani in a tweet on December 28th, 2019 had said, \"News regarding China's Uighur community is very disturbing. The government of Pakistan must confirm this news and reach out to Chinese authorities using its influence to win justice for the Uighurs.\" At a time of collective silence, the tweet does raise the eyebrows for the authorities.\n\n\u0686\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2\n\n#\u0627\u06cc\u063a\u0648\u0631\n\n\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06d2 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u062a\u0634\u0648\u06cc\u0634\u0646\u0627\u06a9 \u062e\u0628\u0631\u06cc\u06ba \u0622\u0631\u06c1\u06cc \u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u062d\u06a9\u0648\u0645\u062a \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u0636 \u06c1\u06d2 \u06a9\u06c1 \u0648\u06c1 \u0627\u0646\u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u062d\u0642\u06cc\u0642 \u06a9\u0631\u06d2 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0686\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0627\u067e\u0646\u06d2 \u0627\u062b\u0631 \u0648\u0631\u0633\u0648\u062e \u06a9\u0648 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u06a9\u0631\u06a9\u06d2 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u0648 \u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0641 \u062f\u0644\u0627\u0626\u06d2 \u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b \u0645\u064a\u06ba \u06c1\u06d2 \u06a9\u06c1 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u0628\u06be\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u06c1\u0648\u062a\u0627 \u06c1\u06d2 \u0648\u06c1 \u06a9\u0633\u06cc \u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0648 \u0628\u06d2 \u06cc\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u062f\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0631 \u0646\u06c1\u06cc\u06ba \u0686\u06be\u0648\u0691\u062a\u0627\n\n\u2014 Muhammad Taqi Usmani (@muftitaqiusmani)\n\nDecember 28, 2019\n\nThe study comes even as the Pakistan government had to face embarrassment over the leaked reports of the Independent power commission that highlighted Chinese companies were charging rates higher than even local Pakistani companies.\n\nThe commission was constituted by Pakistani government to evaluate CPEC power projects and while the report was suppressed locally, it got coverage in international media.\n\nChina\n\nMuslims\n\nChinese Government\n\nPakistan Government\n\nUighur Muslims\n\nHome\n\nIndia\n\nWorld\n\nBusiness\n\nTechnology\n\nSports\n\nEntertainment\n\nFOLLOW US ON\n\nAbout DNA\n\nContact us\n\nInvestors\n\nAdvertise\n\nReprint Rights\n\nPartner Sites\n\nZee News\n\nHindi News\n\nMarathi News\n\nBengali News\n\nTamil News\n\nMalayalam News\n\nZee Business\n\nWION\n\n\u00a92020 Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.\n\n.assemele-nav a.active, .assemele-nav li.active {border-bottom: 0px solid #000;}\n    .assemele-nav li.active a {border-bottom: 3px solid #000;}\n\nfunction getCookie(name)\n  {\n    var re = new RegExp(name + \"=([^;]+)\");\n    var value = re.exec(document.cookie);\n    return (value != null) ? unescape(value[1]) : null;\n  }\n", "date": "2020-07-31", "label": true, "url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-pak-internal-study-finds-religious-journals-raising-uighur-plight-in-china-2835135"}

Both sides agree it can take a toll on bilateral ties especially with religious segments of society become aware and vocal.\n\nShare\n\nWritten By\n\nSidhant Sibal\n\nEdited By\n\nJoydeep Bose\n\nSource\n\nDNA webdesk\n\nUpdated: Aug 1, 2020, 10:49 PM IST\n\nPakistani authorities have handed over to the Chinese mission in Islamabad the internal assessment report done to gauge the public sentiment on atrocities against Uighurs by Chinese govt in the restive western province of Xinjiang.\n\nWhile both sides have deliberated on it, the Chinese mission in Islamabad has asked Pakistani authorities to manage negative sentiments domestically when it comes to atrocities on Uighurs Muslims. Both sides agree it can take a toll on bilateral ties especially with religious segments of society become aware and vocal.\n\nThe report found that religious journals in Pakistan have been talking about it vocally and widely covering the situation in Xinjiang which one journal describing the ground situation as \"technology-based slavery\". The main objective of the Pakistani internal study is to manage the reaction and control any activity that may cause embarrassment for both Pakistan and China on the Uyghur issue.\n\nJournals like Ishraq, Ahl-E-Hadith, Mohaddis, Peyam, Al Burhan, Al Aitisam, Uswah Hasana, and Tarjuman Ul Quran have been discussing the matter since November 2019. The story was first broken by DNA on Friday.\n\nThe Chinese mission has sought more feedback on the matter. The Chinese embassy in Pakistan is worried about the religious sections of Pakistani society, which are considered not only staunch but uncompromising on such developments. It sees the role of mainstream English media such as Dawn who have reported on China's expanding sphere of influence also concerning.\u00a0 While major mainstream media in Pakistan have been focusing on growing cooperation and goodwill between Islamabad and Beijing, \"certain English media\" gives space to disturbing news from China, the mission has discussed with Pakistani authorities.\n\nFeedback on Urdu media has been asked, as religious segments rely on Urdu media for information. When it comes to Urdu media versus English media, the Chinese mission believes the latter caters only to a certain section of the elite and doesn't have a significant role in shaping public opinion.\n\nBoth sides have concurred that \"chances of emotions taking shape\" may increase as western sources give more reportage to the crisis in Xinjiang but with documentary evidence.\u00a0 The Chinese response to western stories on Xinjiang is not seen as convincing and one that is lacking transparency. For example, while initially, China denied that acknowledge the presence of detention centers, Beijing later adjusted its position to pronounce them as re-education and de-radicalization centers.\n\nWhat the Chinese mission seeks to understand is if concerns regarding Xinjiang are taking\u00a0 \"shape of emotions\" and this could be detrimental to the interest of both countries, especially with the mega infrastructure project China Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC passing through the South Asian country.\n\nPeople to people connectivity is another aspect the Chinese mission has asked feedback on as Pakistanis might be forming personal opinions and getting information first hand. One is the frequent visit of people from Pakistan to Urumqi, Kashgar in Xinjiang with some married to Uighur Muslims and concerned about the safety of their families.\u00a0 Another is an increased connection between Pakistani and Turkish nationals at the public and official level and that might get expose the former with Uighur right activities.\u00a0Feedback has also been asked on current questions being raised on the silence of Pakistani nationals over conditions of Uighurs vis a vis being vocal on \"other communities such as in Palestine or Kashmir.\" Pakistani Establishment and Prime Minister Imran Khan have been silent on Uighur issues and when asked have been muted to any criticism against \"all-weather\" ally China.\n\nPakistan\n\nNepal\n\nChina\n\nISLAMABAD\n\nIndia\n\nBeijing\n\nUighur\n\nUighur Muslims\n\nHome\n\nIndia\n\nWorld\n\nBusiness\n\nTechnology\n\nSports\n\nEntertainment\n\nFOLLOW US ON\n\nAbout DNA\n\nContact us\n\nInvestors\n\nAdvertise\n\nReprint Rights\n\nPartner Sites\n\nZee News\n\nHindi News\n\nMarathi News\n\nBengali News\n\nTamil News\n\nMalayalam News\n\nZee Business\n\nWION\n\n\u00a92020 Diligent Media Corporation Ltd.\n\n.assemele-nav a.active, .assemele-nav li.active {border-bottom: 0px solid #000;}\n    .assemele-nav li.active a {border-bottom: 3px solid #000;}\n\nfunction getCookie(name)\n  {\n    var re = new RegExp(name + \"=([^;]+)\");\n    var value = re.exec(document.cookie);\n    return (value != null) ? unescape(value[1]) : null;\n  }\n", "date": "2020-08-01", "label": true, "url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-exclusive-after-pakistan-s-uighur-assessment-report-china-asks-islamabad-to-manage-negative-sentiments-domestically-2835359"}

The primary cause has been that it has been very critical of Chinese influence in Pakistan.\n\nChina needs to come up with Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) in Xinjiang and a \"better understanding of the religion\" will be helpful for Chinese authorities in \"understanding the people's aspirations and concerns\" are the key findings of the internal assessment carried out by Pakistan to understand the mood of the public on the situation of Uighur Muslims in China.\n\nThe internal assessment by Pakistan on public sentiment on the atrocities against Uighurs Muslims carried out by the Chinese government in the restive western province of Xinjiang saw religious Urdu journals being more vocal about it.\n\nThe assessment recommended that \"reliable and mature religious\" leaders need to be kept on frequent communication. And these religious leaders should feel the \"closeness\" in which they may give a suggestion to Chinese authorities on the issue.\n\nBut largely a relook by Chinese authorities of \"governance\" is what is needed--this includes revisiting approach of compulsory and forcible re-education of Uighur Muslims.\n\nAlso read:\n\nAtrocities against Uighurs: China asks Pakistan to manage negative sentiments domestically\n\nWhile Pakistani internal assessment has lauded Chinese leadership in the long term strategy of mainstreaming and integration of people of Xinjiang, the report suggests the common population should not be seen as a collective threat. It hopes fasting, prayers, recitation of Quran should be allowed since these are important tenets of Islam and restrictions over them is a cause discomfort.\n\nThe internal report has recommended that Muslims should be allowed the freedom to perform their rituals which will give a positive message inside and outside of China.\n\nIn fact, the news of curbs and restrictions on the Muslim way of life in other parts of China as well is seen as extremely disturbing for anyone in Pakistan, the report concurs.\n\nIt is important to know, Pakistan has banned online publication of extremist journals Hittin. The primary cause has been that it has been very critical of Chinese influence in Pakistan and Beijing should not be seen as a well-wisher to people of the region.\n\nIt has talked about the mammoth infrastructure project the China Pakistan economic corridor in the same context and highlighted the \"plight of Muslims in East Turkistan\".

These four words sum up Imran Khan's approach towards the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China.\n\nFirst, he would avoid all questions on the topic. Imran Khan feigned complete ignorance about the issue. He said he wasn't aware of what was happening to the Uighurs.\n\nThen, he started bypassing the questions. Imran Khan said he didn't have enough knowledge about the issue. And even if he did -- he would never address it in public. Because the Chinese are apparently 'sensitive people'.\n\nIts been a while and the public sentiment on Uighur persecution in Pakistan is stronger than ever.\n\nSo, Imran Khan is now trying to confuse the world regarding his stance. Instead of directly calling out China for its atrocities. The Pak govt is shooting off the shoulders of its citizens.\n\nIslamabad has come up with an internal assessment report on Uighurs. A report which claims to have found \"seething anger\" against the Chinese regime among Pakistani citizens.\n\nFirst, the findings.\n\nThe study notes that the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang has impacted religious opinion in Pakistan.\n\nSeveral Islamic journals across Pakistan have been publishing commentary critical of the Chinese regime. Some of them have found a mention in this assessment report.\n\nHere are their names: Ishraq, Ahl-e-Hadith (Hadees), Mohaddis, Peyam, Al Burhan, Al Aitisam (Ahtisam), Uswah Hasana, Tarjuman-ul-Quran and many more journals that have been publishing detailed accounts of the situation of Uighurs.\n\nThe articles in these journals describe Xinjiang as a 'police state'. They call the situation in the Chinese province as 'technology-based slavery'. They say Beijing is trying to enforce the 'chinese way of life' on the Uighurs. And that it is trying to 'systematically bring the uighurs to extinction'.\n\nAnd the stories they carry let me tell you are quite detailed. They come with facts and figures on the diminishing population of Uighurs. They talk about the presence of Chinese officials in Uighur homes.\n\nThey cite speeches of religious leaders slamming china and centre and they raise questions over the silence of the Pakistan government.\n\nTo add to that, the stories these journals carry are published in Urdu. The national language of Pakistan. Naturally, the reach and impact of these journals cannot be downplayed.\n\nIslamabad is aware of this reality. Imran khan enjoys huge popularity among orthodox Muslims in Pakistan. He cannot afford to maintain absolute silence on the Uighurs.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nSo, this internal assessment report is Pakistan's attempt at controlling the narrative before it gets too late. So it has conveyed these concerns to China.\n\nIt has handed this assessment report to the Chinese mission in Islamabad with some recommendations.\n\nHere are Pak's suggestions to China:\n\nOne,\n\nPakistan has advised China to come up with 'confidence building measures' in Xinjiang.\n\nTwo,\n\nIslamabad has asked Beijing to get a 'better understanding of the religion'.\n\nThree,\n\nIt has asked china to communicate through 'reliable and mature religious leaders'.\n\nAnd four,\n\nIt has advised china to not see the 'common population of xinjiang as a collective threat'.\n\nSurprisingly, the Chinese regime has responded to these recommendations. But the reaction is not what Pakistan may have expected.\n\n'Manage negative sentiments domestically'\n\nThis is the message that has been sent out by the Chinese mission in Islamabad to the Pak govt.\n\nChina said that Pakistan's concerns on Uighurs are 'taking the shape of emotions'.\n\nEmotions that could be detrimental to the interest of both countries.

The state is 1.5 times the size of Pakistan and 12 times more than Bangladesh, and it also borders eight countries, including India, along with 5 other nations where Islam is the largest religion.\n\nMuslims here, known as Uighur Muslims, are not allowed to grow their beards or observe fast in the month of Ramadan, women are not allowed to wear a burqa, and they cannot celebrate their religious festivals. The DNA report will reveal several other facts in today's analysis and will also let you know why Islamic countries maintain a strategic silence against these atrocities while they have waged a war in other parts of the world in the name of Muslim brotherhood.\n\nUighur Muslims in Xinjiang province, comprising 50 percent of the population, are considered to be from eastern Turkistan. Till 1949, 90 percent of the population here was from Turkish origin while descendants of the Han dynasty were less than 4 percent. In the ongoing genocide for the last 70 years, the population of Turkish Uighur Muslims is now reduced to 55 percent while Han Chinese people have increased to 45 percent.\n\nChina has not only targeted the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, but it has also kept 3 million Muslims of Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Turkish descent in different concentration camps. Islamic community across the world has not opened its mouth against this atrocity in China while they were enraged over cartoons on Prophet Mohammed published in a Paris newspaper Charlie Hebdo and they attacked the newspaper's office in 2015 for insulting Islam.\n\nMuslims of Xinjiang have been continuously saying that they are a free nation, but China has crushed their voice. The people of East Turkistan are also struggling for the last long time, but China has trampled all the protests, as it is now suppressing the voice of democracy in Hong Kong, or had suppressed Tibet.\n\nChina had demolished mosques in Xinjiang as it wants to destroy the identity of Muslims living there. Out of about 20 million Muslims living in China, 10 million are Uighur Muslims. According to reports, so far 18 lakh Uighur Muslims have been imprisoned in China, 10 lakh Muslims have been kept in more than 1000 concentration camps, which are called re-education camps.\n\nIn these camps, Uighur Muslims undergo all kinds of atrocities and their organs are reportedly smuggled. Muslim women are also raped, men are forced into sterilization, and children are separated from their parents.\n\nIn the last three years, 10 to 15 thousand mosques have been demolished in Xinjiang province, according to the Uighur Human Rights project report. But Muslims across the world, including India, have failed to raise voice against atrocities on Uighur Muslims of China.\n\nMany people in India protested when a new law on citizenship law was passed, and recently people belonging to the Muslim community resorted to violent protests in Bengaluru to express their anger against a Facebook post on Prophet Mohammed.\n\nIn the year 2017-2018, when Rohingya Muslims were expelled from Myanmar, it was criticized all over the world, but on the question of atrocities on Muslims in China, even the United Nations avoided the criticism of China.\n\nMuslims in China apparently cannot raise their voices, but countries that have raised the banner of Islam are also silent on this matter. Saudi Arabia, which considers itself to be the leader of Islamic countries, has never spoken on this issue.\n\nTurkey, which wants to replace Saudi Arabia in the Islamic world, has rather preferred to send Uighur Muslims to China if they land upon its territory. Pakistan also avoids the issue of Uighur Muslims and maintains a stoic silence. Malaysia, which vociferously raises Kashmir issue along with Pakistan on global forums, has never flayed China stating that China never responds to criticism.\n\nOn the other hand, Iran has stated that China is rather serving Islam by suppressing the voice of these Muslims.\n\nNotably, 24% of the world's population, 180 crores, resides in 50 countries where Islam is the largest religion, while believers in Christianity are 250 crores. Islam, therefore, is the second-largest religion after Christianity, but 180 million Muslims never speak against China.\n\nThe reasons are obvious: Most of the Islamic countries are afraid of China, which has virtually bought many of these nations through it monetary power. China has invested Rs 4.47 lakh crore in Pakistan. In 2017, China had signed a deal of Rs 5.20 lakh crore with Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.\n\nSimilarly, China is likely to invest Rs 29 lakh crore in Iran, while Malaysia's 45 percent of the total foreign direct investment (FDI) is from China. Not only this, China has also saved the sinking economy of Turkey. China is also the top nation to import oil from Gulf countries, and this primarily is the key reason behind the silence of these countries.\n\nAmong the nations that have agreed to be part of China's One Belt One Road project, 30 are Islamic countries.\n\nRead More\n\nMicrosoft may earn an Affiliate Commission if you purchase something through recommended links in this article\n\nTOPICS FOR YOU\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nAd\n\nMicrosoft\n\n#KeepAWatch on your Vitals In Real Time with GOQii\n\nGOQii\n\nPower new possibilities\n\nDell\n\nElectronics and accessories at amazing discounts.

order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by\n\nHuman Rights\n\nWatch (HRW).\n\nThe development comes as part of a\n\nmass security crackdown\n\non minorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said, which includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and \u201cforced political indoctrination\u201d.\n\nOfficials reportedly scan the \u201csmart\u201d doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.\n\nRead more\n\nInside China\u2019s

detained\n\nSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: \u201cThe Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.\n\n\u201cThe campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.\u201d\n\nAuthorities claim the codes \u2013 which in some locales feature on every home \u2013 help with population control and delivery of services.\n\n\u201cStarting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there\u2019s a QR code,\u201d one former resident who left\n\nXinjiang\n\n, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\n\n\u201cThen every two days, or every day, the cadres come and scan the QR code, so they know how many people live here \u2013 and starting around then, they would ask [our] visitors, \u2018Why are you here?\u2019 In the evenings the cadres would check as well.\u201d\n\nFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards, or during police interrogations.\n\nChina demolishes mosque, prompting rare protest against government\n\n\u201cThey did take our DNA samples and iris scans when we applied for the passports,\u201d a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. \u201cFor those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, \u2018You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you\u2019.

guard at the site of an attack at the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi on June 29.\n\n    \u00a0 \u00a9             Reuters\n\nADNAN AAMIR, Contributing writer\n\nAugust 1, 2020 17:19 JST\n\n|\n\nPakistan\n\nCopy\n\nCopied\n\nKARACHI -- Baloch and Sindhi separatist groups in Pakistan have announced they are forming an alliance aimed ostensibly at attacking Chinese interests in a development likely increase security costs for Belt and Road Initiative projects in Pakistan.\n\nOn July 25, Baloch Raji Ajoi Sangar, or BRAS, a consortium of four Baloch separatist organizations, announced in a media release an alliance with the Sindudesh Revolutionary Army, or SRA, a little known separatist group operating in southeastern Sindh province. Balochistan is another province in the southwest.\n\n\"Sindh and Balochistan are equally affected by the 'expansionist' and 'oppressive' resolves of China,\" the statement said. \"Through the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), China aims to subjugate Sindh and Balochistan and occupy the coasts and resources from Badin to Gwadar,\" the statement added, referring to a pair of coastal cities.\n\nThe CPEC consists of a variety of infrastructure projects under China's Belt and Road Initiative with financial help from Beijing. Pakistan and China, which both have tense relations with India, have been allies for decades.\n\nBaloch insurgents claimed that an attack on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in June was carried out with support from Sindhi separatists. Security officials told local media that with the alliance Sindhi insurgents can now launch deadlier attacks with the help of Baloch militants.\n\nMembers of the Crime Scene Unit of the Karachi Police prepare to survey the site of the attack at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\n\n    \u00a0 \u00a9             Reuters\n\nExperts believe that while the alliance can create problems for the CPEC, it cannot halt the flagship project of President Xi Jinping's trademark program. \"An alliance between the Baloch and Sindhi armed groups cannot be so effective that it will compel China and Pakistan to completely withdraw from [CPEC] plans,\" said Malik Siraj Akbar, a South Asian analyst based in Washington D.C.\n\nHowever, analysts also think that the grouping will significantly increase security costs for CPEC activities.\n\n\"As China doubles down on the CPEC infrastructure projects from Kashmir to Karachi and Gwadar, the insurgent forces will seek to raise the costs by launching attacks and raids,\" Mohan Malik, a professor of strategic studies at the National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates, told the Nikkei Asian Review.\n\nIn May 2019, the Baloch Liberation Army, a BRAS constituent, attacked the Pearl Continental Hotel in Gwadar, the port city's only five star hotel, and killed five people including four hotel employees. Though no Chinese were killed, the BLA said in a statement that the attack was planned with the intent of targeting Chinese, who often stayed in the hotel.\n\nAkbar, meanwhile, sees the government's expected moves to beef up security in response to more attacks as playing into the hands of the new alliance.\n\n\"An increase in violent attacks will require reevaluating the security plans and timelines for the completion of certain parts of CPEC,\" he told Nikkei. \"The more the government increases security [for CPEC projects], the more it gives the nationalists a reason to tell the local population that these are exploitative projects aimed to take their resources away.\"\n\nA ship carrying containers is\u00a0seen during the opening of a trade project in Pakistan's Gwadar port, west of Karachi, in\u00a0November\u00a02016.\n\n    \u00a0 \u00a9             Getty Images\n\nPakistan has blamed India for supporting Baloch and Sindhi insurgents to target Chinese interests in the country. Prime Minister Imran Khan in June blamed India for the attack on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which has a major Chinese stake. New Delhi denied Khan's claim.\n\nExperts also link the new alliance to the recent India-China military standoff in the Himalayas. Malik believes that an escalation in separatist violence and proxy wars on the subcontinent will be an inevitable consequence of New Delhi-Beijing security tensions. \"[India and China] will engage in an intense geopolitical competition to win over the allegiance of countries and [separatist movements] hostile to the other.\"\n\nOther experts see a relationship between the forming of the new alliance and phenomenon of resistance by local communities to China's growing role.\n\n\"As China's global footprint extends and Chinese economic activities directly impact, sometimes adversely, local communities, the pushback is inevitable,\" said Dibyesh Anand, head of the School of Social Sciences at the University of Westminster, London\n\nChinese\u00a0President Xi Jinping, right, shakes hands with Pakistani\u00a0Prime Minister Imran Khan before a meeting at the Great Hall of the People on April 28, 2019 in Beijing.\n\n    \u00a0 \u00a9             Getty Images\n\nAnand cautioned, however, that the threat posed by the Baloch-Sindhi separatist alliance to Chinese interests should not be blown out of proportion. \"The claims of Baloch and Sindhi nationalists [to attack the CPEC] should be taken with a pinch of salt because the economic might of China is closely tied in with [the] security-military might of the Pakistani state and separatists cannot match that,\" he told Nikkei.\n\nExperts also see the formation of the new alliance as a factor that can push Pakistan and China to make CPEC more inclusive. Akbar believes that the two countries might also start considering employing more locals in CPEC projects in an effort to gain support from communities by giving them an economic stake in the projects.\n\nAnand said that Pakistan must for now wait and watch. \"Whether CPEC can be turned into an engine for inclusive development rather than a highly visible security-economic prestige project perceived by many Baloch or Sindhi separatists as neocolonial, is an open question,\" he said.\n\nStay ahead with our exclusives on Asia\n\nSign up to our newsletters to get our best stories delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nCopy\n\nCopied\n\nRead Next\n\nBelt and Road\n\nPakistan bans political party critical of China's Belt and Road\n\nBelt and Road\n\nChina-Iran deal overshadows Pakistan Belt and Road project\n\nBelt and Road\n\nGunmen opposing 'Belt and Road' attack Pakistan bourse; 8 dead\n\nBelt and Road\n\nPakistan benefits from China-India clash with hydropower deal\n\nCoronavirus\n\nConspiracy theories help coronavirus take root in Pakistan\n\nCoronavirus\n\nBangladesh fears loss of trust amid fake coronavirus test scandal\n\nInternational relations\n\nChina poised for diplomatic windfall in Sri Lanka elections\n\nInternational relations\n\nNepal broadcasters block Indian news over 'insulting' propaganda\n\nInternational relations\n\nSri Lanka's India ties strained as Rajapaksa rethinks port deal\n\nInternational relations\n\nKashmiris see ray of hope in India-China standoff in Himalayas\n\nSponsored Content\n\nAbout Sponsored Content\n\nThis content was commissioned by Nikkei's Global Business Bureau.\n\nDiscover the all new\n\nNikkei Asia app\n\nGet Insights on Asia in your inbox\n\nSign Up\n\nConnect With Us\n\nDiscover the all new\n\nNikkei Asia app\n\nConnect With Us\n\nAbout us\n\nContact us\n\nSitemap\n\nHelp\n\nTerms of use\n\nCopyright\n\nPrivacy & cookie policy\n\nAdvertising\n\nNikkei Inc.

Gen Bajwa had to settle for a meeting with the\n\nDeputy Defence Minister Sheikh Khalid Bin Salman\n\n, also the younger brother of the Crown Prince, as well as Maj Gen Fayyad Al Ruwaili, the kingdom\u2019s chief of general staff, people familiar with the matter in Riyadh and New Delhi.\n\nBajwa is learnt to have conveyed the Imran Khan government\u2019s apology over\n\nforeign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi\u2019s statement\n\nthat criticised Saudi Arabia over the reluctance of the Organisation of Islamic Countries to convene a meeting of OIC foreign ministers to discuss Kashmir.\n\nBut the regret conveyed to Deputy Defence Minister Sheikh Khalid Bin Salman during their meeting on Tuesday, didn\u2019t get Islamabad any further in Riyadh. General Bajwa\u2019s interactions in the kingdom were limited to Saudi\u2019s defence establishment,\n\njust as Pakistan military had claimed\n\nafter news of General Bajwa\u2019s trip was leaked back home.\n\nThis version was, however, contradicted by Pakistan minister Sheikh Rasheed on Saturday who told a news channel that the army chief was visiting Saudi Arabia to iron out outstanding minor differences\n\nGeneral Bajwa is accompanied on this visit by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt General Faiz Hameed.\n\nThere has been a buzz in Islamabad that\n\nPM Khan was not averse to dropping Qureshi\n\n, who crossed the red line with Saudi Arabia when he threatened to call a conference of Islamic countries outside the OIC if it did not call a conference of foreign ministers to discuss the situation in Kashmir.\n\nPakistan has long pressed the Saudi-led OIC to convene a high-level meeting to highlight alleged Indian violations in the part it controls but hasn\u2019t got its way so far.\n\n\u201cIf you (OIC) cannot convene it, then I\u2019ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told local media last week.\n\nAn Indian diplomat said after India cemented its ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries over the last six years, Pakistan had distanced itself from its projected Arab legacy and moved towards Erdogan\u2019s Ottoman revival. Turkey\u2019s position on Kashmir mirrors Pakistan\u2019s stand.\n\nAt his meeting in Riyadh, Gen Bajwa is also learnt to have floated a proposal for a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) contact group on Kashmir on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting to be held under Turkey. The OIC contact group on Kashmir, formed in 1994, is a smaller group of OIC foreign ministers.\n\nIt has already met on June 22 this year to discuss Kashmir when foreign ministers of Azerbaijan, Niger, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey attended the meeting. A diplomat in Delhi said the proposal appeared to be a face-saver for Imran Khan vis-a-vis his Pakistan\u2019s domestic audience.\n\nImran Khan hasn\u2019t commented on Qureshi\u2019s statement so far but over the last one week, there has been an effort to distance PM Khan from Qureshi. Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari was the face of this effort when she publicly criticised the country\u2019s foreign affairs ministry by saying that it had let down both the Kashmiris and PM Khan. The criticism was a sharp contrast to PM Khan telling the National Assembly just weeks earlier that Pakistan\u2019s foreign policy, mostly directed at Kashmir, was the biggest achievement of his government.\n\ntags\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nPakistan\n\nImran Khan\n\nGeneral Qamar Bajwa\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscribe\n\nThank you for subscribing to our daily newsletter.\n\ntop news\n\nFATF dashes Pak hopes of getting out of grey list, then a harsh rebuke\n\nFor Donald Trump, India-US ties are about photo-ops, says Joe Biden\n\nCSK vs MI, IPL 2020 Live: Ishan\u2019s fifty give full control to MI\n\nPunjab CM\u2019s son summoned by ED in illegal foreign funds case\n\nBharat Biotech\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine gets nod for Phase 3 trial.

Asim Saleem Bajwa (retd), chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan, is gathering a storm in his country.\n\nOn Friday, the\n\nwebsite of the Pakistan Remittance Initiative\n\nwas hacked, and a picture of Bajwa and his family was put up, calling for accountability. This came a day after a\n\nPakistani media report\n\nhad elaborated the \u201csuspicious\u201d financial dealings of Bajwa\u2019s family, worth millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cThe growth of the Bajwa family\u2019s business empire in the United States and later in Pakistan directly matches the rise in power of retired general Asim Saleem Bajwa, who is now chairman of the country\u2019s massive China-financed infrastructure project and a special assistant to the prime minister,\u201d the report, penned by journalist Ahmed Noorani and published on\n\nFact Focus,\n\nstated.\n\nBajwa is a former director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistani military, and was\n\nappointed as special assistant\n\nto PM Khan on information in April this year.\n\nFollowing the publication of the report, Asim Bajwa denied the allegations on Twitter, saying: \u201cA malicious propaganda story published on an unknown site, against me and my family, is strongly rebutted.\u201d\n\nA malicious propaganda story published on an unknown site,  against me and my family, (just uploaded on social media)is strongly rebutted\n\n\u2014 Asim Saleem Bajwa (@AsimSBajwa)\n\nAugust 27, 2020\n\nAlso read:\n\nPakistan to seek deposits from citizens overseas to boost foreign exchange reserves\n\nBajwa\u2019s declared assets versus report\u2019s claims\n\nIn his declaration of assets and liabilities signed in June as special assistant to the PM, Bajwa declared an investment of $18,468 (Pakistani rupees 31 lakh) in his wife\u2019s name. He also declared that he and his wife have no immovable property held outside Pakistan, or any business capital outside Pakistan.\n\nHowever, the report traces the Bajwa family\u2019s business dealings as far back as 2002, saying that was the year his younger brothers opened their first Papa John\u2019s pizza outlet. This was the year Bajwa went to work for Gen. Pervez Musharraf, as a lieutenant colonel on the military dictator\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cNadeem Bajwa, 53, who started as a\u00a0delivery driver\u00a0for the pizza restaurant franchise, his brothers and Asim Bajwa\u2019s wife and sons now own a business empire which set up 99 companies in four countries, including a pizza franchise with 133 restaurants worth an estimated $39.9 million,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cOut of total 99 companies, 66 are main companies, 33 companies are branch companies of some of the main companies, while five companies are dead now,\u201d it alleged, adding that the businesses of the Bajwa family have been put under the umbrella called Bajco Group.\n\nBajwa\u2019s sons joined Bajco Group companies in 2015, and also started establishing new companies independent of the Bajco Group in Pakistan and in the US after he became director general of ISPR and commander of the country\u2019s Southern Command.\n\nThe report also alleged that Lt Gen. Bajwa\u2019s wife Farrukh Zeba was a shareholder in all the foreign businesses from the very beginning. She is currently associated with or is a shareholder in 85 companies, including 82 abroad (71 in the US, seven in the UAE and four in Canada).\n\nThe report added that records from US state governments and other records related to the companies showed that some of them also have investments in the real estate sector and own some 13 commercial properties in the United States, including two shopping centres.\n\n\u201cEstimated current net worth of businesses and properties of these companies jointly owned by Farrukh Zeba stands at $52.7 million,\u201d the report said.\n\nAlso read:\n\nPakistanis know a lot about Dawood Ibrahim.

How did they kill him with so much brutality in front of his mother? Why didn't anybody intervene?  Why didn't anybody ask anything? You run your houses with our money and resources and then kill our sons and daughters\".\n\nSocial media has been simmering with anti-\n\nPakistan\n\nposts and videos. The calls made by local leaders to come out in large numbers have resonated with the masses and they have provided a massive strength to the movement.\n\nA criminal silence from Islamabad has only validated the accusations.\n\nData collected from different local and international agencies confirm Baloch plights and charges. They say over 53,000 Balochs have disappeared till date and the establishment is not sparing even the women and children.\n\nThe protestor also said that authorities have adopted new tricks to execute extrajudicial killings, label them as rebels working against the interest of the country.\n\nHakeem Baloch\n\n, President of Baloch National Movement (UK Zone) told ANI, \"This wasn't an isolated murder or only case of\n\nHayat Baloch\n\n, there have been many incidents where\n\nPakistan\n\ni forces have killed Baloch youths and they were labeled as members of Baloch armed groups but in reality, they were just innocent, non-combatant civilians who were killed by the\n\nPakistan\n\ni forces\".\n\nIt is not just the state forces, but the establishment has been using mercenaries, also known as 'death squads' to carry out genocide in the region.\n\nOnly a few weeks back, the Brahmsh Baloch episode had shaken the conscience of humanity, and now this Brutal Hayat's killing,\n\nBalochistan\n\nis literally turning into a human graveyard.\n\nAnd despite incriminating evidence, repeated pleas, the international community has taken little notice with its actions restricted to condemnations. Balochs demand more.\n\nKarima Baloch, former Chairperson of Baloch Students Organisation-Azad and a Karima Baloch said, \"Its pity that international powers have been selective when it comes to human rights. They fail to acknowledge that there is a systematic and slow genocide going on in\n\nBalochistan\n\n. But we will keep on reminding them that human rights violations in one part of the world are not isolated events but they will have long term implications\".\n\nPakistan\n\nhas been obliging to Chinese instructions, which has made a multi-billion dollar investment in the region, and now both Beijing and Islamabad are in cahoots in Baloch depredation and elimination.

PHOTO: FO/File\n\nISLAMABAD:\n\nThe Foreign Office (FO) observed on Thursday that India cannot wash away the truth about Kashmir through peddling fake news and running its propaganda machinery faster.\n\nDuring the weekly press briefing, FO Spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said that today (July 3) marks the 332nd day of the continued brutalisation of innocent people of the Indian-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOKJ) - images of which were flashed across the world yesterday, depicting the level of callousness and inhumanity meted out by the Indian occupation forces.\n\n\u201cThe heart-wrenching picture of the three-year-old boy in Sopore will forever remain seared in the imagination of all those who believe in humanity, human rights and fundamental freedoms,\u201d the spokesperson stated.\n\n'1,546 ceasefire violations'\n\nShe further maintained that ceasefire violations by Indian security forces continue unabated on the Line of Control (LOC).\n\n\u201cAs a result of recent violations and mortar and artillery shelling on the LoC in Kayani and Jura sectors of the LoC, on 29th and 30th June 2020, 16-year-old Muhammad Tauheed resident of Talwari village embraced shahadat; and two-yea- old Azad Ahmed, six-year-old Aneesa Waqas, 28- year-old Siraj Din, son of Nizam Din, 16-year-old Sarmad Akram and 42-year-old Abdul Qayyum sustained serious injuries.\u201d\n\nShe added that in the first six months of 2020, 1,546 ceasefire violations have occurred, resulting in the martyrdom of 14 and serious injuries to 114 innocent civilians.\n\n'Kashmir domiciles'\n\nFarooqui added that Pakistan had categorically rejected the grant of domicile certificates in IOJ&K by the Indian authorities to reportedly 25,000 Indian nationals.\n\n\u201cThe Kashmiri people have also rejected the bogus domicile certificates,\u201d she said, \u201cThe certificates issued to non-Kashmiris including, among others, Indian government officials under the \u201cJammu and Kashmir Grant of Domicile Certificate (Procedure), 2020\u201d are illegal, void and in complete violation of the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and international law including the 4th Geneva Convention.\u201d\n\nShe furhter maintained that the latest action is a vindication of Pakistan\u2019s consistent stance that the major intention behind the Indian government\u2019s illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019 was to change the demographic structure of IOJ&K and turn Kashmiris into a minority in their own land. This has long been part of the RSS-BJP\u2019s \u201cHindutva\u201d agenda.\n\n'Peaceful Afghanistan'\n\nBriefing about yesterday's meeting between Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, the FO said, \u201cAmbassador Khalilzad\u2019s visit to Pakistan was part of his regular engagement for consultations and exchange of views on the Afghan peace and reconciliation process.\u201d\n\nThe foreign minister highlighted Pakistan\u2019s positive contribution to the US-Taliban direct talks, culminating in the peace agreement of February 29, 2020, and stressed that the Afghan leaders should seize this historic opportunity and work together to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive political settlement, the FO spokesperson stated.\n\n\u201cForeign Minister Qureshi welcomed the latest developments, including announcements on formation of negotiating team and establishment of High Council of National Reconciliation,\u201d Farooqui said, adding that he hopes the release of prisoners would be completed soon to pave the way for the earliest commencement of Intra-Afghan negotiations.\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, FM Qureshi reiterated Pakistan\u2019s commitment to continue working with regional and international partners to support efforts for a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan.\n\n\"Pakistan remains ready to engage in endeavours to facilitate closer Pakistan-Afghanistan economic partnership and regional connectivity projects,\" she said.\n\nThe meeting between the Advisor to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Investment Abdul Razak Dawood and the US International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) Chief Executive Officer Adam Boehler, at the Ministry of Commerce yesterday, would further strengthen efforts in concretising important development projects benefitting both Pakistan and Afghanistan and the region as a whole, the FO maintained.\n\nDuring his meeting with the foreign minister, Ambassador Khalilzad also expressed condolences on the loss of lives in the terrorist attack on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in Karachi, and extended US' support, she informed.\n\nThe foreign minister praised the bravery of the security personnel and thanked Ambassador Khalilzad for the condolences on the terrorist attack, that was externally supported and was another manifestation of the state-sponsored terrorism being perpetrated against Pakistan, \"which we condemn in the strongest possible terms,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\u201cPakistan has been consistently sensitizing the international community about the Indian leadership\u2019s threatening statements to use terrorism as a tool to destabilise Pakistan,\u201d Farooqui observed. \u201cPakistan has already shared with the international community, incriminating evidence about the Indian Intelligence Agency RAW\u2019s involvement in terrorist activities in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nShe added that members of the UN Security Council in their statement on Wednesday (July 1) condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack that took place in Karachi, on June 29 , 2020, which resulted in the deaths of several people.\n\n\u201cThe members of the Security Council expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government of Pakistan,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey also underlined the need to bring the perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice and urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Government of Pakistan and all other relevant authorities in this regard,\u201d the FO spokesperson added.\n\nReptriation of citizens\n\nSeparately, the FM also held a telephonic conversation with High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy H.E. Josep Borrell, on Wednesday, informed Farooqui.\n\nBoth leaders exchanged views on a range of subjects related to Pakistan-EU partnership, including trade, the next phase of GSP Plus, and early operationalisation of the Strategic Engagement Plan (SEP).\n\n\u201cMinistry of Foreign Affairs and our Missions continue to facilitate and assist our fellow compatriots all across the world in order to bring them back to Pakistan safely and in a dignified manner,\u201d she said. \u201cOur Embassies and Consulates are working round the clock in facilitating repatriation of our citizens back home, in accordance with a comprehensive repatriation plan devised in consultation with all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson Aisha Farooqui added that in the past few days, 257 Pakistanis were repatriated from Malaysia, Cambodia, Singapore and Brunei; 9,504 from Dubai and Northern Emirates; 1,430 from Jeddah; 25 from Dushanbe and 96 from Kazakhstan.\n\n\u201cSo far, 113,154 Pakistani nationals have been repatriated from different parts of the world,\" she said. \u201cWe thank all the governments of these countries for their cooperation in facilitating the repatriation of our nationals.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nUN chief urged to appoint envoy on Occupied Kashmir\n\nRead More\n\n\u2018India targets Kashmiris, threatens Pakistan to hide discomfiture from China\u2019\n\nRead More\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nGun battles leave 12 dead in Occupied Kashmir\n\nSix global rights bodies call on India to release detained Kashmiris\n\nKashmiri leadership lauds UN chief's call for release of IOK prisoners\n\nFacebook Conversations\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nReplying to\n\nX\n\nSaved !

He told the National Assembly, \u201cOur security forces fought and thwarted a huge tragedy which was planned by our neighbouring country India.\u201d He did not give a single piece of evidence against India, because he did not have any.\n\nRajat Sharma\n\n@RajatSharmaLive\n\nNew Delhi\n\nUpdated on: July 03, 2020 11:21 IST\n\nImage Source : INDIA TV\n\nAaj Ki Baat July 2 episode\n\nOn Wednesday, when pictures of a three-year-old boy weeping over his grandfather Bashir Ahmed Khan\u2019s bullet-riddled body in Sopore, Kashmir, flashed across the world, the Pakistani fake propaganda machine went into a tizzy. This was a picture that showed the terrorists in a poor light, while the video of our security force jawan staking his life to rescue the child from terrorist firing showed how our brave men are trying to save lives of innocent people while fighting battles with terrorists.\n\nThe three-year-old child is now safe with his parents in Srinagar, but the Pakistani fake propaganda machine has spun a web of lies. It alleged that CRPF jawans dragged Bashir Ahmed Khan out of his car, which was caught in the crossfire, and shot him dead. The Pakistani propaganda machine made no mention of how security personnel ran in the midst of firing, scooped up the child and took him to safety. No mention, nothing.\n\nNaturally, the Pakistani propaganda about CRPF jawans killing the grandpa and minutes later, the video of a policeman rushing in to rescue the child, can put a James Hadley Chase suspense to shame. The mastermind behind this fake propaganda game seems to be China. How?\n\nOn June 29, four fighters of Balochistan Liberation Army, an outfit fighting for the independence of Balochistan for several decades, attacked Karachi Stock Exchange and in the firefight that ensued, eight persons, including the four Baloch fighters, were killed.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, blamed the attack on India. He told the National Assembly, \u201cOur security forces fought and thwarted a huge tragedy which was planned by our neighbouring country India.\u201d He did not give a single piece of evidence against India, because he did not have any.\n\nThe Pakistani foreign ministry then took the matter to the floor of the United Nations Security Council, by prodding its ally, China, which is a permanent member. The draft statement was stalled for nearly 24 hours by the US and Germany. The German representative said, he wanted to consult his government in Berlin and got an extension of time, and then the US took more time to study the statement. The final statement was perfunctory, as such statements are issued after every big terror attack.\n\n\u201cThe members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack that took place in Karachi, Pakistan, on 29 June 2020, which resulted in several people killed,\u201d it said in a statement, more than 24 hours after the first draft was circulated by Pakistan\u2019s ally China on Tuesday.\n\nClearly, China is using Pakistan as a vassal state to help in its game plan against India. The Pakistani fake propaganda machine, backed by its army, is now in full gear with help from China.\n\nThe sad part is that there are people in India who blindly toe the fake Pakistani propaganda line which said CRPF jawans dragged out the child\u2019s grandfather from his car and shot him dead. These individuals do not trust the versions of Kashmir Police IGP and SHO.

However, Hurriyat issued a press release and criticised the ceasefire by Hizbul Mujahideen, which indicates that the Hurriyat wanted bloodbath and continue with its politics on Kashmir\", said\n\nJunaid\n\n, who is also the director of Amsterdam based European Foundation for South Asian Studies (\n\nEFSAS\n\n).\n\nHurriyat used to propagate itself as a political face of\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\nand never welcomed any militant group to join the peace process, said\n\nJunaid\n\n.\n\nHe said that\n\nHurriyat Conference\n\nclaims to have been the sole representatives of the people of\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n, but unfortunately they even don't represent the people of Kashmir valley.\n\n\"There are three\n\nHurriyat Conference\n\ns and none of them have a member from Jammu and Ladakh. Even from Valley, they might be representing few people from some areas,\" said\n\nJunaid\n\nwhile adding that people from other communities like Hindu pundits, Dogras and Sikhs have no presence in the Hurriyat.\n\nJunaid\n\nadded, \"\n\nHurriyat Conference\n\npropagates accession to\n\nPakistan\n\nand I believe if they propagate accession to\n\nPakistan\n\nand they even claim to have been the sole representatives of people of\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n, then why do we need Hurriyat?\n\nPakistan\n\nalso says that same thing. Why we need Hurriyat for mediation?\".\n\n\"The All Party\n\nHurriyat Conference\n\nsplit in 2004 and then in 2014 and they failed to remain united despite having same political ideology and religion\", said\n\nJunaid\n\n.\n\nThe intellectual believes that a large section of Muslims in Kashmir do not support\n\nPakistan\n\n's ideology because the Muslims of valley believe in Sufism and not in Islamist ideology.\n\nHe said, \"\n\nPakistan\n\nitself has occupied a large portion of\n\nJammu and Kashmir\n\n, whereas it is backing\n\nHurriyat Conference\n\nin the Kashmir valley to work on the ideology of separatism. This is illogical\".\n\n\"A large number of Hurriyat leaders and separatists are languishing in jails these days, how many people in Kashmir are protesting in support of them.

An analysis would reveal three triggers: The\n\nBalakot\n\nattack of February 2019, the return of the\n\nBJP\n\ngovernment in the May 2019 elections and the August 2019 revision of\n\nArticle 370\n\n.\n\nBalakot demolished Pakistan\u2019s longstanding assumption that the nuclear equivalence guaranteed that India would not retaliate against terrorist attacks. The return of the BJP government signalled that India would continue to follow a muscular policy for the next five years. The Article 370 decision demolished the centrepiece of Pakistan\u2019s nationalism \u2014 \u201cKashmir banega Pakistan\u201d \u2014 and raised apprehensions about India\u2019s plans for Pakistan Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK).\n\nThese developments have forced it to shift the emphasis of its anti-India strategy from fomenting terrorism supported by an information war component to an information war supported by terrorism.\n\nhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png\n\nPakistan has two main instruments working in tandem for the furtherance of this policy \u2014 the ISI and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The ISPR is a one-stop-shop for the info war against India. It has, over the years, recruited thousands of youth, trained them in the mechanics of social media and used them to project anti-India themes.\n\nThe core Pakistani objective is to demolish \u201cBrand India\u201d by attacking its key components \u2014 an inclusive and secular society, democratic polity, decisive government, a developing economic powerhouse and strong foreign policy. This has been done by trying to polarise society and disrupt social cohesion. The expectation is that such a strategy would have a cascading effect, adversely impacting India\u2019s secular and democratic credentials, scare foreign investment and lead to questions about its international image.\n\nThe key platforms for this strategy are Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and\n\nFacebook\n\n. A large number of fake social media accounts, especially on Twitter, have been created. Even though Twitter is not the most popular platform in terms of numbers in either India or Pakistan, it is perhaps the most effective form of instant communication. Pakistan has developed malicious narratives embellished with fake audio and video clips. The use of handles with phoney Middle Eastern identities is the latest addition to its bag of tricks.\n\nInternal developments and dissent in India have been manipulated, packaged and used to develop a narrative damaging India\u2019s social fabric. Key themes include India disenfranchising Muslims, and the \u201cfascist Indian government\u2019s\u201d Hindutva supremacist ideology.\n\nOn J&K, the key themes are: Kashmir is a \u201cdisputed territory\u201d awaiting solution under the UN resolutions; India needs to talk to Pakistan to resolve the issue and since India refuses to talk, there must be international intervention; Kashmiris want \u201cazaadi\u201d; Kashmiris are waging a jihad against India; the Indian Army is violating the human rights of Kashmiris. Recently, they are propagating that India is preparing a false flag operation and genocide of Muslims in Kashmir.\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that the same anti-India narrative is repeated ad nauseam from every medium and platform \u2014 whether it is politicians like\n\nImran Khan\n\nor Shah Mehmood Qureshi, the ISPR, or print, electronic and social media.\n\nOne indicator of Pakistan\u2019s strategy is available in the Pakistan Army\u2019s Green Book 2020. An article by Lt. General Raza Muhammad Khan (Retd.) states: \u201cWith the proliferation of the internet, nowadays nothing can escape exaggeration, distortion and fabrication to manipulate perceptions on crucial issues of peace and security.\u201d Another article by one Farzana Shah states: \u201cA single video clip or picture can change the perception of India, which it has built so painstakingly over the years.\u201d\n\nFor India, there has to be a relentless vigil and battle against this campaign just as there has been against terrorism fomented by Pakistan. Even though the Indian polity is strong, such persistent venomous attacks can temporarily damage our social fabric. We must not allow ourselves, wittingly or unwittingly, to fall prey to such machinations to polarise society, even temporarily.\n\nDevasher is Member, National Security Advisory Board and author of three books on Pakistan.

These ridiculous assertions have neither legal validity nor international credibility,\u201d a press statement of the Ministry of External Affairs said.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the document firms up its claims on Sir Creek and the Siachen glacier. During the presentation on the map following a Cabinet meeting in Islamabad, the Pakistan Prime Minister referred to the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 which removed the special status to Jammu and Kashmir and said, the map is an expression of Pakistan\u2019s long nurtured aspiration. \u201cOur aim is Srinagar,\u201d said Mr. Qureshi. The new political map has also removed the reference of Federally Administered Tribal Area and has depicted that area as part of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It also leaves an undefined section towards Ladakh which according to Mr. Qureshi will be resolved in future.\n\nThe MEA referred to the map as an expression of Pakistan\u2019s \u2018obsession\u2019. \u201cThese ridiculous assertions have neither legal validity nor international credibility. In fact, this new effort only confirms reality of Pakistan\u2019s obsession with territorial aggrandisement supported by cross-border terrorism,\u201d it said.\n\nThis is the second such map revising territorial claims in South Asia after Nepal printed a political map in May showing the Kalapani region of Pithoragarh district as part of its sovereign territory. Nepal had blamed India for asserting claims over the region in the political map that India published in November 2019 which showed the new Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh that were born after New Delhi abrogated Article 370 which had guaranteed special status for the region.\n\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.\n\nTo get full access, please subscribe.\n\nAlready have an account ?\n\nSign in\n\nShow Less Plan\n\nStart your 14 days free trial.\n\nSign Up\n\nA letter from the Editor\n\nDear reader,\n\nWe have been keeping you up-to-date with information on the developments in India and the world that have a bearing on our health and wellbeing, our lives and livelihoods, during these difficult times.

Thus, the new political map of Pakistan.\n\n15649\n\nPOLITICS\n\n| \u00a05-minute read\n\n|\n\n13-08-2020\n\nHarshil Mehta\n\n@MehHarshil\n\n---\n\nTotal Shares\n\nWhen India was marking one year of abrogation of Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special status and PM Modi was performing the ground-breaking\n\nbhoomi poojan\n\nceremony of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya,\n\nPakistan was busy changing its political map\n\n. In the new political map, it has not only included Gilgit-Baltistan and so-called Azad Kashmir as its territories, but also shown the buffer zone like Sir Creek and Indian territories of Junagadh and Manavadar. India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs termed this Pakistan\u2019s \u2018political absurdity\u2019.\n\nThe new map shows buffer zone like Sir Creek and Indian territories of Junagadh and Manavadar as Pakistani territories. (Photo: Twitter/ @pid_gov)\n\nThis is the neighbouring country\u2019s latest step after the completion of the first round of propaganda on Kashmir. In the past year, Pakistan has tried every single step possible to draw the world\u2019s attention to the Kashmir issue and what it calls \u201cIndian oppression\u201d. On every international platform, Pakistan\u2019s PM Imran Khan and his appointees have tried to bring in the issue of Kashmir.\n\nIn September 2019, Imran Khan visited the US and UN General Assembly. In his speech, he constantly highlighted Kashmir. In the speech at UN General Assembly, he\n\nsaid\n\nthat a \u201cblood bath\u201d will ensue if and when Indian authorities lift\u00a0the curfew over the disputed territory. He even\n\nwarned\n\nof a potential nuclear war. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi\n\nwrote seven letters to the UN\n\nas of December 2019, and repeated the rhetoric that India has been deploying missiles in the region.\n\nImran Khan and his ministers have not limited their efforts to the UN. They have been trying to utilise every single international platform for Kashmir issue. Even in June 2020, Pakistan\n\nasked\n\nthe Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) to \u201cfacilitate solution on Kashmir.\u201d Earlier this year, at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Imran Khan again\n\nurged\n\nthe US President to mediate on the issue. These are just glimpses of what the Pakistani establishment has done to try and internationalise the issue.\n\nThe Pakistani bandwagon doesn\u2019t stop at international platforms. It is constantly trying to keep the issue alive at the domestic level too. Earlier this month, Pakistan\n\nchanged\n\nthe name of Kashmir Highway to Srinagar Highway to show solidarity with the Kashmiris. Be it issuing\n\npostal stamps\n\n, or organising \u201cKashmir Solidarity Day\u201d marches in Pakistan, or\n\ntweeting\n\nfake videos to show that Muslims are oppressed in India \u2014 Imran Khan has tried them all.\n\n\u06cc\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0635\u0627\u0644 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u06d2 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0631 \u06cc\u06a9\u062c\u06c1\u062a\u06cc \u0648\u0627\u06a9 \u06a9\u0646\u0648\u0646\u0634\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0679\u0631 \u0633\u06d2 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06c1\u0648\u0627\u06a9 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u062b\u06cc\u0631 \u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f \u06a9\u06cc \u0634\u0631\u06a9\u062a\u06d4\n\n#YOUM_E_ISTEHSAL\n\n#EndIllegalSiegeofKashmir\n\n#EndPersecutionofKashmiris\n\n#KashmirSiegeDay\n\n#IIOJKUnderSiege\n\npic.twitter.com/Ve9HuYEr5o\n\n\u2014 Govt of Pakistan (@pid_gov)\n\nAugust 5, 2020\n\nBut to what results? Clearly, nothing.\n\nBesides its usual allies \u2014 Turkey and China \u2014 no one is buying Pakistan\u2019s propaganda on Kashmir and Indian Muslims. US President Donald Trump has constantly been\n\nchanging\n\nhis stand on mediation, as he usually does in domestic politics. More recently,\n\nSaudi Arabia ended a loan and oil supply to Pakistan\n\nafter the latter\u2019s criticism that the Saudi-led OIC is not doing enough to pressure India on the Kashmir issue.\n\nFrom trying to raise the Kashmir issue on international platforms to organising \u201cKashmir Solidarity Day\u201d marches at home, Imran Khan has tried every trick in the book. (Photo: Twitter/ @pid_gov)\n\nWith his propaganda over Kashmir issue proving to be unsuccessful, it now seems that Khan needs something new to sell at the domestic and international level. Thus, the new political map with the inclusion of Junagadh and Manavadar with Sir Creek.\n\nDomestically, it seems that Imran Khan has lost the hold over the Pakistani public. Firstly, the Pakistan government miserably failed to impose lockdown and control the spread of Covid-19 in the country. Second, the country\u2019s economic condition is worsening with each passing day. It has been stuck in China\u2019s debt-trap policy. Saudi Arabia ending the loan has further worsened the situation. Third, and most importantly, no major country is convinced to stand with Pakistan over the Kashmir conflict.\n\nThe Pakistani state is defined by two pillars, as scholar Madiha Afzal notes in her work\n\nPakistan Under Siege\n\n. These are \u2015 Islam, and paranoia about India. In a 2010 survey, when Pakistani citizens were\n\nasked\n\nwhat the biggest threat to their country was, a whopping 53 per cent of the respondents said it was India. 23 per cent said Taliban, and a measly three per cent said Al-Qaeda. So Khan knows that anti-India sentiments are more prevalent in his country than the fear of terrorism. By releasing the new political map, he wants to further aggravate the sentiment and consolidate his vote bank.\n\nOf course, this does not make any major difference on the ground. However, there are many things that can be expected, like creating fake social-media profiles and peddling fake stories about India 'occupying' Junagadh and Manavadar, maliciously capturing Indian fishermen near Sir Creek, and creating rhetoric about Indian territories on international platforms. But then, what better can we expect?\n\nAlso Read: Imran Khan must remember India is global power, Pakistan a sinking ship\n\n#Article 370 repealed\n\n,\n\n#Kashmir\n\n,\n\n#Imran Khan\n\n,\n\n#Pakistanmap\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

India accused Pakistan of being behind the attack from the get-go \u2014 a charge Islamabad has vehemently denied.\n\nIn a statement, Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Zahid Chaudhri said that Islamabad categorically rejected the \"so-called 'charge sheet'\" by the NIA which \"mischievously attempts to implicate Pakistan in the Pulwama attack\" in Indian-occupied Kashmir.\n\n\"At the outset, Pakistan had rejected India\u2019s baseless allegations and expressed readiness to extend cooperation on the basis of any actionable information.\n\n\"India failed to provide any credible evidence for its invective and has instead been using the attack for its malicious propaganda campaign against Pakistan.\"\n\nA day earlier, the Indian investigation agency had filed a 13,500-page report before a special court in which it named 19 people who it said allegedly carried out the attack at Pakistan's behest,\n\nHindustan Times\n\nreported.\n\nOfficials said the charge sheet had \"irrefutable evidence\" \u2014 technical, material and circumstantial \u2014  on Pakistan\u2019s role in the attack, the report added.\n\nIn his statement, the FO spokesperson said the timing of the Pulwama attack, just two months before the Lok Sabha elections in India, the fact that the explosives used in the attack were collected from inside occupied Kashmir, and that the key accused persons in the attack have already been killed by Indian forces, \"raise too many questions\".\n\n\"The world knows well as to who benefited the most from the Pulwama attack and drew electoral dividends.\"\n\nThe statement added that Indian military aircraft engaged in belligerent action against Pakistan on February 26, 2019.\n\nTimeline:\n\nEvents leading up to the Feb 2019 Pak-India aerial combat\n\n\"The Indian misadventure was effectively countered by the Pakistan Air Force, which resulted in the downing of two Indian warplanes and the capture of an Indian pilot.

However, she emphasised that financing remained the missing link in achieving that goal.\n\n\u201cFinancing for such power plants will become a huge issue in the next 5-10 years and a lot of people will be talking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be the largest roadblock, hindering the improvement of power infrastructure in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that, project financing was not offered to power distributors and generators in Pakistan, even for relatively large installations aimed at industrial or commercial consumers, she said.\n\nAccording to her, this is perhaps the biggest hurdle in the way of growing the power sector and leveraging it. She underlined that the lack of financing acted as a constraint to sustainable energy supply to consumers.\n\nDrawing comparisons with India, Malik regretted that per capita energy consumption in Pakistan stood half in Pakistan. However, she stressed that power demand was bound to rise and it could increase fairly quickly if economic situation improved.\n\nAlso present in the session, Planning Commission\u2019s former member energy Akhtar Ali said average power demand per district in Pakistan stood around 300-400 megawatts and one renewable energy plant per district could provide 30,000-40,000MW on average.\n\nHe emphasised that the country should only go for renewable energy after 2025 in a bid to become self-sufficient.\n\nThe ex-member energy also highlighted that earlier the storage capacity for renewable energy was costly, which now became affordable, hence, Pakistan was in a better position to produce electricity from eco-friendly methods.\n\nPakistan Electric Power Company\u2019s (Pepco) former managing director Tahir Basharat Cheema highlighted that around 1999-2000, Pakistan had surplus power generation and the country even offered to sell electricity to India.\n\n\u201cAt that time, the country did not have to worry about energy but by 2006, Pakistan began facing load-shedding,\u201d he said. \u201cNow in 2020, we are talking about surplus energy when load-shedding is still rampant, hence, we do not have surplus capacity.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that power companies resorted to revenue-based load-shedding as the areas providing low revenue faced higher load-shedding. Owing to that strategy, a majority of areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were suffering, he added.\n\nHe stressed the need for efficient energy management and asked the authorities to distribute power to the areas having energy efficiency.\n\nOther topics discussed at the webinar were transformation of Pakistan\u2019s energy infrastructure and elite capture.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 4\n\nth\n\n, 2020.\n\nLike\n\nBusiness on Facebook\n\n,\n\nfollow\n\n@TribuneBiz\n\non Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.\n\nFacebook Conversations\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nReplying to\n\nX\n\nSaved !

Photo:\u00a0 Lt Gen (retd) Asim Bajwa Twitter\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China signed an agreement for the construction of $1.5 billion Azad Pattan Hydel Power Project, Chairman CPEC Authority Asim Saleem Bajwa said on Monday.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan witnessed the signing ceremony.\n\nAddressing the ceremony, the prime minister said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project will prove to be a milestone in the country's development and prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe CPEC is the future of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nThe premier further said time would prove the long term benefits of the CPEC project, which was based upon economic cooperation between Pakistan and China.\n\nHe said Pakistan could learn a lot from China in realms of economic progress and prosperity as the country was fast emerging as world economic power.\n\nHe expressed the optimism that in the future, they would learn from the Chinese experiences. The CPEC had different phases with various bright aspects for prosperity and progress, he added.\n\nReferring to the signing of the agreement, PM Imran said it was part of the investment to complete a power project based upon the clean energy.\n\nUnlike past, the project would not burden the people, he said and mentioned the previous governments\u2019 costly projects which were made functional with imported fuel, thus increasing the cost of energy manifold and stressing the local currency.\n\nThe prime minister said due to those policies, the power industry ran into losses impacting the consumers.\n\nHe regretted that the country could not compete with its neighbouring countries in terms of generating the low-cost energy.\n\nHe said the hydro-power generation was considered as a big source of clean energy which was also in line with his government\u2019s policy of \u2018Clean and Green Pakistan\u2019 and regarded as environment friendly.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt Gen (retd) Bajwa said 3000 jobs would be created through the mega project and it would provide an annual income of Rs1.38 billion to Punjab and Azad Kashmir from water use.\n\nHe added, \u201cWith an investment of $1.5 billion, no fuel import, we are moving towards cheaper and greener power.\"\n\nWhat is Azad Pattan hydropower project?\n\nLast year in November,\u00a0Pakistan and China agreed to include 700 megawatts Azad Pattan hydropower project under the CPEC. which is to be financed through Chinese currency.\n\nAzad Pattan hydropower project is a run-of-the-river scheme on the River Jhelum, in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir, with a capability of four hours of daily peaking.\n\nThe project would be located near the Azad Pattan bridge upstream of 720 MW Karot hydropower project and downstream of 640 MW Mahal hydropower project and would be part of the River Jhelum hydel cascade.\n\nThe project would deliver approximately 3.3 billion units of clean, renewable energy in the grid after its completion in 2026.\n\nBeing developed under the 2002 power policy, the project would be transferred free of cost to the government after the term.\n\nMore From Pakistan:\n\npakistan\n\nPMC issues important clarification on MDCAT 2020 syllabus\n\npakistan\n\nEU had opposed Pakistan's exit from FATF grey list ahead of plenary\n\npakistan\n\nSheikh Rasheed makes predictions about PM Imran Khan, inflation\n\npakistan\n\nWill go to UK if need be to bring Nawaz Sharif back: PM Imran Khan\n\npakistan\n\nReference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa filed in complete disregard of the law: Supreme Court\n\npakistan\n\nQureshi warns of 'trap' laid by India to 'drag Pakistan back to ICJ'\n\npakistan\n\nBalochistan govt urges PDM to delay Quetta jalsa amid security fears\n\npakistan\n\nMaskan blast: Death toll rises to 6, PTI's Alamgir Khan demands relief package\n\npakistan\n\nGovt ready to make amendments Sindh wants in island ordinance: AGP\n\npakistan\n\nEU ambassadors meet PML-N's Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, talk 'current developments'\n\npakistan\n\nPakistan to remain on FATF's grey list for now\n\npakistan\n\nSindh govt announces public holiday on Oct 30 for 12th Rabi ul Awwal\n\ndetail\n\nLatest\n\nview all\n\n33 minutes ago\n\nMeghan Markle drives a wedge between Prince Harry and royal family?\n\n41 minutes ago\n\n'Ertugrul' Halime Sultan's mesmerising pics will cast a magic on you: See Pics\n\nan hour ago\n\nBoxer Amir Khan's house gets police visit after a mysterious call\n\nan hour ago\n\nTom Hanks got Covid-19 from Borat?\n\nvar BaseURL = 'https://www.geo.tv/';\r\n    var Page = 'latest\",\"pakistan';\r\n    var sg = 'latest';\n", "date": "2020-07-06", "label": true, "url": "https://www.geo.tv/latest/296598-pakistan-china-to-ink-agreement-for-azad-pattan-hydel-power-projects-construction-today"}

(Photo courtesy PID/Radio Pakistan)\n\nISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN - Pakistan and close ally China have formally launched construction at a multibillion-dollar dam in the Pakistan-administered part of the disputed Kashmir region, ignoring rival India\u2019s objections to the project.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan visited the site Wednesday along with top military leaders and the Chinese ambassador in Islamabad to mark what officials hailed as a \"historic milestone.\u201d\n\nThe Diamer Bhasha multipurpose dam is expected to be completed in 2028, with a total cost of more than $8 billion. It is expected to generate 4,500 megawatts of inexpensive and clean electricity.\n\n\u201cThis will be Pakistan\u2019s third large dam, whereas neighboring China has built nearly 5,000 large dams out of its more than 80,000 dams in total,\u201d Khan said.\n\nThe dam, with a usable storage capacity of about 6.5 million acre-feet of water, will stand at a height of 272 meters in northern Gilgit-Baltistan region, about 400 kilometers from Pakistan\u2019s only overland crossing with China.\n\nOfficials said the project will also help in flood control and add 1.2 million acres of agriculture land, in addition to creating 16,000 jobs for local residents.\n\nA consortium of state-owned China Power and the Pakistan army\u2019s commercial wing, Frontier Works Organization (FWO), is building the project on a 70-to-30 ratio.\n\nIndia, which controls most of Kashmir and claims it in its entirety, as does Pakistan, has denounced the project as a violation of its territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe Pakistani and Chinese governments have rejected Indian concerns as misplaced, insisting the economic collaboration is aimed at improving \u201cthe well-being of the local people.\u201d\n\nCPEC collaboration\n\nThe dam, however, is not part of the ongoing multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, a centerpiece of President Xi Jinping\u2019s global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nBeijing has also signed within the past month two agreements with Islamabad under the CPEC to directly invest up to $4 billion to develop two hydroelectric power projects in Kashmir, with a total capacity of about 1,800 megawatts.\n\nMichael Kugelman, deputy director at the Asia program of the Washington, D.C.-based Wilson Center, sees the growing Chinese investments in Pakistan-administered Kashmir a blow to India.\n\n\u201cThese moves will bring one more tension point to an India-China relationship that is already more strained now than it has been for several decades,\u201d he said.\n\nKugelman was referring to last month\u2019s border clash between the two countries in the western Himalayas in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Chinese and Indian officials are currently engaged in talks to ease the tensions.\n\n\u201cWe can also read them, in part, as a defiant response by both Beijing and Islamabad to increasing Indian verbal threats in recent months to make some sort of move on Pakistan-administered Kashmir,\u201d said Kugelman.\n\nIndian leaders have repeatedly alleged in recent months that militants are preparing to infiltrate into India-controlled Kashmir from the Pakistani side and warned of a cross-border counter military action which would fuel mutual tensions.\n\nChina has invested about $29 billion in Pakistan, including direct investment, soft loans and grants, which has been or is building power plants, roads, rails, the new deep-sea port of Gwadar and an adjoining international airport in Baluchistan province.\n\nChinese and Pakistani officials say the investment has created an estimated 75,000 jobs for locals and effectively reduced, if not ended, years of crippling power blackouts in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cDespite the outbreak of COVID-19, work on the CPEC has been underway in full swing, and new projects under the mutual collaboration will be launched in coming days,\u201d Asim Saleem Bajwa, an aide to the prime minister who is overseeing the massive the program, told a recent meeting of Pakistani and Chinese officials.\n\nBajwa was apparently responding to reports that the coronavirus pandemic has slowed work on CPEC projects.\n\n'Debt trap'\n\nCPEC investments, however, have worried critics at home and outside Pakistan, who have expressed concerns and skepticism in the wake of the financial crunch facing the country.\n\nThe United States also has been critical of the bilateral undertaking.\n\nAlice Wells, who recently retired as the Trump administration\u2019s senior diplomat for South and Central Asia, had been publicly warning that Chinese investments under the CPEC could become a debt trap for Pakistan in the long run, citing relatively high costs and alleged lack of transparency in contracts, among other concerns.\n\n\u201cHopefully, not at the cost of Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty, environment, sustainability of debt or corruption. This is a good time to renegotiate BRI terms that, in hindsight, were disadvantageous or one-sided,\u201d Wells tweeted earlier this month.\n\nShe was responding to comments by Khan that his government would complete the estimated $40 billion to $60 billion CPEC project \u201cat any cost\u201d for it being \u201cthe future of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nIslamabad and Beijing have vehemently rejected as misplaced concerns about the CPEC being a \u201cdebt trap\u201d or a burden on Pakistan\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cCPEC, as flagship of BRI, is already a success story, and has entered its second phase successfully,\" noted Mushahid Hussain, who heads the Pakistani Senate\u2019s foreign affairs committee. \u201cEnergy and infrastructure projects have been completed on schedule, 75,000 Pakistanis have got jobs in BRI projects, and 28,000 Pakistani students are studying in China.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nMilitant Ambush Kills 3 Pakistani Troops in Baluchistan\n\nSeparatist group takes responsibility for attack that also left five soldiers in critical condition\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nTue, 07/14/2020 - 02:52 PM\n\nScience & Health\n\nPakistan to Resume Anti-Polio Drive as COVID-19 Infections Decline\n\nWHO warns poliovirus transmission in Pakistan 'continues to be widespread'\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nTue, 07/14/2020 - 12:16 PM\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nCOVID Cooperation, Kashmir Approach Show Signs of Improving US-Pakistan Ties\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan told parliament last week that his country's often uneasy and mistrusted relations with Trump's administration have seen significant improvement over the past two years\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nFri, 07/03/2020 - 12:04 PM\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nCaught Between Virus and Violence in Indian Kashmir\n\nEver since the Indian government enforced a lockdown in Kashmir following the outbreak of COVID-19, violence has surged in the area\n\nBy\n\nMuheet Ul Islam\n\nTue, 06/30/2020 - 05:46 AM\n\nBy\n\nAyaz Gul\n\nTwitter\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nFacebook\n\nYouTube\n\nRSS\n\nSwitch to Dark mode\n\nSwitch to Light mode\n\nSearch VOA News\n\nSearch\n\nUnited States\n\nUS Politics\n\nImmigration\n\nAll About America\n\nSilicon Valley and Technology\n\nWorld News\n\nAfrica\n\nThe Americas\n\nEast Asia Pacific\n\nEurope\n\nMiddle East\n\nSouth & Central Asia\n\nSections\n\nArts & Culture\n\nDay in Photos\n\nEconomy & Business\n\nExtremism Watch\n\nPress Freedom\n\nScience & Health\n\nVOA StudentU\n\nVOA Connect\n\nRefugees\n\nVoice of America\n\nAbout VOA\n\nContact VOA\n\nTerms of Use and Privacy Notice\n\nAccessibility\n\nGet Our Mobile App\n\nUsage Requests\n\nVOA Around the World\n\nVOA Pronunciation Guide\n\nMedia Relations\n\nListen on the radio\n\nSatellite Schedule\n\nSubscribe to Our Newsletters\n", "date": "2020-07-15", "label": true, "url": "https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/chinas-investments-pakistan-administered-kashmir-seen-blow-india"}

It was understood that Khan\u2019s government had sought a reset of CPEC, which was seen as closely aligned with the previous regime.\n\nThe man in the middle of the CPEC\u2019s reinvigoration is Asim Saleem Bajwa, appointed last year to run the CPEC Authority, which oversees more than $70 billion in projects from highways to power plants.\n\nThe CPEC is a planned network of roads, railways and energy projects linking China\u2019s resource-rich Xinjiang province with Pakistan\u2019s strategic Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.\n\nThrough the CPEC, Islamabad seeks to leverage Chinese capital, production capacity, and know-how in order to upgrade Pakistan\u2019s infrastructure and build a mechanism for sustainable economic growth.\n\nIn return, Beijing acquires a connection to the Arabian Sea, offering a contingency trade route to the risk-prone Malacca Strait in Southeast Asia.\n\nWith the CPEC seen as the flagship project for China\u2019s BRI and its wider strategic commitment in the region, the need to display progress is imperative.\n\nHowever, the reality was that until this point much of the CPEC, like BRI more broadly, was in a state of paralysis.\n\nFork(s) in the road?\n\nEntering 2020, the\n\nsecond phase\n\nof the multibillion-dollar project is projected to generate massive employment opportunities and assist cash-strapped Pakistan to upgrade its key industrial and agricultural sectors.\n\nAlthough the transport corridor has been the primary international focus, power generation makes up the bulk of completed projects.\n\nThe\n\nMERICS database\n\nshows that $25.5 billion worth of projects completed, 75 percent of them were energy projects. This included solar, hydro and wind powered generation, while fossil-fuel fired capacity constituted around 60 percent of the added mega-wattage, excluding nuclear.\n\nMany of the so-called \u201cearly harvest\u201d projects completed in 2020 have come in delayed or over budget.\n\nAfter facing another balance of payments crisis in 2018, Khan was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a\n\n$6 billion bailout\n\n. While Pakistan\u2019s economic troubles predate the CPEC, it is an ambitious gambit that heightens any risk and disproportionately contributes to its financial distress.\n\nDebt sustainability aside, whether Pakistan is well positioned to reap any of the potential benefits of the CPEC as its second phase gets underway, remains an open question.\n\nIts poor ranking in\n\nhuman development indexes, combined with a lack of soft infrastructure and poor rural connectivity\n\nin place, makes attracting necessary investments in the industrial sector an uphill climb.\n\nThere are also the ongoing security costs of the project, amid a\n\nresurgence of deadly attacks by separatists\n\nin Balochistan province, where the Gwadar port is located.\n\nLast Tuesday, three soldiers were killed in an attack on a paramilitary convoy in Panjgur district \u2013 the third such attack since May. In August 2018, militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) killed three Chinese engineers and wounded five others in the town of Dalbadin, in the most lethal attack on Chinese personnel since CPEC was launched in 2015.\n\nBeijing also struggles with local politics and bureaucracy. Even when Gwadar was facing power outages, the provincial government of Balochistan took over three years to approve construction on the Gwadar power project.\n\nThere is also the issue of\n\ncorruption and the outsized influence\n\nof the military.\n\nAfter promising to review the terms of CPEC during his electoral campaign, Khan and his incoming government saw swift pushback from China and the Pakistani military to maintain CPEC as the nexus of their bilateral relationship.\n\nThe army\n\nstated\n\nthat the project was \u201cdestined to succeed despite all odds\u201d and that it would ensure its security at all costs.\n\nIt might hardly be a coincidence then, that retired general Bajwa, formerly the head of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistan Army, was named the head of the CPEC Authority \u2013 set up by Khan in 2019. Bajwa has since also been named the special assistant to the prime minister on information, a cabinet level position.\n\nPakistan\u2019s army, which notably controls a number of industries in the country, stands to benefit financially from the CPEC. Reporting for the New York Times, Maria Abi-Habib\n\nclaimed\n\nthat the army \u201cstands to fill its coffers with millions of dollars through CPEC as the military\u2019s construction companies win infrastructure bids\u201d.\n\nIn May 2020, Pakistan\u2019s government awarded a $5.8 billion dam-building\n\ncontract to a joint venture\n\nof a Chinese state-owned company with the commercial unit of the Pakistani army.\n\nStrategic pitfalls\n\nDeference to China extends beyond CPEC.\n\nFor a country that claims to speak up for the rights of Muslims worldwide, Pakistan has turned a blind eye to Beijing\u2019s \u201cre-education\u201d and internment camps for Muslim Uighurs in China\u2019s Xinjiang province.\n\nAs a result, it has\n\nopened itself up\n\nto charges of hypocrisy. But for Khan, it is a strategic silence underpinned by economic reason.\n\nChinese investments have also come with another type of baggage. The Associated Press reported that\n\nmore than 600 Pakistani women\n\nhave fallen victim to trafficking networks after marrying Chinese men.\n\nGiven its own escalation with China, it is unsurprising that the US has been critical of CPEC.\n\nIn a\n\ndiscussion\n\nat the Atlantic Council on May 20, senior diplomat Alice Wells reiterated US concerns and argued Pakistan should attempt to renegotiate the terms of CPEC with China in light of the economic fallout caused by Covid-19, calling the lending terms \u201cpredatory, unsustainable, and unfair\u201d and calling out its lack of transparency.\n\nApart from being a counterweight to India and the US, Islamabad hopes for a number of tangible benefits in the near term from its close relationship with Beijing.\n\nOne is a favourable turn in Pakistan\u2019s status with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international watchdog that combats money laundering and terrorist financing. Pakistan has been on the\n\nFATF \u201cgreylist\u201d\n\nsince 2018, and a blacklisting would deal a major blow by reducing investment and growth capacity.\n\nWith China the FATF president since 2019, Pakistan hopes that it will be removed from the greylist as its status comes under review.\n\nStrategic considerations aside, the jury is still out on whether Pakistan will be able to reap the windfalls of Chinese investment. In the 5 years since the CPEC was established, there\u2019s little evidence of its ambitious and grand vision being realised.\n\nSource: TRT World\n\nRelated News\n\nIndia\u2019s division of Jammu and Kashmir angers China\n\nSlowly but surely, China is moving into Afghanistan\n\nHas Imran Khan charmed the Saudis into a more balanced relationship?\n\nBlast kills at least five at Pakistan mosque - police\n\nCategory News\n\nHow the UAE's espionage is aimed at destabilising Turkey\n\nIs MBS pressuring Saudi Arabian businesses to boycott Turkish goods?\n\nNorth Korea: Chinese yellow dust could bring Covid-19 into the country\n\nThe Mediterranean is under stress, needs urgent action, says a UN report\n\nPakistan\n\nAsia\n\nSouthern Asia\n\nchina\n\ncpec\n\nBACK\n\nIndia\u2019s division of Jammu and Kashmir angers China\n\nSlowly but surely, China is moving into Afghanistan\n\nHas Imran Khan charmed the Saudis into a more balanced relationship?\n\nBlast kills at least five at Pakistan mosque - police\n\nIs China's Belt and Road Initiative working?\n\nBACK\n\n1\n\nCroatia accused of physical and sexual assaults against refugees\n\n2\n\nHow Patani-Malay Muslims refuse to be swallowed by Thailand's mainstream\n\n3\n\nHow the UAE's espionage is aimed at destabilising Turkey\n\n4\n\nThe Mediterranean is under stress, needs urgent action, says a UN report\n\n5\n\nIs MBS pressuring Saudi Arabian businesses to boycott Turkish goods?\n\nBACK\n\nShow people, places and other topics in this story\n\nRead articles related to this story\n\nSee what's popular on TRT World\n\nCLOSE\n\nWhat would you like to learn?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words.

This new government is much more open to renewable\nenergy and wants to promote it\u201d he said.\n\nBabar said most of the new planned renewable power would be\nsolar or wind, divided roughly equally between the two\ntechnologies, and coming from everything from wind farms to\nrooftop solar.\n\n\"We already have more than 30 wind and solar plants in\noperation, all financed privately by local and international\nbanks, multilaterals and export credit agencies. New ones will\nbe financed the same way,\" he said.\n\nThe new renewables plan represents \"an ambitious target but\nachievable\", he said.\n\nProud of our efforts for a clean and green Pakistan to fight pollution and climate change.\n\npic.twitter.com/KV82wsTkTW\n\n\u2014 Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI)\n\nJuly 25, 2020\n\nInternational investors could put as much as $15 billion into the plan by 2030, Ashfaq predicted - though he cautioned that renewables investment would depend on clear government targets for its use, and growing demand for power as the country industrialises.\n\nGrowth in power demand has slowed over the past two years, with Pakistan's economy struggling even before the coronavirus pandemic hit in March, he said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nMore countries follow Imran Khan\u2019s lead in calling for debt relief\n\nPotential roadblock\n\nOne big potential roadblock to scaling renewables is the focus of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project on building new coal-fired power plants, Ashfaq said.\n\n\u201cNearly 70 percent of generation capacity of CPEC power projects is coal fired. With CPEC coal-power projects, coal-fired generation capacity will increase from 3 percent in 2017 to 20 percent in 2025,\" he said.\n\nAchieving the country's renewable energy aims will require rethinking those plans, he said.\n\nBut Babar said \"pre-authorised fossil fuel projects under CPEC will continue execution - they will go into construction\".\n\nThat suggests Pakistan will continue with plans to build all seven new CPEC coal-fired power plants by 2024.\n\nJafry, of the alternative energy board, however, said he believed the new renewables policy was \"achievable and realistic\", as it was linked to forecasts of Pakistan's energy demand through 2047.\n\nSource: Reuters\n\nRelated News\n\nJapan prime minister to visit Tehran, with energy security the main concern\n\nWhy do Arab members of OPEC resist Trump's oil policy?\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Pakistan\u2019s economy?\n\nSoaring prices, rising anger in Imran Khan's Pakistan\n\nCategory News\n\nUS Justice Department files landmark antitrust case against Google\n\nSweden bans Huawei, ZTE from upcoming 5G networks\n\nSubdued reactions as China's 4.9% growth in GDP weaker than expected\n\nIreland investigates how Facebook handles children's data on Instagram\n\nPakistan\n\nAsia\n\nSouthern Asia\n\nrenewable energy\n\nHydropower Capacity\n\nBACK\n\nJapan prime minister to visit Tehran, with energy security the main concern\n\nWhy do Arab members of OPEC resist Trump's oil policy?\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Pakistan\u2019s economy?\n\nSoaring prices, rising anger in Imran Khan's Pakistan\n\nPakistan to get $6B from IMF over the next three years\n\nBACK\n\n1\n\nUK signs post-Brexit trade deal with Japan\n\n2\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue agrees to guilty plea in opioid probe\n\n3\n\nNetflix falls short on new subscribers amid an array of competitors\n\n4\n\nSubdued reactions as China's 4.9% growth in GDP weaker than expected\n\n5\n\nUS Justice Department files landmark antitrust case against Google\n\nBACK\n\nShow people, places and other topics in this story\n\nRead articles related to this story\n\nSee what's popular on TRT World\n\nCLOSE\n\nWhat would you like to learn?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words.

The CDWP decided to defer evacuation of power from Dasu project because of some technical observation raised during the meeting so decision was taken to rectify the technical hitches and then the project will be cleared in next CDWP meeting, said the official sources.\n\nThe project is evacuation and transmission of power from 2160MW from Dasu Hydro Power Project to respective load centers and Discos by construction of 765kv double circuit transmission line from Dasu project to Islamabad through Mansehra. According to financial analysis, the life of the project has been assumed for 30 years and total cost of the project is estimated at Rs132.249 billion including interest during cost (IDC) of Rs13.709 billion. For financial analysis, the IDC has been excluded. The fixed use of system charges for at Rs176.13 per KW per month has been used. The transmission losses has been assumed at 3 percent. The CDWP meeting presided over by Deputy Chairman Planning Commission Mohammad Jehanzeb Khan considered three projects presented by KP government for energy sector with estimated cost of Rs122.128 billion.\n\nFirst project related to Energy namely \u201cHiring of Planning Consultants and management Support Consultants for Energy Sector Development and Institutional Strengthening under the World Bank Assisted KP Hydropower & Renewable Energy Development Programme\u201d worth Rs5775 million was approved in the meeting.\n\nThe objective of the project is to prepare plans, feasibility studies/design studies through Planning Consultants, Institutional Strengthening through Management Support Consultants and capacity building of PEDO/Energy & Power Department KP.\n\nSecond project of Energy Namely \u201cConstruction of 157MW Madian Hydropower Project, District Swat, under the World Bank assisted Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Hydropower & Renewable Energy Development Program (KPHREDP)\u201d worth Rs79798.00 million was referred to ECNEC for further approval. The main object of this project is to construct 157MW Madian Hydropower project on Swat River. The project will generate 767.59GWh of affordable energy annually to make a value addition in generation capacity in the power network of KP and the country.\n\nThe third project of Energy titled \u201cConstruction of 88MW Gabral Kalam hydropower project\u201d worth Rs36555.25 million was referred to ECNEC for further approval. The project will generate 339.19GWh of affordable energy annually to make a value addition in generation capacity in the power network of KP and in the country.\n\nThe CDWP also approved a project namely \u201cDisaster Climate Resilience Improvement Project AJK\u201d worth Rs. 3629.820 million which is also funded through WB share of $347 million. The forum also considered \u201cEvacuation of Power from 2160MW Dasu Hydropower Project (Stage-1)\u201d and \u201cPakistan Goes Global\u201d but these projects were not cleared due to technical observations, hence decided to be discussed in next meeting.\n\nLatest News\n\nMajor Royal Figures Refuse To Invite Meghan Markle And Prince Harry To Crucial Mexit Talks\n\nPrayer Timings In Pakistan: Namaz Time For Fajr, Zohar, Asr, Maghrib, Isha\n\nPrince Charles Accused Of Pursuing Camilla While Neglecting Prince Harry, William\n\nHira Mani Expresses Admiration For Russian MMA Fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov\n\nErtugrul's Abdur Rehman Alp Reprises His Role In 'Kurulus: Osman'\n\nDrake Extols Sacha Baron Cohen After 'Borat' Release\n\nAdventurous Shakira Relishes The Thrill Of Surfing On Rough Waves\n\nMeghan Markle Takes Away Prince Harry From Royal Family For Good?\n\nFATF Decision To Retain Pakistan On Grey List Came After EU Expressed Dissatisfaction\n\nBoxer Amir Khan's Home Visited By Police After A Call: Report\n\nFATF Keeps Pakistan In Grey List, Stresses Need To Do 'more'\n\nMore From Pakistan\n\nSHC restrains search committee from finalising names for FUUAST VC\n\nReport of immunity to CPEC Authority chairman misleading: ministry\n\nNon-existent Karachi civil war: Twitter slammed for ignoring Indian propaganda\n\nOver Rs 22m corruption: FIA arrests three USC employees\n\n\u2018Nawaz has no plan to stay in London for long\u2019\n\nPakistani Papa John\u2019s millionaire faces serious fraud inquiry\n\nWidow, boy assaulted\n\n18 injured in buses\u2019 collision in Toba Tek Singh\n\nPoor performance: 16 price control magistrates get show-cause notices\n\nCommits suicide\n\nSI among 8 booked for snatching accused from FIA\n\nCase registered against 150 people for attacking police\n\nClean Karachi campaign launched under aegis of PCIC\n\nDevelopment of Bundal, Buddo islands: Sindh PA resolution doesn\u2019t invalidate PIDA Ord\n\nLabourer electrocuted\n\nSaudi Arabia not opposing Pakistan on FATF issue, says Ashrafi\n", "date": "2020-08-20", "label": true, "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/703145-cdwp-approves-one-energy-project-recommends-three-to-ecnec"}

Since the region became a gateway for the multi-billion dollar CPEC, banks, investors, food chains are moving into the mountainous region.\n\n\"I have moved here [Gilgit] from Bangkok in April this year and invested a hefty sum because this city is the future business hub after the CPEC becomes fully operational,\" said Nasar, owner of Gems Gallery located in the beautiful city market.\n\nScores of people in the picturesque market in the city, which is about 600 kilometers (372 miles) from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad told Anadolu Agency that CPEC is turning a gamechanger and is changing their fortunes.\n\nThe $64 billion CPEC -- a network of roads, railways, and pipelines -- is aiming to connect China's strategically important northwestern Xinxiang province to the port of Gawadar in far away in Balochistan.\n\nWhile the corridor will give China easy access to Africa and the Mideast, it will make Pakistan earn billions of dollars and spur business activities along the road network replacing the fabled Silk Road.\n\nNasar, however, said while business prospects are fabulous, the weather plays a spoiler, referring to the harsh winter season from November to March when most of the areas get blocked by heavy snow.\n\nBeautiful valleys\n\nSpeaking to Anadolu Agency former Chief Minister of GB Hafiz Hafeezur Rehman said the government has developed the infrastructure to attract more tourists and investors over the past five years. He completed his five-year tenure on June 23.\n\nThe region hosts several beautiful valleys including Nagar, Hunza, Gilgit, Attaabad, Khaplu, Shiger, Gupis, Astore, and Skardu Valley thus attracts the local and foreign tourists in the summer season.\n\nOn the pattern of investments, Rehman said those who want to invest in dollars will have to come here though the Pakistan government and those who invest in local currency need to approach directly to the local authorities. He described the blocking of roads due to snowfall an impediment in the way of large investments.\n\nAccording to the officials, the region has great energy potential due to huge water resources. They believe that the region can generate over 50,000-megawatt electricity from water.\n\n\"We want to invite the Turkish companies to come and invest in the power sector,\" said the former chief minister.\n\nThe region is accessible through Karakoram and Kaghan-Naran highways. But the\n\nNaran-Babusar road, which connects Chillas district of GB, remaining close for six months during winter due to heavy snowfall.\n\nKarakoram Highway, a technological marvel\n\nThe local people use 784 km. (487 mi) Karakoram Highway in winter. The road is considered as the eighth wonder of the world due to its high elevation and crisscrossing highest mountains.\n\nCompleted in 20 years by Chinese and Pakistani engineers, as many as 1,000 people lost their lives during its construction. The road passes through extremely dangerous Rocky Mountains overlooking the fast-flowing Indus river, thousands of feet below.\n\nThe travelers here also witness the confluence of the three highest mountain ranges with Gilgit River melting into the Indus River at the same junction.\n\n\"This is a very beautiful location where you can see the three big empires [ world's highest mountains] meeting each other,\" said a tourist Adnan Chaudhary, who has arrived from Lahore, a city of northeastern Punjab province.\n\nDuring previous Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tenure 180 km (111.8 mi) Hazara Motorway linking the Burhan Interchange near Hasan Abdal in Punjab province with Thakot in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was constructed. The road has significantly reduced travel hours from capital Islamabad.\n\nBad road stretches\n\nHowever, the 136 km (84 mi) part of Karakoram highway from Thakot to Raikot, Gilgit Baltistan, is a hectic journey due to poor road conditions.\n\nRaikot town, is also the gateway to Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest mountain in the world with an altitude of 8,126 meters (26,660 feet).\n\n\"The previous prime minister Nawaz Sharif was approved 16 million rupees [ $95.4 million] for the Thakot to Raikot section of Karakoram Highway. The current government has withdrawn the funds, thus stopped the construction work,\" said Rehman.\n\nA tourist Shaistan Bahar said it took her 18-20 hours to reach Gilgit because of poor road conditions from Thakot to Raikot.\n\nMelting of glaciers\n\nBut what is worrying people in the region is the fast melting of glaciers, which often leads to flash floods in the region. Last year Pakistan had been ranked fifth on the list of countries vulnerable to climate change by the Global Climate Risk Index for 2020.\n\nThe Siachen Glaciers, known as the world's highest battlefield, are also located in the GB region, which includes the world's second-longest glaciers, stretching an impressive 76 km (47 mi).\n\nThese glaciers in GB are the main source of the famed Indus River, the main source of drinking water and irrigation downstream in Pakistan.\n\nPakistani meteorological reports in 2017 had warned that Himalayan glaciers have been shrinking for the past 30 years, with losses accelerating to alarming levels in the past decade.

(Xinhua/Zhai Jianlan)\n\nBEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping said Friday that as a landmark project under the Belt and Road Initiative, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is of great importance to promoting in-depth development of the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and forging a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future.\n\nXi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks in a verbal message to Pakistani President Arif Alvi.\n\nXi said he appreciates the fact that Alvi sent a congratulatory letter to the opening of the Second Conference of the CPEC Political Parties Joint Consultation Mechanism, which fully demonstrated that Alvi attaches great importance to and supports the China-Pakistan relationship and construction of the CPEC.\n\nChina and Pakistan are good brothers and partners who share special friendship, Xi said, adding that political parties from both sides often carry out friendly consultations and constantly build political consensus, which is conducive to steadily advancing the construction of the CPEC as well as high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.\n\nPhoto taken on Nov. 18, 2019 shows the expressway section from Havelian to Mansehra under the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Phase Two project in Pakistan's northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

We have endured the pain in the past when there was no such road, but now, traveling has become smooth, fast and pleasant,\" he added.\n\nAt a roadside fruit stall near his village of Lammi in Mansehra, 21-year-old college student Ehtisham sells apricots and peaches to travelers. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Pakistani government closed all educational institutes in the country, including Ehtisham's college in Abbottabad, located between Havelian and Mansehra.\n\n\"I was free at home. More people are coming because of the new road, so I decided to start this fruit business to help my family and also provide convenience for the travelers,\" Ehtisham said.\n\nPhoto taken on July 28, 2020 shows the secondary road section from Mansehra to Thakot under the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Phase Two project, in Pakistan's northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. (China Road and Bridge Corporation/Handout via Xinhua)\n\n\"I bought these fruits from a market in Mansehra, and used a vehicle to transport them here. The new road is excellent, very smooth, and no fruit got damaged during the trip,\" he added.\n\nEhtisham said the landscape in Pakistan's North is very beautiful, with lush green mountains and valleys, and he believes that more tourists will go there thanks to the new road.\n\nThe college student used to live in a hostel in Abbottabad, but now he plans to commute between his home and the college on a daily basis after the college reopens as the new road has made the journey much shorter.\n\nThe implementation of the road project also created job opportunities for more local people. \"The KKH Phase Two project employed over 10,000 local people at the peak of its construction and also trained a large amount of road-building professionals for Pakistan,\" Wand said.\n\nRISING TO THE CHALLENGE\n\nAccording to Wang, the construction of the new road from Mansehra to Thakot formally commenced in September 2016, while the 39-km-long four-lane expressway section was inaugurated in November 2019, and the 79-km-long two-lane secondary road section was inaugurated in July this year.\n\nAlong the way, the complex geological conditions and topography of Pakistan's mountainous northern region brought great challenges and difficulties to the construction of subgrade, tunnels and bridges.\n\n\"The areas along the KKH are called the museum of geohazards, because almost all kinds of geological disasters including earthquakes, landslides and rock-fall can be found here,\" Wang said.\n\nInstead of reconstructing and expanding the original road, the project's goal was to build a higher-category new road, which made the implementation even more challenging.\n\nPhoto taken on Nov. 18, 2019 shows the expressway section from Havelian to Mansehra under the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Phase Two project in Pakistan's northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. (Xinhua/Liu Tian)\n\nWhat's more, the unexpected pandemic brought further trouble. Wang said the project team implemented closed-off management in all project camps to cut off the transmission route of the virus.\n\nThough both the Chinese and Pakistani employees found themselves under a tighter schedule and facing more psychological pressure due to the pandemic, a new road measuring 10.7 km that snakes its way through mountains and valleys with six tunnels and 105 bridges had been put into use, said Wang, adding that \"not a single confirmed COVID-19 case had been found among the project's personnel so far.\"\n\nFRIENDSHIP ACROSS KARAKORAM\n\nIn Thakot, there is a bridge across the Indus River named Youyi Bridge, with \"youyi\" meaning \"friendship\" in Chinese.\n\nOn a monument next to the bridge, it is said that the bridge's name is \"in memory of those valiant Chinese and Pakistani engineers and workmen who sacrificed their lives during the construction of KKH (1966-1978) and (to) commemorate the friendship between Pakistan and China.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak ruined the plans of many Chinese personnel to return to China for vacation and enjoy family reunions. Among them was 33-year-old Ma Wei, manager of the secondary road section of the KKH Phase Two project, who came to Pakistan in 2016 soon after he got married.\n\n\"The time I have spent with my family has been less than half a year in the past four years. My wife planned to come to Pakistan from Beijing during (Chinese New Year) this year, and after that, we would go back to China together. We were even considering having a baby. But all of this had to be postponed due to COVID-19,\" Ma told Xinhua.\n\nPhoto taken on Nov. 18, 2019 shows the expressway section from Havelian to Mansehra under the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Phase Two project in Pakistan's northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. (Xinhua/Liu Tian)\n\nHowever, Ma said the \"Karakoram spirit\" provided him encouragement. \"The difficulties that the Chinese and Pakistani workmen faced when they built the KKH in the last century are unimaginable, and hundreds of them sacrificed their lives.\"\n\nFor the common target of building this road, many of the Pakistani personnel chose to stay with the Chinese team and continue to work during the closed-off management period.\n\nThat \"made me feel the uniqueness of the China-Pakistan friendship. When such a beautiful road was put into use, no matter what it has cost us, we feel everything is worthwhile,\" he added.\n\nBecause of the closed-off management measures, the last time that Yousuf Karim, who joined the project at the end of 2015 as an interpreter, went home was in February.\n\n\"Closing off the camps is necessary and effective to prevent COVID-19. We may get infected on the way back, so not going home is actually to protect my family,\" the 35-year-old father of two boys told Xinhua.\n\n\"Compared to our Chinese friends who left their families to come here to help us build this road and could not go back for a long time, what we endured is not a big deal,\" he added.\n\n\"If there is no road, it is meaningless to talk about development ... When China achieves development, it is also trying to help other countries, including Pakistan, to develop together,\" he said.\n\nDespite the spread of the coronavirus, none of the CPEC projects under construction and in operation have become stuck in stagnation, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing said.\n\nThe implementation of the projects, the diplomat added, will create job opportunities, and greatly help Pakistan mitigate the negative impact of the disease and bolster its economy.\n\n(Video reporters: Jiang Chao, Ali Jaswal, Tariq Hameed; Video editor: Zheng Xin)\n\nKEY WORDS:\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nEXPLORE XINHUANET\n\nNews\n\nChina\n\nWorld\n\nBusiness\n\nCulture Edu\n\nSports\n\nSci Tech\n\nHealth\n\nEntertainment\n\nRegions\n\nAsia & Pacific\n\nAmericas\n\nEurope\n\nAfrica\n\nOrganizations\n\nNorth America\n\nServices\n\nInvestment\n\nDoing Business\n\nWork in China\n\nStudy in China\n\nVisit in China\n\nLive in China\n\nEmergency\n\nWeather\n\nMore\n\nPhotos\n\nVideo\n\nIn-depth\n\nSpecial Reports\n\nCorrections\n\n010020070750000000000000011102121393082331\n\nwd_paramtracker(\"_wdxid=010020070750000000000000011102121393082331\")\n", "date": "2020-08-21", "label": true, "url": "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/21/c_139308233.htm"}

It has been turned back into a Mosque. 1st AZAAN after 8 decades took place today.\n\n#AyasofyaCamii\n\n#Turkey\n\nDoes It Again.

The agent cannot appoint lawyer in Pakistan without assistance from India, it read.\n\nOn July 2, 2020, Pakistan had decided to grant third consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav following his refusal to file review petition against his sentence.\n\nOn July 16, 2020, Indian Charge d\u2019affaires reached the Foreign Office as New Delhi accepted Pakistan\u2019s offer to give second consular access to Jadhav. The place where the agent was kept had been declared as sub-jail.\n\nForeign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said first consular access under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 was earlier provided by Pakistan on second September last year. She said the mother and wife of commander Jadhav were also allowed to meet him on December 25, 2017.\n\nAisha Farooqui said two consular officers of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad were provided unimpeded and uninterrupted consular access to Commander Jadhav.\n\nICJ rejects Indian plea for Jadhav\u2019s release\n\nOn July 17, 2019, the ICJ had rejected remedies sought by India, including annulment of military court decision convicting Kulbhushan Jadhav, his release and safe passage to India.\n\nAnnouncing the verdict Judge Abdulqavi Ahmed Yousaf told Pakistan to review the death sentence for an alleged Indian spy, saying Islamabad violated his rights to consular visits.\n\nThe court, in its verdict, rejected a number of Indian demands including annulment of military court decision convicting Jadhav, his release and safe passage to India.\n\nThe ICJ found that Pakistan deprived India of the right to communicate with and have access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, to visit him in detention and to arrange for his legal representation, and thereby breached obligations incumbent upon it under Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\n\nThe tribunal in The Hague ordered an \"effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav\".\n\nThe judge remarked that Pakistan and India are signatories of the Vienna Convention.\n\n\"A continued stay of execution constitutes an indispensable condition for the effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Mr Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav,\" it ruled.\n\nThe court while finding Jadhav guilty of committing terrorist activities inside Pakistan, ordered that the Indian spy cannot be handed over to India. Kulbhushan will remain in Pakistan\u2019s custody, it ruled.\n\nPakistani team headed by the attorney general was present in the courtroom. The team also included then Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal.\n\nJadhav\u2019s confession and trial\n\nGovernment arrested Jadhav alias Hussein Mubarak Patel in the province of Balochistan on charges of terrorism and spying for India\u2018s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).\n\nThe government stated that he was a serving commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on March 3, 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Mashkel, Balochistan. The Indian government recognized Jadhav as a former naval officer but denied any current links with him and maintained that he took premature retirement and was abducted from Iran.\n\nOn March 25, 2016, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released the confessional statement of Jadhav where he claimed to be a serving Indian Navy officer.\n\n\"By 2002, I commenced intelligence operations. In 2003, I established a small business in Chabahar in Iran,\" he admitted. \"As I was able to achieve undetected existence and visits to Karachi in 2003 and 2004. Having done some basic assignments within India for RAW, I was picked up by RAW in 2013 end\".\n\nHe said his purpose was to meet Baloch insurgents and carry out \"activities with their collaboration\".\n\nOn April 8, 2017, ISPR lodged a first information report (FIR) against him whereas on April 11, 2017, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa had confirmed death sentence of Jadhav who was tried through Field General Court Martial (FGCM) under Pakistan Army Act (PAA). He was tried under section 59 of Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 and Section III of official Secret Act of 1923.\n\nFGCM found Kulbushan SudhirYadhav guilty of all the charges. He confessed before a Magistrate and the Court that he was tasked by RAW to plan, coordinate and organize espionage and sabotage activities aiming to destabilize and wage war against Pakistan by impeding the efforts of Law Enforcement Agencies for restoring peace in Balochistan and Karachi.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denying consular access to Jadhav.\n\nOn May 18, 2017, the ICJ stayed the execution pending the final judgment on the case and even on July 13, 2018, ICJ stayed Kulbhushan Jadhav\u2019s execution in Pakistan.\n\nOn June 22, 2017, Jadhav gave a second confessional statement where he confessed to carrying out subversive activities in Balochistan.\n\nOn Feb 22, 2019, ICJ reserved its judgment in Jadhav case whereas they are going to rule the verdict today on July 17, 2019.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nGIKI graduates develop Pakistan's first real-time online shopping search engine\n\n30-04-2020\n\nAlamgir Welfare Trust - A beacon of hope amidst coronavirus pandemic\n\n04-04-2020\n\nEFU Life launches 'Humrahi' season 2 with unique message of future planning\n\n21-11-2019\n\nfoodpanda launches in Bahawalpur\n\n25-07-2019\n\nRecent articles\n\nIHC to hear govt plea seeking legal representative for Kulbhushan Jadhav on Aug 3\n\nPakistan has to comply with decisions of ICJ, requirements of FATF: Senate informed\n\nIndian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav not pardoned, Farogh Naseem tells NA\n\nKulbhushan Jadhav granted right to appeal by ICJ: Foreign Office spokesman\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLatest Videos\n\nWatch: What Farogh Naseem has to say regarding Justice Qazi Faez Esa verdict\n\nTayyip Erdogan confirms testing of Russian-ma...\n\nJaw dropping moment: Daredevil jump from clif...\n\nKP assembly passes resolution condemning Nawa...\n\nSC issues detailed verdict on Justice Qazi Fa...\n\nPrograms\n\nHealth\n\nGermany finds five new African swine fever cases in wild boar\n\nFDA approves first COVID-19 drug: antiviral remdesivir\n\nSmog can intensify coronavirus pandemic in Pakistan: Health experts\n\nRisk of inflight spread of COVID-19 'very low', not zero: WHO\n\nDo I need to wear a mask if I\u2019m 6 feet away from others?\n\nRegulators, experts take up thorny vaccine study issues\n\nDunya Blog\n\nThe Plague of Materialism and Our Well-being!\n\nEntrepreneurship in Pakistan: Gulf between Dreams and Realities!\n\nKnow The Story Of The \u201cPrincess Of Hope\u201d Standing In The Desert Of Balochistan!\n\nNews\n\nHeadline\n\nPakistan\n\nWorld\n\nSports\n\nCricket\n\nBusiness\n\nEntertainment\n\nTechnology\n\nCrime\n\nWeird News\n\nNews Archive\n\nPrograms\n\nDunya Kamran Khan Kay Sath\n\nDunya TV Special\n\nHasb-e-Haal\n\nIkhtalafi Note\n\nIlm-O-Hikmat\n\nMazaq Raat\n\nNuqta E Nazar\n\nOn The Front\n\nPeyam-E-Subh\n\nSawal Awam Ka\n\nThink Tank\n\nVoice of Dunya\n\nTools\n\nLive Streaming\n\nRadio\n\nDunya UK Transmission\n\nMobile apps\n\nSubscribe For News Letter\n\nCorporate\n\nFeedback\n\nDistribution\n\nContact Us\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nJoin Us\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nSponsor ad\n\nHome\n\nFeedback\n\nDistribution\n\nContact Us\n\nNews Archive\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.

The STA news agency says most have been imported cases.\n\nSlovenia has reported around 1,500 cases while 109 people have died.\n\n___\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n\u2014 China\u2019s new outbreak wanes as US calls for answers on virus\n\n\u2014 Is it safe to stay in hotels as reopenings get underway?\n\n\u2014 Study ties blood type to COVID-19 risk; O may help, A hurt\n\n\u2014 Vice President Mike Pence says the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic is \u201ca cause for celebration,\u201d but a  new poll finds more than half of Americans calling it fair or poor. The Gallup and West Health survey out Thursday shows that 57% of U.S. adults rate the national response to COVID-19 as fair or poor, particularly because America has the world\u2019s most expensive health care system. The poll found that only 23% rate the national response as excellent or very good, while an additional 20% rate it as good.\n\n\u2014 As work on potential coronavirus vaccines  intensifies, rich countries are placing advance orders for the inevitably limited supply to guarantee their citizens are immunized first. That is leaving significant questions about whether developing countries will get any vaccine before the pandemic ends.\n\n\u2014 U.S. health regulators are issuing warnings to three companies selling at-home blood tests for coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration said the tests are illegal because they haven\u2019t been federally reviewed to safely and accurately detect COVID-19. No tests are FDA-approved for consumers to test themselves at home.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\n___\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:\n\nLONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization\u2019s top scientist says it\u2019s now been definitively proven that the cheap malaria drug hydroxychloroquine \u2014 the drug favoured by President Donald Trump \u2014 doesn\u2019t work in stopping deaths among people hospitalized with the new coronavirus.\n\nBut Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said there could still be a role for the drug in preventing people from catching COVID-19 in the first place and noted that clinical trials testing hydroxychloroquine\u2019s role in this are ongoing.\n\nSwaminathan said in a press briefing on Thursday that there is still a gap in determining whether hydroxychloroquine has a role at all in prevention or minimizing the severity of the illness in early infection or even in preventing it.\n\nShe says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know that as yet. And we need to complete those large trials and get the data,\u201d she said, referring to several other trials not being conducted by WHO.\n\nThe U.N. health agency announced this week that it is suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its own trial testing various experimental therapies for COVID-19, referring to previous results from a large U.K. trial and a separate analysis of evidence on the drug. The other drugs being tested by WHO, including treatments used in the past for Ebola and AIDS, are still being pursued.\n\n___\n\nHONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong Disneyland has officially reopened after a major drop in coronavirus cases in the Chinese territory.\n\nAdvance reservations will be required and only limited attendance will be allowed at the park, one of the pillars of Hong Kong\u2019s crucial tourism industry.\n\nSocial distancing measures including avoiding mixing together different families are being implemented in lines, at restaurants, on rides and at shops, while cleaning and disinfecting will be increased.\n\nVisitors will have their temperatures checked at the entrance and be required to wear masks at all times inside the park, except when eating and drinking.\n\nHong Kong, a city of 7.5 million, has recorded just 1,120 cases and four deaths from COVID-19, but the impact on the financial hub\u2019s economy that relies heavily on international travel and visitors from China has been severe.\n\nMost visitors from outside the territory are still barred from entering and Disneyland said anyone who has traveled outside Hong Kong within the previous two weeks will be asked to rescheduled their visit.\n\n___\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh \u2014 Bangladesh\u2019s coronavirus cases crossed 100,000 on Thursday as the country reported another 3,803 confirmed infections and 38 more deaths.\n\nThe death toll from the virus reached 1,343 and the total number of infections stood at 102,292.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a meeting with top bureaucrats and advisers Thursday reviewed the situation and discussed steps to fight COVID-19 in the South Asian nation, including the continuing procurement of medical supplies.\n\n___\n\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 African nations next week will hold a high-level conference on coronavirus vaccines to \u201cposition ourselves to not be left behind\u201d in access, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief says.\n\nJohn Nkengasong says the World Health Organization director-general will attend the discussion that also will focus on \u201chow we can manufacture a vaccine ourselves.\u201d\n\nHe said countries including Senegal, Egypt and South Africa already have vaccine manufacturing capabilities.\n\nConcern has been high among Africa\u2019s 54 nations about access to testing and medical supplies amid intense global competition.\n\nAfrica\u2019s virus cases are now above 260,000, with South Africa representing about 30% of infections.\n\nMore than 3.7 million tests for the virus have been conducted in Africa, where the WHO has said the pandemic is \u201caccelerating\u201d on the continent of 1.3 billion people. Ten African nations account for about 80% of testing, while the rest are \u201cstill struggling,\u201d Nkengasong said.\n\n___\n\nPRAGUE \u2014 The Czech Republic is set to almost fully abandon its most visible tool of fighting the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 face masks.\n\nHealth Minister Adam Vojtech says that starting July 1, wearing masks on public transport and indoors such as in stores, theaters and cinemas is no longer mandatory.\n\nVojtech says masks will remain mandatory only in regions with local clusters and outbreaks. Those places will be determined later in June.\n\nCurrently, they include the capital of Prague and two eastern regions.\n\nThe country has registered several dozen new COVID-19 cases daily for a month while a total of 333 people have died.\n\n___\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The ex-president of Kazakhstan is infected with the new coronavirus.\n\nHis spokespeople say Nursultan Nazarbayev, 79, tested positive for the virus and remains in isolation. \u201cThere are no reasons for concern,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNazarbayev, who had ruled Kazakhstan since its independence in 1991, stepped down last year but continues to wield considerable influence as chair of the country\u2019s Security Council and leader of the ruling party Nur Otan.\n\nKazakhstan has reported 15,877 confirmed cases of the virus and 97 deaths among its population of 18 million. The ex-Soviet nation lifted the state of emergency declared on March 16, but various lockdown restrictions remain in place in different regions of the vast country.\n\n___\n\nPODGORICA, Montenegro \u2014 Montenegro is reporting a resurgence of the coronavirus in the small Balkan country that had no infections for weeks.\n\nMontenegrin health authorities said late Wednesday they have registered seven new cases after two more were confirmed earlier this week.\n\nA country of some 620,000 people, Montenegro imposed strict lockdown measures during the outbreak. Montenegro recently started reopening, hoping to attract tourists to the Adriatic coast.\n\n___\n\nISTANBUL \u2014 Turkish authorities have made the wearing of masks mandatory in three major cities to curb the spread of COVID-19 following an uptick in cases since the country allowed many businesses to reopen.\n\nThe governors of Istanbul, Ankara and Bursa announced the mask rule late Wednesday in line with a recommendation by the country\u2019s scientific advisory council. Masks are obligatory in 47 out of 81 provinces. The statements said masks must be worn in all public spaces.\n\nTurkey is seeing an upward trend in the daily number of infections after the government authorized cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen, lifted inter-city travel restrictions and eased stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June.\n\nTurkey has reported 182,727 confirmed cases and 4,861 deaths from COVID-19 since March.\n\n___\n\nATHENS, Greece \u2014 Greek civil protection authorities have imposed a seven-day complete lockdown on a community in northeastern Greece, after a spike in coronavirus cases there over the past week.\n\nResidents of the Echinos community in the province of Xanthi are forbidden from leaving the area, and are under a 24-hour curfew. They can leave their homes only to buy food or medication, and must wear a mask.\n\nOnly vehicles resupplying food stores and pharmacies are allowed into Echinos, while all other retail businesses have been shut.\n\nThe community has been the source of a localized outbreak before too. Authorities said the area had registered 73 new coronavirus cases and four deaths over the past week. Health officials are intensifying testing in the area.\n\nGreece had imposed a lockdown early and has managed to maintain deaths and serious illness from the coronavirus at low levels. On Wednesday, the country announced 55 new cases, the highest daily number for weeks The vast majority were in Xanthi.\n\nGreece has had a total of 187 deaths and just over 3,200 confirmed cases in the country of nearly 11 million people.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING \u2014 A Beijing government spokesman says the city has recorded a total of 158 confirmed cases since the new outbreak was detected last week at a large wholesale market.\n\nHu Hejian says close contacts are being traced to locate all possible cases as quickly as possible amid strengthened testing and other prevention and control measures.\n\nAnyone who has been near the Xinfad market since May 30, along with their close contacts, will be quarantined at home for 14 days and tested at least twice, said city government official Zhang Ge.\n\nBeijing reported 21 cases Thursday, down from 31 a day earlier.\n\nBeijing has barred entry to all confirmed and suspected cases, patients with fever and close contacts from abroad and other provinces, Zhang said. China also has barred most foreigners from entering and even foreign diplomats arriving from abroad must undergo two weeks of home quarantine.\n\nAll indoor public venues remain closed, Zhang said. Offices, restaurants and hotels in high risk area also will be shut down, he said.\n\n___\n\nNEW DELHI: India recorded the highest one-day spike of 12,281 coronavirus cases, raising the total to 366,946 even as the government ruled out reimposing a countrywide lockdown.\n\nIndia\u2019s death toll reached 12,237, a rise of 334 in the past 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The number of recoveries touched 52% at 194,325.\n\nIndia stands behind the United States, Brazil and Russia in the number of cases.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday rejected media reports that the government was considering reimposing lockdown. India has to think about further unlocking, minimizing all possibilities of harm to people, he said.\n\nThe March 25 lockdown is now restricted to high-risk areas.\n\nThe worst-hit states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi.\n\n___\n\nISLAMABAD \u2014 Pakistan has reported 5,358 new coronavirus cases, pushing infections in the Middle East beyond 1 million.\n\nCases in Pakistan have been spiraling in recent weeks, crossing 160,000 on Thursday even as Prime Minister Imran Khan has resisted pleas from medical professionals and the World Health Organization to reimpose a strict lockdown for at least two weeks.\n\nKhan says a countrywide lockdown would devastate an already crumbling economy and hurt the poorest with unemployment expected to near 7 million. Economists say Pakistan\u2019s poverty rate of 30% has increased to 40% since the first lockdown was imposed in mid-March.\n\nKhan\u2019s critics say a series of missteps has worsened the epidemic in Pakistan, beginning with his refusal to shut down mosques, particularly in April and May during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan followed by Eid-al Fitr, a holiday that brought millions of Pakistanis into overcrowded markets.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 59 COVID-19 cases as infections steadily rise in the capital area where half the country\u2019s 51 million people live.\n\nThe figures announced Thursday by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bring the national caseload to 12,257, including 280 deaths.\n\nThe agency says 39 of the new cases are in Seoul and the surrounding region, where authorities are trying to stem transmissions amid increased economic activity and eased attitudes on social distancing.\n\nEight new cases were linked to international arrivals. Officials are concerned the resurgence of the virus in China could bring more imported cases. South Korea has tied at least 1,379 cases to international arrivals and is requiring two-week quarantines on all passengers arriving from abroad.\n\n___\n\nCANBERRA, Australia \u2014 The two universities in Australia\u2019s capital plan to fly in 350 foreign students as the country\u2019s international education sector reopens after the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nAustralian National University and Canberra University said Thursday they expect the chartered aircraft to fly to Canberra from Singapore in late July.\n\nPriority will be given to students involved in research that can\u2019t be done online. The students will be quarantined at a hotel for two weeks. They are likely to be the first foreign students to return to Australian campuses since the lockdown.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB he supports the universities\u2019 plan. Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham says it\u2019s likely Australia won\u2019t allow general international travel before next year.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s capital has reported a decline in newly confirmed coronavirus cases as the city continues to press stricter measures to contain a new outbreak.\n\nBeijing reported 21 cases Thursday, down from 31 a day earlier.\n\nOfficials reported 28 new cases in all nationwide.

(Shemaroo/Youtube)\n\nMughal-e-Azam is a larger-than-life epic that can easily be considered an important chapter for cinema-lovers. The magnum opus, directed by K Asif, is still a captivating watch, 60 years since its release in 1960. Gifted actors such as Prithiviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Madhubala became synonymous with their onscreen personas - Akbar, Salim and Anarkali.\n\nSalim and Anarkali, who play star-crossed lovers, in this\n\nfeature film\n\n, also became the flag-bearers of unfinished love stories, or tragic romances in Bollywood, so to speak. The chemistry between then-real-life couple, Dilip Kumar and Madhubala unravelled beautifully on screen through Salim and Anarkali.\n\nAlthough Mughal-e-Azam revolves around the love story of Salim and Anarkali, maintains its focus on Emperor Akbar. The film even being named after the strong historical character. The film\u2019s screenplay is based on the play called Anarkali written by Imtiaz Ali \u2018Taj\u2019, in 1922 and rewritten in 1931. The intriguing story takes place in Lahore and is woven around the growing love between a servant girl and the crown prince. The offended emperor puts an end to this love story by ordering Anarkali to be buried alive in four walls (of a dungeon). This end scene was, however, changed in the film as the reviews from the preview came back negative hinting at the thought at should Anarkali indeed be buried alive, it would make the emperor the ultimate villain in film history.\n\nAt the time of its release in 1960, the film had an all-India release in 150 theatres simultaneously. A digitally-colourised version of the epic re-released in theatres in 2004, bringing out the beautiful colours of the places it was shot in, especially the classic song of a rebel in love, Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya, and the shots of Sheesh Mahal.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nThe cinema classic celebrates its 60th anniversary this week with director K Asif\u2019s son Akbar Asif presenting the screenplay of the film to the Oscars library in Hollywood.\n\nAkbar Asif, the UK-based son of the late director, said he presented the screenplay to the Academy Awards to mark the big anniversary of his father\u2019s historical epic.\n\nThree versions of the legendary screenplay \u2013 in Hindi, Roman text and English translation \u2013 are now available at the Margaret Herrick Library, a world-renowned reference and research collection of the Academy devoted to the history and development of the motion picture as an art form and an industry.\n\n\u201cThe journey of Mughal-e-Azam started with words from the greatest writing team ever assembled in Hindi cinema and I thought the best way to honour them was to permanently preserve their screenplay in the world\u2019s most renowned film library,\u201d said Akbar Asif, a businessman based in London.\n\n\u201cI hope future generations can learn and get inspired by the work of my late father and his incredible team of writers. I want to humbly thank the Academy Awards for accepting the screenplay,\u201d he said.\n\nThe screenplay of the film, which hit the screens in India on August 5, 1960, was crafted by a team comprising Aman, Kamal Amrohi, Wajahat Mirza, Ehsan Rizvi as well as director K. Asif.\n\nIn 2013, to mark the 100th anniversary of Indian cinema, it was declared the greatest Bollywood film ever made.

Amir Afzal, the receptionist at Akbar International Hotel where Sheikh and Pearl met, also identified the accused during an identity parade, he said.\n\n\"There were a lot of things going on behind the scenes,\" Naek said, when the court asked where the conspiracy had taken place. When Sheikh met the journalist, he used the name Bashir, Naek said, adding that he gave a fake name because his intentions were not pure.\n\n\"It is possible that the decision to kill was taken a few moments before it actually occurred,\" remarked Justice Yahya Afridi. Naek replied that the initial plan was to collect ransom, not assassinate the journalist.\n\nThe court also questioned how charges against Sheikh were proven when the body was never found and an autopsy was never conducted.\n\n\"Kidnapping charges were proven. The SHC should have ordered a retrial instead of overturning the death sentence,\" the Sindh government's lawyer replied.\n\nWhen asked by the court who identified the accused, Naek reiterated that the taxi driver had identified him during an identity parade.\n\n\"The taxi driver's statement is the basis for the government's case,\" remarked Justice Qazi Amin. \"His body was never found so how did the taxi driver identify Pearl,\" asked the judge.\n\n\"He identified him after looking at a picture,\" the lawyer replied.\n\nThe accused were acquitted on charges of murder and kidnapping for ransom, observed Justice Qazi Amin. \"It looks like the high court wrapped up the matter after giving punishment only for the crime of kidnapping,\" he remarked.\n\nBarring authorities from releasing Sheikh and others, and issuing notices to the parties concerned, the court adjourned the hearing until Wednesday.\n\nEarlier in the month, the apex court had\n\nreferred\n\nthe appeals against overturning the main accused's death sentence to Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed with a request to fix the hearing within two weeks as his 30-day detention under the anti-terrorism law will end on Sept 30 (Wednesday).\n\nA three-judge bench of the apex court comprising Justice Mushir Alam, Justice Manzoor Ahmed Malik and Justice Qazi Amin Ahmed had requested the CJP that if the appeals were fixed before the bench considering urgency of the matter, it could be heard for the entire day and decided.\n\nThe urgency concerns the expiry of Sheikh's detention period under Section 11 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, which will expire on Sept 30. The convict had previously been detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).\n\nPearl was doing research on religious extremism when he was kidnapped in Karachi in January 2002. Next month a video showing his decapitation was delivered to the US consulate, followed by the arrest of Sheikh, a Pakistani British, who was later sentenced to death by a trial court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nrender('div-gpt-ad-1539321627240-0')\n\nRelated Stories\n\nSC refers appeals in Pearl case to CJP for early decision\n\nOmar Saeed Sheikh \u2014 from rowdy student to terror convict\n\nComment: Daniel Pearl\u2019s murderers can\u2019t be allowed to escape justice\n\nFacebook Count\n\nTwitter Share\n\nEmail\n\nYour Name\n\n*\n\nRecipient Email\n\n*\n\n6\n\nAdvertisement\n\nrender('div-gpt-ad-1455520357400-4')\n\nAdvertisement\n\nrender('div-gpt-ad-1455520357400-2')\n\nRead more\n\nSC refers appeals in Pearl case to CJP for early decision\n\nOmar Saeed Sheikh \u2014 from rowdy student to terror convict\n\nComment: Daniel Pearl\u2019s murderers can\u2019t be allowed to escape justice\n\nSponsored\n\nInfinix is reshaping the smartphone experience in Pakistan with its latest offerings.

None of the pilot licences are fake, rather the matter has been misconstrued and incorrectly highlighted in the media/social media,\" Dawn news reported on Thursday citing CAA Director General Hassan Nasir Jamy as saying in a letter dated July 13.\n\nThe letter was addressed to Mubarak Saleh Al Gheilani, the acting DG of Civil Aviation Regulation, Muscat, Oman, in response to his July 2 letter and July 9 email with regard to safety concerns over licences of Pakistani pilots working with his country's airline.\n\nJamy, who is also the secretary of aviation division, told the Omani official that the CAA had already verified/cleared \"96 Pakistani pilots out of 104 names received from various civil aviation authorities/foreign airlines (UAE/GACA, Vietnam Airlines, Bahrain Air, Civil Aviation Malaysia, Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and Turkish Airlines)\".\n\nLast month, while furnishing before the National Assembly a preliminary report on the May 22 Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane crash in Karachi, Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan had claimed that 40 per cent of the country's pilots held \"fake licences\".\n\nHe later said that 262 airlines' pilots had falsified their credentials and of them 141 belonged to the PIA, nine from Air Blue and 10 from Serene Air.\n\nThe remaining pilots were affiliated with flying clubs, chartered plane services or foreign airlines, he said.\n\nThe CAA suspended the licences of only 34 pilots of the PIA and issued them a show-cause notice to explain as to how they performed flying duty and appeared in a written exam on a same date.\n\nThe issue of \u2018fake' licences drew world attention after the aviation minister's statement last month and the European Union Air Safety Agency suspended PIA authorisation to operate to the EU member states for six months, while the International Air Transport Association (IATA) also shared its concern over the serious lapse in the licensing and safety oversight by the aviation regulator, Dawn news reported.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation had also revoked permission for the PIA to conduct charter flights to America.\n\n--IANS\n\nksk/\n\nLatest Features\n\nBJP promises COVID vaccine to voters in Bihar!\n\nPM Modi suggests water from air idea!\n\nPaid to watch news channels?\n\nAtal Tunnel inaugurated!\n\nNo Data\n\nAbout Us\n\nBuy Domains\n\nBuy Skype Credit\n\nData Center Cloud\n\nCloud Applications\n\nTelecom Network\n\nHosting Cloudinfinit\n\nMPLS VPN Network\n\nApplication Services\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCareers\n\nFeedback\n\nAdvertise\n\nDigital\n\nSitemap\n\n\u00a9 Copyright\n\nSify Technologies Ltd\n\n, 1998-2020.

The siege of the Kashmiris and the violations of their human rights continued unabated even during COVID-19. She called on international community to prevail upon India to lift military siege in IIOJ&K and to hold India accountable for its illegal actions.\r\n\tFormer Foreign Secretary Mr. Salman Bashir said the Kashmiri people had been incarcerated in their homes in a year-long captivity by a million Indian troops and being subjected to the worse kind of oppression. He urged the US Government and people to speak up against tyranny and the folly of India\u2019s brutal colonial conduct. He said America as an icon of freedom and human rights must assert its moral authority to hold India to account for its policies and practices in Kashmir that are akin to genocide. The US had supported the Kashmiris and many congressmen have spoken out for the cause of justice in Kashmir. He warned that if left unchecked the Kashmiri cauldron could trigger explosions and destroy the peace of the region, and spark wider conflagrations of global magnitude.\r\n\tMr. Ijaz Haider spoke at length about the illegal Indian actions and India\u2019s attempt at the settler \u2013 colonial project of India which claims to be a democracy but whose defining feature is a Hindutva \u2013 driven exclusionary state. He said the international community must be made aware that Indian action of 5th August 2019 was illegal as a disputed territory could not be annexed.   \r\n\tOther speakers also called out the Indian extremist government for denying the people of IIOJ&K their basic human rights. Mr. Thakur said India\u2019s long and cruel occupation had brought unimaginable suffering to the people. He said Indian illegal action of 5th August 2019, accompanied by a huge security clampdown in the occupied territory, a communications blackout, and an excruciating curfew and deployment of additional troops had turned IIOJ&K into world\u2019s biggest open-air prison. \r\n\tDr. Asif Rehman said the road to peace in South Asia goes through Kashmir and the issue must be resolved to avoid conflict between two nuclear armed neighbours. \r\n\tAmbassador Dr. Asad M. Khan, in his concluding remarks, gave an overview of the egregious violations of the human rights of the Kashmiri since 5th August 2019 by the Indian regime. He stressed the need to further educate the people on the ongoing situation in Kashmir. He said the consistent efforts of Kashmiri and Pakistani community in the US had resulted in congressional hearings on Kashmir. The Ambassador drew attention to the extremist Hindu government\u2019s decision to demolish Babri Mosque and inaugurate Ram Temple on the first anniversary of 5th August 2019. He reaffirmed Pakistan\u2019s position to seek peaceful resolution of Kashmir dispute and reiterated the strong resolve of the government and people of Pakistan to continue extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri brethren.   \r\n\tThe webinar was watched by a large number of people through live broadcast on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n*-*-*-*\n\nPREVIOUS\n\nNEXT\n\nABOUT US\n\nPress Information Department is the principal department of Ministry of Information, Broadcasting, National History and Literary Heritage headed by Principal Information officer (PIO).

Following his duties as the Inspecting Officer and in tribute to the 75th anniversary of Victory in Japan, the minister laid a wreath in Chapel Square, toured the Indian Army Memorial Room and spoke with a number of the international cadets. Like so many other Covid-19 related aspects affecting society, this sovereign\u2019s parade has had to adapt to comply with the guidelines laid down by the government. The commissioning cadets have been restricted to inviting only two guests so as to ensure the strict social distancing policy is upheld, the cadets marched on and performed their drill movements in open order to maintain their distancing, then finally and unusually for the Sovereign\u2019s Parade there was only two divisions on parade instead of the three \u2013 the junior division having started later in the year due to lockdown are not ready to take to the famous parade square in front of Old College.\n\nOnce the commissioning cadets made that symbolic march up the steps of Old College followed by the Academy\u2019s Adjutant atop his horse, they will need to wait a little longer, the point at which they commission will be at the stroke of midnight.\n\nAmong the 213 Officer Cadets commissioning will be 37 international cadets from 24 countries as far afield as Paraguay, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nLatest News\n\nFM Qureshi Cautions Against India's Bid To Take Pakistan Back To ICJ\n\nBrad Pitt's Darling Nicole Poturalski Leaving 'no Stone Unturned' To Fascinate Him\n\nWill Speak To Boris Johnson If Need Arises To Have Nawaz Deported: PM Imran Khan\n\nEsra Bilgic Aka Halime Sultan's Smashing Looks Will Leave You Spellbound: See Pics\n\nFATF Keeps Pakistan In Grey List, Stresses Need To Do 'more'\n\nBorat Gave Tom Hanks Coronavirus?\n\nReference Filed Against Justice Qazi Faez Isa 'in Wanton Disregard Of The Law': Supreme Court\n\nBody Language Expert Claims Meghan Markle Still Controls Prince Harry In LA\n\nScarlett Johansson Gears Up To Delight Fans With Her Talents In 'Bride'\n\nPrince William To \u2018unleash\u2019 His Wrath\u2019 Atop Prince Charles Over \u2018failing To Live Up To Royal Role\u2019\n\nWatch: Melania Trump 'yanks' Hand Away From Donald Trump's After US Election 2020 Debate\n\nMore From Top Story\n\nEx-governor Raja Saroop dies at 88\n\nState of anxiety throughout country: Fazl\n\nGovt fixes wheat production-target at 26.78m ton for Rabi season\n\nEmirati woman in UAE-Israel flag photo speaks up\n\nProtests against illegal detention of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman continue: London protest demands release of Jang/Geo Editor-in-Chief\n\nImran, Bhutanese counterpart discuss corona, other issues\n\nNo Saudi anti-Pakistan vote in FATF plenary\n\nKh Asif appears before NAB\u2019s team in \u2018Aqama\u2019 inquiry\n\nDivisions within PML-N?

Trump has dropped\n\nmore bombs\n\nand missiles than George W.\n\nBush or Barack Obama\n\ndid in their first terms, and there are still roughly as many US bases and troops overseas as when he was elected.\n\nTrump routinely talks up both sides of every issue, and the corporate media still judge him more by what he says (and tweets) than by his actual policies. So it isn't surprising that he is still trying to confuse the public about his aggressive war policy. But Trump has been in office for nearly three and a half years, and he now has a record on war and peace that we can examine.\n\nSuch an examination makes one thing very clear: Trump has come closer to starting new wars with North Korea, Venezuela, and Iran than to ending any of the wars he inherited from Obama. His first-term record shows Trump to be just another warmonger in chief.\n\nA Bloody Inheritance\n\nFirst, let's look at what Trump inherited. At the end of the Cold War, US political leaders promised Americans a \"peace dividend,\" and the Senate Budget Committee embraced a proposal to cut the US military budget\n\nby 50 percent\n\nover the next ten years. Ten years later,\n\nonly 22 percent\n\nin savings were realized, and the George W. Bush administration used the terrorist crimes of September 11 to justify illegal wars, systematic war crimes, and an extraordinary one-sided arms race in which the United States accounted for 45 percent of global\n\nmilitary spending\n\nfrom 2003 to 2011. Only half this $2 trillion\n\nspending surge\n\n(in 2010 dollars) was related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the US Navy and Air Force quietly cashed in a trillion-dollar wish list of new warships, warplanes, and high-tech weapons.\n\nPresident Barack Obama entered the White House with a\n\npledge\n\nto bring home US troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, and to shrink the US military footprint, but his presidency was a triumph of symbolism over substance. He won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize based on a few speeches, a lot of wishful thinking, and the world's desperate hopes for peace and progress. But by the time Obama stepped down\n\nin 2017\n\n, he had dropped more bombs and missiles on more countries than Bush did, and had spent even more than Bush on weapons and war.\n\nThe major shift in US war policy under Obama was to reduce politically sensitive US troop casualties by transitioning from large-scale military occupations to mass bombing, shelling, and covert and proxy wars. While Republicans derisively dubbed Obama's doctrine \"leading from behind,\" this was a transition that was already underway in Bush's second term, when he committed the United States to\n\ncompletely withdraw\n\ning its occupation troops from Iraq by the end of 2011.\n\nObama's defenders, like Trump's today, were always ready to absolve him of responsibility for war crimes, even as he killed thousands of civilians in\n\nair strikes\n\nin Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria and\n\ndrone strikes\n\nin Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, including the gratuitous assassination of an\n\nAmerican teenager\n\nin Yemen. Obama launched a new war to destroy Libya, and the United States'\n\ncovert role\n\nin the war in Syria was similar to its role in Nicaragua in the 1980s, for which, despite its covert nature, the International Court of Justice\n\nconvicted\n\nthe United States of aggression and ordered it to pay reparations.\n\nMany senior US military and civilian officials deserve a share of the guilt for America's systematic crimes of aggression and other war crimes since 2001, but the principle of\n\ncommand responsibility\n\n, recognized from the Nuremberg principles to the US Uniform Code of Military Justice, means that the commander in chief of the US armed forces, the president of the United States, bears the heaviest criminal responsibility for these crimes under US and international law.\n\nIs Trump Different?\n\nIn\n\nJanuary 2017\n\n, as Donald Trump prepared to take office, US forces in Iraq conducted their heaviest month of aerial bombardment since the \"shock and awe\" bombing during the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. This time, the enemy was the Islamic State (IS), a group spawned by the US invasion of Iraq and Obama's\n\ncovert support\n\nfor Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria. Iraqi forces captured East Mosul from the Islamic State on January 24, and in February, they began their assault on West Mosul, bombing and shelling it even more heavily until they captured the ruined city in July. A Kurdish Iraqi\n\nintelligence report\n\nrecorded that more than forty thousand civilians were killed in the US-led destruction of Mosul.\n\nTrump famously summed up his policy as\n\n\"bomb the shit out of\"\n\nthe Islamic State. He appeared to give a green light to the military to murder women and children, saying, \"When you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families.\" Iraqi troops described explicit orders to do exactly that in Mosul. Middle East Eye (MEE)\n\nreported\n\nthat Iraqi forces massacred all the survivors in Mosul's Old City.\n\n\"We killed them all,\" an Iraqi soldier said. \"Daesh (IS), men, women, children. We killed everyone.\" An Iraqi major told MEE,\n\n\"After liberation was announced, the order was given to kill anything or anyone that moved ... It was not the right thing to do ... They gave themselves up and we just killed them ... There is no law here now. Every day, I see that we are doing the same thing as Daesh. People went down to the river to get water because they were dying of thirst and we killed them.\"\n\nBy October 2017, Raqqa in Syria was even more\n\ntotally destroyed\n\nthan Mosul in Iraq. Under Obama and Trump, the United States and its allies have dropped more than\n\n118,000 bombs\n\nand missiles on Iraq and Syria in their campaign against the Islamic State, while US HIMARS rockets and US, French, and Iraqi heavy artillery killed\n\neven more\n\nindiscriminately.\n\nThe wholesale destruction of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, and other major cities in Iraq and Syria cannot be legally justified under the Hague and Geneva Conventions, any more than the destruction of entire cities in past wars, like Hiroshima or Dresden. Despite the total lack of accountability, it is clear that American bombs, rockets, and shells killed thousands of civilians in each city and town captured. Obama and Trump share responsibility for these\n\nterrible crimes\n\n, but they are an escalation of the systematic war crimes the United States has committed since 2001 under three presidents.\n\nIn Afghanistan, as the Taliban gradually takes control of more of the country, Trump has resisted the temptation to send in tens of thousands more US troops, as Obama did, but he instead approved a major escalation in US bombing that made 2018 and 2019 the\n\nheaviest\n\nand\n\ndeadliest\n\nyears of US bombing in Afghanistan since 2001.\n\nTrump has shrouded his war-making in even\n\ngreater secrecy\n\nthan Obama. The US military has not published a monthly Airpower Summary since February 2020, nor official troop deployment numbers for Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria for nearly three years. But the United States has dropped at least\n\ntwenty thousand bombs\n\non Afghanistan since Trump came to power, and there is no evidence of a reduction in bombing under the peace agreement the administration signed with the Taliban in February. Some US troops have been withdrawn under that agreement, but the remaining 8,600 are still\n\nbeing replaced\n\nas their tours end, keeping US troop strength at about the same level as when Obama left office.\n\nTrump made a great show of repositioning US troops in Syria in October 2019, leaving the United States' Kurdish allies in Rojava to confront the\n\nTurkish invasion\n\nalone. But there are still at least\n\n500 US troops\n\nin Syria, and Trump deployed\n\n14,000 more\n\nUS troops to the Middle East in 2019, including to a new base in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump has vetoed every bill passed by Congress to\n\ndisengage\n\nUS forces from the Saudi war in Yemen and to\n\nhalt the sales\n\nof US-made warplanes and bombs, which the Saudis use to systematically kill Yemeni civilians. He created a new conflict with Iran by pulling out of the nuclear deal, and in January 2020, he capriciously flirted with a full-scale\n\nwar on Iran\n\nby ordering the assassination of Iran's General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi military commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Iraq.\n\nTrump's bizarre decision to move the US Embassy in Israel to a\n\nplot of land\n\nthat is only partly within Israel's internationally recognized borders - and partly on Palestinian territory that Israel is illegally occupying - quite literally took US international relations into uncharted territory. Then Trump unveiled a so-called\n\npeace plan\n\nbased on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ambition to annex the rest of Palestine into a \"Greater Israel\" with vastly expanded - but still unrecognized and illegal - international borders.\n\nTrump has also backed a\n\ncoup in Bolivia\n\n, staged several\n\nfailed ones\n\nin Venezuela, and targeted even the United States'\n\nclosest allies\n\nwith\n\nsanctions\n\nto try to prevent them from trading with US enemies. Trump's brutal sanctions on Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Cuba are not a peaceful alternative to war, but a form of economic warfare just as deadly as bombs, especially during a pandemic and its accompanying economic meltdown.\n\nA Boon to the Merchants of Death\n\nOnce the large-scale US military occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan ended under Obama, the US\n\nmilitary budget\n\nfell to $621 billion by 2015. But since then, military spending for procurement, research and development (R&D), and base construction has risen by 39 percent. This has been a huge windfall for the Big Five US weapons makers - Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics - whose arms sales revenues\n\nrose 30 percent\n\nbetween 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe 49 percent increase to more than $100 billion for R&D on new weapons systems in 2020, part of the enormous $718 billion Pentagon budget, is a down payment on trillions of dollars in future revenue for the merchants of death unless these programs are stopped.\n\nThe pretext for Trump's huge investment in big-ticket, high-tech weapons, including a new Space Force with a $\n\n15 billion\n\nprice tag for 2021, is the New Cold War with Russia and China that he officially unveiled in the 2018\n\nNational Defense Strategy\n\n. Obama was already trying to shift away from the United States' lost counterinsurgency wars in the greater Middle East through his \"Pivot to Asia,\" the US-backed coup in Ukraine, and the expansion of US land and naval forces encircling Russia and China.\n\nBut Trump has the same problem as Obama as he tries to wriggle out of the \"forever wars\": how to bring US troops home without making it obvious to the whole world that this chronically weak imperial power and its extravagant multitrillion-dollar war machine has been\n\ndefeated everywhere\n\n. Even the most expensive weapons still only kill people and break things. Establishing peace and stability require other kinds of power and legitimacy, which the United States does not possess and which cannot be bought.\n\nBefore President Dwight D. Eisenhower left office in 1961,\n\nhe remarked\n\n, \"God help this country when someone sits in this chair who doesn't know the military as well as I do.\" Trump is obviously as dazzled by chests full of medals and whizz-bang technology as every other president since Eisenhower, so he will keep giving the Pentagon everything it wants to keep spreading violence and chaos around the world.\n\nJust as Obama co-opted and muted liberal opposition to Bush's wars and record arms spending, Trump has co-opted and muted conservative opposition to Obama's wars. Now, with the outpouring of protests against domestic police repression and calls for defunding the police, there is a growing chorus to also defund the military. That is certainly not a call Trump would listen to, but would Joe Biden be more receptive to public calls for peace and disarmament than Obama and Trump?\n\nProbably not, based on his long record in the Senate, his roles in authorizing war on\n\nYugoslavia\n\n, Afghanistan, and Iraq, his close ties to Israel, and his failure to rein in US war-making as vice president, despite personally\n\nopposing\n\nObama's escalation in Afghanistan. Biden is also trying to outdo Trump in his\n\nopposition to China\n\n. Like Obama and Trump, Biden would be mainly a new manager and salesman in chief to sell the military-industrial complex's latest strategy for war and global military occupation to the corporate media and the American public.\n\nWe will not rescue our country from the iron grip of the military-industrial complex by picking the lesser evil and hoping for the best. That has not worked for sixty years, since Eisenhower defined the problem so clearly in his\n\nfarewell address\n\n.\n\nOn the other hand, a civil society coalition, led by the Poor People's Campaign and including CODEPINK, is calling for a $350 billion cut in the military budget to fund human needs and public services, and representatives Barbara Lee, Pramila Jayapal, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have introduced a resolution\n\nin Congress\n\nto do just that.\n\nAt the margins, this campaign could have more impact on Biden than on Trump, but not if people sweep up the bunting on election night and think their job is done, as liberals did with Obama and anti-war conservatives did with Trump. Unless and until the American public applies overwhelming pressure to dismantle the US war machine and its futile bid for\n\n\"full spectrum\"\n\nglobal dominance, the US military will keep\n\nlosing wars\n\non its own terms, bleeding us dry (metaphorically), and bleeding our neighbors overseas dry (literally), until it loses a major war with\n\nmass US casualties\n\nor\n\ndestroys\n\nus all in a nuclear war.\n\nThe US peace movement has always had huge passive public support, but it will take mass collective action, not just passive support, to secure a peaceful future for our children and grandchildren. Public outrage and activism are starting to take away the license to kill black and brown people with impunity from the militarized RoboCops on our streets. The same kind of collective political action can defund and disarm the US military and take away its license to kill black and brown people everywhere.\n\nBuilding a new anti-war movement that is connected to the domestic anti-police struggle is the only thing that can rein in US militarism.
