02 2012 Who knows pornography better than a teenage boy In a bid to aid the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority PTA in its ongoing efforts to block online porn in Pakistan fifteenyearold Ghazi Muhammad Abdullah has compiled and sent forward a list of 780000 adult websites which he thinks should be blocked in Pakistan Speaking to ProPakistani Abdullah said that he sent this list to the PTA following a letter sent to him by Director General Law and Regulations which stated “If there is any specific website that you wish to bring into the knowledge of PTA it is requested that PTA may be informed of the same accordingly for further necessary action at our end” The teenager had previously written letters to the PTA Ministry of Information Technology and Chief Justice of Pakistan to get adult websites blocked in Pakistan Without revealing the specific selection process for the adult sites added to the list Abdullah told ProPakistani that he was aided by his friends whose names he wished not to share In an ongoing clampdown on the internet the judiciary and PTA have taken action against porn websites by blocking or banning access to over 13000 sites in the country Additionally a government department has recently called for proposals for the development deployment and operation of a national level URL Filtering and Blocking System The ad had been placed in local papers by National ICT RD Fund a division of the Ministry of Information Technology on February 22 2012 The proposal request states that each box of the system “should be able to handle a block list of up to 50 million URLs with a processing delay of not more than 1 millisecond” READ MORE ON PAKISTAN AND PORN Smutty DVD sales go up in Pakistan as porn sites go down Peshawar’s open secret Hardcore fun for a

we give the kid time off for coffee breaks eating sleeping and attending school it would have taken him about 21 man years to compile the list He must be a miracle worker He started many years before he was even born Jamset Ram C 8 years ago Reply Recommend Punnu Arent we all in shock I made a quick calculation of five minuted per porn site and it works out at more than seven man years to compile this list The kid must have been about eight year old when he started In my neck of the woods it would be illegal for somebody under eighteen of age to look at porn sights VIEW MORE COMMENTS Punnu 8

some help nd 15 year old searching for porn where are his parentss dey need to check his history more often p Adeel Ahmed 8 years ago Reply Recommend Friends What we need most is a shift in thoughts Banning porn site is not going to help Pakistan hist more porn sites than many other countries where nothing is banned PTA will continue to work like many other agencies of Pakistan Every damn bad thing is sold in Pakistan including porn and it will continue As far as the boy is concerned I am not sure about the facts reported so far My suggestion to the boy and his team is Good job done guys Pack your bags and relax HH 8 years ago Reply Recommend What an idiot kid HH 8 years ago Reply Recommend That 18 year old must have turned 35 after checking that much porn lolzzzz Salman 8 years ago Reply Recommend Now all the personnel at PTA Authorities will be checking every one of 780000 sites to see themselves that if these sites are really worth blocking FF 8 years ago Reply Recommend If he had spent the same amount of time working on the peace process Kashmir would have been solved by now I feel sorry for this kid once he realizes how much joy he took away from 180000000 people he will probably off himself Once hes done with the list of 750000 websites maybe he can move on to compiling a list of unregistered Madrassas to help the state regulate those too Actually if he did that Id

strange puberty must he be going through Foreigner 8 years ago Reply Recommend good step block these sites they have no beneficial purpose Shahid Saeed Khan 8 years ago Reply Recommend Excellent job done by the Pakistani boy If somebody is saying him Munafiq then he should look inside himself that who is actually a Munafiq and trying to pull the leg If you have some good idea then share it instead of unnecessay criticizing One another thing is that definitely any ISP is not serious and interested in blocking these porn sites because their businss runs due to them If some website is so called blocked then it is still accessible via its IP address Now who is Munafiq you can decide yourself Foreigner 8 years ago Reply Recommend wow u are a sorry bunch of boys arent you Is it really

need to get a life Do something productive get some confidence and make something of urself so ladies will actually talk to u Porn was made for the forever alone types in the West the geeks who couldnt get girls Anonymous 8 years ago Reply Recommend How did he do this There are 525600 minutes in a year If we assume that he slept at least 8 hours a day thats 175200 minutes he wasnt porn hunting Unless his friends took over while he slept That leaves 350400 minutes in a year Then there is also the issue of going to school doing homework eating etc For arguments sake well give these guys 5 hours or 300 minutes every day to hunt porn no days off That means they were getting 2600 porn sites a minute Or maybe it took him longer than a year to do this Something does not add up

Pakistan can well do with fewer species similar to this diligent student Hornet 8 years ago Reply Recommend I agree with you mr ethic Ahmed 8 years ago Reply Recommend Awais Khan It is illegal for a person of any age to enter such a site as far as Pakistan is concerned What other countries laws says does not matter as this ban would be enforceable in Pakistan only Truthbetold 8 years ago Reply Recommend Assuming the it took the boy two minutes to check out each site it took him 1560000 minutes That means he took 26000 hours to come up with all the site info Assuming he diligently worked 12 hours a day doing this great service it would have taken him 2167 days or six whole years to complete his thankless job So he must have started this job when he was nine Bilal 8 years ago Reply Recommend Chief Justice Who is watching porn SOU MOTO Moral In Pakistan we cant collect taxes might as well teach them a lesson Ban Porn zalim singh 8 years ago Reply Recommend this guy can be called Hafiz Tony C 8 years ago Reply Recommend I cannot understand why governments all over the world allow so many dreadful things to happen One can think of all manner of things that are going wrong in the area of morality and it doesnt matter if it is soft porn hard porn drugs and alcohol However given that we have to begin somewhere let us start with porn Unfortunately trying to stop access to porn on the web would be virtually impossible unless full censorship was imposed Starting on another tack this young man appears to be spending too much time in front of the computer and it cannot be healthy for him I wonder if he is available for spare time gardening I am not suggesting that he work in my garden because I already have someone to mow my grass and do the weeding but the exercise may be good for him Reeba 8 years ago Reply Recommend On first impression banning porn might seem like a good idea But perverts exist in all societies In an extremely conservative society the only way to release sexual frustration is probably watching porn If that is banned the number of rapes and sexual harassment will increase doublefold So sometimes things that appear as downright evil could be blessings in disguise SalSal 8 years ago Reply Recommend No one answers my question Oh well I knew it all along Liberals are just shallow and take their ideas from the West Janjua 8 years ago Reply Recommend He has ruined my life What am I do to now They have removed my only source of happiness My life is ruined loll drsami 8 years ago Reply Recommend great work kid WB 8 years ago Reply Recommend So a 15 year is gonna decide what is porn or not This can only happen in this land of the pure Muzammil 8 years ago Reply Recommend wlie8 8 years ago Reply Recommend People he is not even of the Legal age to do this I mean he surely had to visit these sites in order to check them that whether or not do they exist and every site says that you must not visit and leave immediately if you are below 18 Years of ageso technically the kiddo has already committed an illegal act Guilty as charged Antebellum 8 years ago Reply Recommend Ha ha Nothing pains these pseudoliberal wannabes as blocking porn vicky 8 years ago Reply Recommend he prepared this list of 780000 adult websites with help of friends having expertise in computers He wished not to disclose their names MarkH 8 years ago Reply Recommend Tony C They do bring in a lot of money In regard to how theyre treated taxwise it falls under the same rules as any other credit purchase MarkH 8 years ago Reply Recommend pervaiz memon You shouldnt be a parent Youre against it claiming its damaging but youd let your 12 year old do it Even countries that dont restrict it would tell you thats the quickest way to raise a sexual deviant It starts meshing with their perception of the outside world because theyre still developing that perception XXX 8 years ago Reply Recommend what does govt has to do if someone watches porn in his bedroom GR8 8 years ago Reply Recommend how he knowi think he has a passion for porn ZY 8 years ago Reply Recommend Another Maya Khan you got to be kidding me When would these people learn that they dont have the right to tell people what to do The democratic governments job is to follow what the people want not dictate us what to do The chain of command works the other way round and some body has to put some sense back into the retarded bureaucracy of Pakistan who are turning this country into a police state and than we all cry that our talent keep moving away from Pakistan to countries with more freedom John 8 years ago Reply Recommend Somebody should take a lesson from history and see how internet is designed Waste of time and resources as there are always ways to get around these barriers hina 8 years ago Reply Recommend Arent there more pressing and more important issues to solve like poverty and illiteracy Mr Honest 8 years ago Reply Recommend Very well done you man we need young people like you All the best Abba Jee 8 years ago Reply Recommend 780000 siteslet us do some time management 780000 seconds equal 13000 minutes 13000 minutes equal 21666 hours If he surfs 8 hours every day 216668 2708 days Which city in Pakistan has no load shedding less than 8 hours in 27 days Failing grade for this story quacker 8 years ago Reply Recommend Anybody who happens to have a a rudimentary knowledge of the internet can very easily circumvent all the stupid bans imposed by the PTA or by any other entity Just go to Google or other search engine put in a query on how to access restricted sites Additionally if there wasnt a massive demand for porn sites in our beloved LAND OF THE PURE why impose these brainless bans It is well to remember that despite our overt holiness flowing beards prayers fasting Pakistan along with Afghanistan are countries where women are in general treated horrendously Wouldnt this diligent student be better occupied in researching methods on achieving greater respect for women in our country rather than devoting efforts towards stupid bans which can be overridden very easily pervaiz memon 8 years ago Reply Recommend It is necessary that we must put your hand in garbage if we want to clean it as we daily did in toilet my son is 12 years if he was able to do this job I would be proud of him Great job son kept it up DevilHunterX 8 years ago Reply Recommend I bet those 780000 websites asked for credit card verification and to be over 18 No wonder he is angry Tony C 8 years ago Reply Recommend I have just realized that if the time taken for this student to compile his 780000 porn sites was seven years 780000 x 5 minutes 7 years he must have started at the time he was about eight years old Obviously a genius in the making I am quite elderly and do not know how to find one porn sight which I find somewhat embarrassing However I am only a little embarrassed and do not think I will waste my time looking Porn must be a very lucrative business If ten people access each site on a daily basis and pay US 500 for a visit it comes to US 39000000 per day That comes to over two billion US dollars annually I wonder if they have to pay income tax on it or do they have a dodgy US bank to launder it jaem 8 years ago Reply Recommend he had enough knowledge of Porn sites do your study instead Haider 8 years ago Reply Recommend Awais Khan Hes a youngster he needs time Akhtar 8 years ago Reply Recommend Had Osama bin laden been alive he would have punished this kid notfromaroundpakistan 8 years ago Reply Recommend one might consider that this boy is just giving face to something created by someone else to make headlines in news each and every damn government these days does follow dumb the chinese way when it comes to the internet censor it as hard as you can no matter the consequences i myself call it the chinesification of the net Humanity 8 years ago Reply Recommend Khadim Hussain wrote Very wise step

thing Inferiority complexed morally bankrupt indianized Pakistani Tony C 8 years ago Reply Recommend Ever since I read the above article about porn I have been trying to think of a similair analogy and Eureka I think I have it As any intelligent person knows watching porn is about as interesting as watching grass grow Well in my country they televise Government as they perform in Parliament and you cannot imagine a more boring inept bunch of weak minded extremely well paid scallywags and bullies with questionable morality whom they call politicians Although I do not intend to start watching porn or television for that matter there would be no contest if I had to choose between a bunch of ugly politicians of the ilk my country turns up and porn There would be absolutely no contest malik92

the fine for not wearing a mask has been increased to Rs 2000 in the wake of rising COVID19 cases in To build or not to build a temple – in Pakistan July 22 1809 2020 Print This Article Share it With Friends by India Post Newspaper Mahendra Ved Going by conflicting trends on social media one saying ‘Mandir Tau Banega’ Temple will be constructed and the other ‘Mandir Nahin Banega’ Temple will not be constructed the road to Pakistan’s first Hindu temple seems long controversial and full of uncertainties The temple is to come up as part of a community complex for the federal capital’s 3000plus Hindus on a four kanal plot in Sector H92 that the Hindus have been given possession However there are objections and some youths even vandalized the temporary fencing around the temple site Clips of the attack and a person offering ‘azan’ went viral on social media Mufti ZiaudDin of the Lahore chapter of Jamia Ashrafia a leading cleric in Pakistan has issued a fatwa against the construction of the temple by calling it “unIslamic” The fatwa issued initially when the federal grant was approved also states that according to Sharia laws it is not permitted for nonMuslims to build their new worship places or rebuild those which were in ruins as “this is a sin in an Islamic state” Minorities in Pakistan The issue reflects the inner contradictions in Pakistan an Islamic Republic Of the estimated 221 million Pakistani citizens over 96 percent are Muslim and around 185 percent are Hindus – although the Pakistan Hindu Council claims the latter number to be much higher Pakistan has only prepartition shrines for Hindu Christian and Sikhs some of these are historic and serve the country’s dwindling minorities According to the Evacuee Trust Property Board of the Government of Pakistan there are approximately 1300 temples in the country with only 30 considered currently functional According to a recent report in The Express Tribune “over the years temples have vanished from Pakistan’s largest city Karachi their remnants both a reminder of the past and a foretelling of a bleaker future for the port city’s Hindus” The federal cabinet under Prime Minister Imran Khan cleared Rs 100 million £500000 or 630685 worth of state funding on June 27 Following this the Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri told the National Assembly that there was “no question” about the temple but about the ability of the government funding The minister had himself sought the grant from the cabinet after meeting a delegation of Members of the National Assembly MNAs belonging to Hindu and Christian minorities including Lal Chand Malhi Dr Ramesh Vankwani Jai Prakash Ukrani Shunila Ruth and James Thomas The Islamabad High Court on July 8 rejected a bunch of petitions questioning the government’s move from political constitutional religious civic and administrative standpoints The Ulema Council of Pakistan a body of the Islamic clergy has approved of the government’s decision The government told the court that the issue had been referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology CII on whether Muslim taxpayer’s money can be used for construction of the temple CII Chairman Qibla Ayaz has acknowledged the receipt of the ministry’s letter and he forwarded it to the council’s research department to formulate an opinion CII is a statutory body and the construction of the temple can only begin if the CII gives a favorable decision Clearly the government’s decision has been praised by some while some radical religious groups spoke against it Some even threatened to kill the Hindus Those in support point out that the taxpayers’ money would be used and they include members of religious minorities as well Pakistan’s political right and the Islamists say a shrine for a religious minority in the Islamic Republic is against Islam The Holy Quran and the Hadith is being quoted in support Imran Khan – a liberal Prime Minister Khan is considered personally a liberal but his politics have been deeply conservative He had supported the Taliban while in the opposition However projecting Pakistan as “a symbol of hope and tolerance away from its violent sectarian past” has been part of the election promise that he made in the 2018 elections He had also promised to improve conditions for Pakistan’s religious minorities While conditions in the ground have remained largely unchanged Pakistan under Khan has played to the Western gallery by curbing militants like Hafiz Saeed who heads the proscribed LashkareTaiba LeT and ensured freedom for Asia Bibi a Christian woman convicted and jailed for long years on the charge of blasphemy The government’s move on the temple some media commentators suggest is to show Pakistan in a better light in comparison with India which is seen as being driven by Hindutva forces that are against India’s religious minorities In The Express Tribune July 13 2020 columnist Umair Zafar Malik states “The very foundations of Pakistan lay in the desire of a religious minority to escape persecution and create a homeland where they would not face social political or economic discrimination” Opposition Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz of the threetime premier Nawaz Sharif has supported the government’s temple move However the political right has echoed criticisms like that of the religious right The Speaker of the Punjab Assembly along with other political leaders has voiced strong contestations against the construction stating that it is against Islam and an insult to the Islamic kingdom In Dawn July 10 2020 political worker writer and teacher Aasim Sajjad Akhtar criticized those who are opposing the temple project “The temple may eventually be built but the hateful and threatening polemic which comes to the fore around such issues is endemic Hateful polemic is in fact just the tip of the iceberg in both the past and present churches have been burned down Hindu and Christian girls and women forcibly converted and married off unnamed and unseen thousands suffered lynching and targeted killings…” “…the temple episode is also instructive because it provides both insight into the deep penetration of state ideology into society segments of which now propagate religious supremacy as a matter of course as well as the distinct material interests associated with places of religious worship” The New Arab July 10 2020 quoted the Amnesty International “Halting the construction of a Hindu temple in Islamabad is an unconscionable act of bigotry that must be reversed immediately Everyone has a right to freedom of religion or belief a right that is guaranteed in Pakistan’s constitution and its international obligations” – South Asia Monitor Comments comments Related Articles Scroll Back To Top Caste a racial

its Implications The SinoIranian deal will help provide Iran with a bargaining chip with Europe and the US over easing sanction in the future as the West will divert its attention towards this holistic agreement Muhammad Irfan July 23 2020 Post US’s economic downturn and global isolation triggered by the Coronavirus Beijing sensed American vulnerability and initiated the SinoIranian deal Finding the perfect moment to forge a strategic agreement with Iran The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the People’s Republic of China consisting of 20 articles and Chinese investment in Iran of 400 billion over 25 years with 280 billion for the development of Iran’s petrochemical sectors and another 120 billion for the country’s transportation and manufacturing infrastructure covers banking commerce and services transportation and railway ports energy industry and dozens of other projects To benefit from Chinese investment and infrastructure projects and confront US domination in the world Iran has rightly capitalized on China’s growing influence across South East Asia Central Asia the Middle East and Gulf Cooperation Council countries A long term Chinese commitment ie the SinoIranian deal would help Tehran demand greater economic cooperation with Beijing Iran which has a vision of nonalignment with the slogan of neither East nor West since the 1979 revolution toppling its proAmerican monarch is steadily turning towards Asia as part of its LookEast strategy As in 2019 Iran China and Russia conducted a joint military exercise in the Gulf of Oman Moreover Iran requires both China and Russia with veto power in UN Security Council to neutralize US hegemony and to prevent any kind of sanctions by the United Nationsbacked by the USFurthermore insatiable oil demand and military and civilian technology pushes Iran toward an alliance with the rising superpower An end to Iran’s nonalignment strategy The SinoIranian deal if enforced as planned would more effectively end Iran’s nonalignment and incorporate Iran into the framework of Eurasia This strategic shift and incorporation into the area of Eurasia region indicate Iran has the capacity to find economic partners and energy consumers among major economies of the continent to quench its economic progress thirst The failure of Iran’s repeated attempts to improve economic links with the West as a prelude to improved political ties has been a major reason for Iran’s move towards China and other Asian countries regarded locally as the “pivot to the east” Iran welcomed American and European companies into the country including many energy companies after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015 and offered to buy oil and gas However the response to Iranian offers by Western states under pressure from the US was inhospitable Washington was not interested in improving relations but instead wanted regime change in Tehran and Iranian leadership soon smelled a rat Read More The ChinaIran deal Not about business but strategic communication Recipe for ailing Iran economic burden The infusion of a significant amount of cash into its economy especially its energy sector 280bn and manufacturing and transport infrastructure 120bn would be a recipe for Iran’s ailing economy and ease its economic burden No doubt it will create more jobs in the Islamic Republic of Iran and more industrial growth Iran’s deal with China is expected to relieve domestic opposition too Economic and political progress would boost the regional status of Iran and perhaps allow opponents to reduce tensions with Tehran Arab states might rush to make their own special deal with China Iran which has much of the world’s oil reserves and is one of the top five producers of natural gas had to face an economic shrinkage of around 10 percent largely due to the reintroduction of US sanctions Because of the COVID19 outbreak Iran’s economy was hit hard with the lowest oil and gas output Oil output and revenues have plummeted — falling from nearly 4 million bpd in 2018 to just 2 million bpd nowadays as per New York Times The supreme leader a staunch advocate of making alliance with nonWestern powers sees this deal more reliable than Western power ie the US or Europe President Trump’s decision to scrap the Iran nuclear deal 2015 further intensified public emotions President Hassan Rouhani who once wanted to open avenues with the West also advocated greater cooperation with Asian economies like China Japan and South Korea Following the futile effort to reopen Iran’s economy to the West after the nuclear agreement he now tries to negotiate a fair agreement with the only major world power whose economic weight can match that of the US or Europe Read More Iran shuns Indian investment turns to China Strategic alignment with an Asian superpower Iran is in dire need of civil and military cooperation and voice on a global scale which can only be achieved by aligning itself with a superpower with enormous investment potential in multidimensional sectors in the form of this SinoIranian deal In addition Iran wishes to expand its sphere of influence in the Eurasian region by acquiring full membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization To this end China the founding member of the organization is required to support it Similarly the SinoIranian deal will help provide Iran with a bargaining chip with Europe and the US over easing sanction in the future as the West will divert its attention towards this holistic agreement China’s more pronounced interest in Iran should alert the US to review its past approach towards Tehran It would also serve as a balancing factor in the normalization of relations between the West and Beijing which due to Corona and trade war between them is at the lowest stage Benefits for China from the SinoIranian deal Beijing on the other hand is a big winner and plays a longer game At Iranian ports it could enjoy preferential treatment and develop free trade zones around the country It will also include discounts for Iranian oil Iran is to provide regular and discounted supply of oil to China for 25 years ”China would also develop freetrade zones in Maku in Northwestern Iran in Abadan where the Shatt alArab river flows into the Persian Gulf and on the gulf island Qeshm” according to a NYT report This agreement promises to greatly enhance China’s position not only in the Middle East but also in Central Asia the Black Sea the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean sea Through this route Beijing would have a land route to Europe Probably China will have a large security footprint at two new ports expected to be established adjacent to the Strait of Hormuz through which oil trade passes by 30 to 40 per cent Oil supply to its market would be assured In addition China’s regional position would be strengthened by having a presence on Iranian land ultimately undermining US strategic supremacy in the Gulf This could also strengthen China’s international position Deepening ties with Iran is an outcome to safeguard its interests The very reason why the US geopolitical supremacy over the world is preserved is the control of world’s maritime routes in the world Among nine key maritime channels the Gulf of Hormuz significantly controls the major global outflow of fossil fuels The Chinese presence would give stronghold on these waters through which much of the world’s oil transits The US assistance to ASEAN countries to limit Beijing’s scope and legitimacy on the South China Sea would be of no benefit but to give China more options to use Similarly it would be no use for the US to condemn the Hong Kong issue Providing military and economic assistance to the SouthEastern partners to contain China and labeling violation of the navigation freedom provided under UNCLOS Convention on the Law of Sea would not weaken China’s efforts for its territorial claims China will certainly consider alternatives Read More Iran says no reason to hide deal with China More provisions of the SinoIranian Deal The deal has a provision of China building infrastructure for 5G telecommunications network in Iran It would provide an opportunity to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei a company that is facing US sanctions to enter the Iranian market It would also bolster China’s new digital currency eRMB as a way to bypass American financial systems and reduce the power of the dollar It would benefit China the world’s most energy consumer Furthermore Iran could find a mechanism to sell its oil while evading US sanctions Iran having million barrels of oil and gas now a burden on Iran’s economy to finance oil storage would ultimately benefit from this deal If the SinoIranian deal was implemented it would revive Iran’s economy and consequently stabilise its politics On the other hand over the decades China would have continual energy supply to materialize its vision of connecting the Eurasian region and challenge the world’s US Unipolarity Yet in global affairs nothing is everlasting The US returning to the Iran’s nuclear deal and lifting sanctions against Iran and allowing European and American companies to deal with Tehran may avert Iran’s strategic partnership with China Muhammad Irfan is a civil servant in Pakistan
