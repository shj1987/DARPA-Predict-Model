to build or not to build a temple to build or not to build a temple   in pakistan   going by conflicting trends on social_media , one saying ' mandir tau banega ' ( temple will_be_constructed ) and the other , ' mandir nahin banega ' , ( temple will not be constructed ) , the road to pakistan 's first_hindu_temple seems long , controversial and full of uncertainties .   the temple is to come up as part of a community complex for the federal_capital 's 3,000 - plus hindus on a four_kanal plot in sector h-9/2 that the hindus have been given possession . however , there are objections and some youths even vandalized the temporary fencing around the temple_site . clips of the attack and a person offering ' azan ' went_viral_on_social_media .   mufti zia - ud - din of the lahore chapter of   jamia ashrafia , a leading cleric in pakistan , has issued_a_fatwa_against the construction_of_the_temple   by calling it " un - islamic . " the fatwa , issued initially when the federal grant was approved , also states that according to sharia laws , it is not permitted for non - muslims to build their new worship_places or rebuild those , which were in ruins as " this is a sin in an islamic_state . "   the issue reflects the inner contradictions in pakistan , an islamic_republic . of the estimated 221 million pakistani citizens , over 96_percent are muslim and around 1.85 percent are hindus   although the pakistan_hindu_council claims the latter number to be much_higher .   pakistan has only pre - partition shrines for hindu , christian and sikhs ; some of these are historic and serve the country 's dwindling minorities . according to the evacuee_trust_property_board of the government of pakistan , there are approximately 1,300 temples in the country with only 30 considered currently functional .   according_to_a_recent_report in the express_tribune , " over the years , temples have vanished from pakistan 's largest_city ( karachi ) , their remnants both a reminder of the past and a foretelling of a bleaker future for the port_city 's hindus " .   the federal_cabinet under prime_minister_imran_khan cleared rs . 100_million ( 500,000 or $_630,685 ) worth of state funding on june_27 . following this , the minister_for_religious_affairs , noorul_haq_qadri , told the   national_assembly that there was " no question " about the temple , but about the ability of the government funding   . the minister had himself sought the grant from the cabinet after meeting a delegation of members of the national_assembly ( mnas ) belonging to hindu_and_christian minorities , including lal_chand_malhi , dr. ramesh vankwani , jai_prakash Ukrani , Shunila ruth , and james thomas .   the islamabad_high_court
new axis of power : sino - iranian deal and its implications " the sino - iranian deal will help provide iran with a bargaining_chip with europe and the us over easing sanction in the future as the west will divert its attention_towards this holistic agreement . "   post us 's economic_downturn and global isolation triggered by the coronavirus , beijing sensed american vulnerability and initiated the sino - iranian deal .   finding the perfect moment to forge a strategic agreement with iran   the comprehensive_strategic_partnership between the islamic_republic_of_iran and the people 's_republic_of_china , consisting of 20 articles and chinese investment in iran of $_400_billion over 25 years , with $_280 billion for the development of iran 's petrochemical sectors and another $_120_billion for the country 's transportation and manufacturing infrastructure , covers banking , commerce and services , transportation and railway , ports , energy , industry , and dozens of other projects .   to benefit from chinese investment and infrastructure_projects and confront u.s. domination in the world , iran has rightly capitalized on china 's growing_influence across south_east_asia , central_asia , the middle_east and gulf_cooperation_council countries . a long_term chinese commitment i.e. , the sino - iranian deal , would help tehran demand greater economic_cooperation with beijing .   iran , which has a vision of non - alignment with the slogan of neither east nor west since the 1979 revolution toppling its pro - american monarch , is steadily turning towards asia as part of its look - east strategy . as in 2019 , iran , china , and russia conducted a joint_military_exercise in the gulf_of_oman . moreover , iran requires both china and russia , with veto_power in un_security_council , to neutralize u.s. hegemony , and to prevent any_kind of sanctions by the united_nations - backed by the u.s.furthermore , insatiable oil_demand and military_and_civilian technology pushes iran toward an alliance with the rising superpower .   an end to iran 's non - alignment strategy   the sino - iranian deal , if enforced as planned , would more effectively end iran 's non - alignment and incorporate iran into the framework of eurasia . this strategic_shift and incorporation into the area of eurasia region indicate iran has the capacity to find economic partners and energy consumers among major_economies of the continent to quench its economic progress thirst .   the failure of iran 's repeated_attempts to improve economic links with the west as a prelude to improved political ties has been a major_reason for iran 's move towards china and other asian_countries , regarded locally as the " pivot to the east " .   iran welcomed american and european companies into the country including many energy companies after the nuclear_deal was signed in 2015 and offered to buy oil_and_gas . however
uk universities must cut reliance on chinese money : think_tank british universities must cut reliance on chinese money to maintain independence : think_tank   a think_tank has warned that british universities have become " worryingly dependent " on foreign income , especially from china , with two - thirds of revenue raised from charging chinese students going to some of the uk 's top research_institutes .   by the centre - right think_tank onward found that of the 5.8_billion income universities derive from overseas , non - eu students , more_than a third   2.1_billion   comes from china . around 1.4_billion of that went into the elite russell group of universities alone .   the report , published on wednesday , also argues that an increase in overseas students has crowded out british students from some of the top universities in the past_four_years , including at oxford , cambridge , manchester , imperial_college_london , university_college_london , and the london_school_of_economics .   " as previous onward research_shows , the growth of international students at oxford_and_cambridge has been matched with a decline in the number of state school_pupils winning places at these institutions , " the report said .   further , in last_year 's intake , more chinese students were accepted into uk universities than " the number from the south_west , or yorkshire and the Humber , or the east midlands , or wales , the north_east or northern_ireland " . the higher_education statistics agency   in january that 35_per_cent of all non - eu overseas students are from china .   ten british universities are dependent on chinese students for more_than a quarter of their income including glasgow , liverpool , and sheffield universities ( 28 per_cent ) ; imperial_college_london ( 26 per_cent ) ; and university_college_london and the university of manchester ( 26 per_cent ) .   significantly , this dependence also creates fragility in terms of academic independence , with the report warning that " there are well - founded concerns that the chinese_communist_party ( ccp ) or organisations that it controls have sought   in some cases successfully   to undermine academic_freedom and the integrity of scientific_research on uk campuses " .   red guards in britain : china ambassador calls on chinese students in uk to ' serve the motherland '   onward 's director and author of the report   : " while overseas students generate valuable income and international focus on uk campuses , universities have become worryingly dependent on them for their finances , undermining their independence , credibility and long - term sustainability .   " britain has never had a serious debate about the growth of overseas students . yet the viability of the uk 's most_prestigious universities   to say nothing

why pakistan 's shan masalas have a cult following in india > why pakistan 's shan masalas have a cult following in india   the pakistani packaged masala brand has many fans in india , despite a somewhat erratic supply_chain . what makes it so popular ?   each time the supply of this particular masala blend becomes erratic in bengaluru , foodie groups on facebook_and_whatsapp start buzzing . " i found two packets of sindhi biryani masala at aishwarya supermarket in Koramangala . " " mega more on Sarjapur road has haleem and bombay biryani . " " amazon has some varieties but they are only selling packs of 8 , anyone want to split up the order ? "   over the past_decade , shan , a packaged masala brand from pakistan , has slowly invaded indian kitchens . fans of shan follow developments in india - pakistan relations with a hawk eye , because often , escalating_tensions at the border seem to result in the supply of pakistani products in india becoming sparse and unpredictable . last_year , a few_days after the attack on indian forces in pulwama , my_husband turned to me and said , " how are we doing on shan ? " , a quiver of anxiety in his voice . i had stocked up on the biryani and korma masalas , i assured him , but we were running_low on the haleem .   more_than a year later , the shan haleem masala remains elusive ( maybe it 's the covid-19 effect this time ) and my annual haleem - making adventure during ramzan had to be put_on_hold . friends in mumbai and delhi , however , say shan is " more_or_less available " in their cities . this felt patently unfair and i recently_discovered why bengaluru had these periodic shortages . according to an_interview_with shan foods ' founder sikander sultan by the   in 2014 , while the company has made_inroads_into the north - indian market and was even leading in certain sub - categories within the packaged masala blend segment , they had n't expanded to " some geographies like the south . "   the company , it seems , is not actively distributing the product in southern indian cities , and it 's only thanks to some enterprising retailers that a few of the masala varieties are available at all in bengaluru , and this naturally suffers when the overall supply falls because of border_tensions .   if mr sultan ever reads this , he should know that he is losing out on a lucrative and highly_motivated market . " i have asked my sister to courier them to me from delhi , " says bengaluru - based food consultant and writer monika Manchanda . " i 've been looking for them

" these tricks can not fool the americans and international_community . it must be emphasized that china has no intentions to change the us in terms of its social system , and the us can not change china either , " wang said .   wang 's remarks_were_made after pompeo made a speech at the richard_nixon presidential library on thursday , in which he said his country 's engagement with china was a failure and called for chinese people and countries in the " free world " to " change " the cpc . his speech was denounced by chinese analysts as " clich " and " crazy . "   wang pointed_out_that pompeo 's speech was in the richard_nixon presidential library . nixon himself was the " icebreaker " of china - us relations . the two countries ' history is just and any attempt to reverse the course of history will_not_succeed , wang said .   we urge the us government to abandon its cold_war_mentality and ideological_bias , stop its negative words_and_deeds , and create_conditions that normalize bilateral_relations , wang said .

india - china : time for a reset click_here to get the latest issue for free   things have n't been this adversarial since the 1960s , but india and china also have a chance to reassess and rebuild their fraught_relationship   issue date : july_27 , 2020   the death_of_20_indian_soldiers and an_unknown_number of pla ( people 's_liberation_army ) soldiers in a clash in ladakh on june_15 marks an_inflection_point in india - china relations . the clash was a result of changes in chinese behaviour on the border since april this year . the pla has attempted to establish a permanent presence across the line_of_actual_control ( lac ) , concentrated force along the line and prevented indian_soldiers from following their normal_patrolling_patterns in several places in ladakh . in effect , china 's actions have changed_the_status_quo that both_sides are legally_bound to respect under a series of bilateral_agreements since_1993 . a reset of india - china relations is now inevitable and necessary .   the june_15_clashes come as the culmination of a series of incidents of ever growing scale , duration and severity along the india - china border since_2012 . in 2013 , the pla intruded across the line and pitched_tents in depsang , withdrawing after negotiations over two_and_a_half_weeks . in september_2014 , on the day that president_xi_jinping arrived in india for a state visit , over a thousand pla_troops entered chumar and only vacated the area three weeks after his visit . in 2017 , the pla entered and stayed on the doklam_plateau , disputed between bhutan and china , an area they had only patrolled sporadically before . a 72 - day stand - off between_indian_and_chinese_troops ended with the face - off spot being vacated by both_sides . since then , the chinese have left the face - off spot vacant but have built permanent_structures and stayed through the year on the rest of the doklam_plateau . however , the intrusions_in_ladakh this year are a significant escalation , for they occurred at_multiple_points_along the LACat depsang , galwan , hot_springs , pangong_tso and , according to local ladakhis , elsewhere as well . chinese forces have been strengthened in the eastern and middle sectors as well .   it could well be that china drew the wrong lessons from the doklam experience . the government of india claimed a victory in having faced down the chinese and got them to move_away_from the face - off spot . the chinese may have concluded that a two - steps - forward - one - step - back approach , like the one they have followed in the south_china_sea , would work on the india border as well and that they could change outcomes on the ground without risk of major conflict or military pushback .   the narendra_modi government 's reaction to chinese actions since april
the pandemic shows the urgency of reforming care for the elderly the pandemic shows the urgency of reforming care for the elderly   most people should be helped at home as they age   editor 's note : some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of   . for more stories and our pandemic tracker , see our   death , " says stephanie ( not her_real_name ) of her first day at camilla care community , a nursing_home in mississauga , a city in canada . she and other care_workers were sent to help out at the 236 - bed_facility in april as covid-19 ripped_through its narrow corridors and crowded wards . dozens of staff fell_ill or refused to work . by mid - july nearly one - third of the residents had died . outside , on a patch of grass , 69 small white crosses commemorate them .   across the rich world nearly_half of all deaths from covid-19 have happened in care and nursing_homes , even_though less_than_1 % of people live in them . in canada 80 % of all the deaths from covid-19 have happened in places such as camilla ( see_chart 1 ) . in britain the pathogen has killed an estimated 5 % of all people living in such institutions . the problem is not only that the residents ' age makes them particularly_vulnerable , but also that their living arrangements created opportunities for the virus to spread . countries with fewer care_homes have had fewer covid-19 deaths , all else being equal . the number of care - home beds explains 28 % of the variation in death_rates among european_countries and 16 % among american states , according to a study by neil Gandal and colleagues at tel_aviv_university .   politicians are under pressure to put more cash into care - home safety , inspections and quality_standards . in the short_term care_homes will need more personal_protective_equipment (   ) and better access to testing . but the disaster also offers a chance to reimagine care . in the future , many experts_argue , the vast_majority of old people should be looked after at home for as long as possible . in all but the most severe cases this is cheaper . it is also what most old people want . putting them in big institutions is the opposite of what they say they value most : autonomy and independence . and for those who still need it , residential care should be transformed .   most people will need care as they age . in some countries that will bankrupt them . some 70 % of americans who reach the age_of_65 will eventually need help doing at_least two basic daily activities , such as washing or dressing ; 48 % will receive

pla conducts maritime attack drills , deploys warplanes in south_china_sea amid us aggression the chinese people 's_liberation_army ( pla ) recently conducted maritime target attack drills in the south_china_sea and deployed warplanes in an island in the region at_a_time_when the us aggressively sent warplanes for close - up reconnaissance and warships including aircraft_carriers for exercises and operations in the name of " freedom_of_navigation . "   facing continuous military_provocations by the us , which is the real pusher of militarization in the south_china_sea , the pla could be forced to increase its presence with routine deployments and exercises to safeguard_national_sovereignty and territorial_integrity , analysts said on monday .   a brigade under the pla_southern_theater_command navy aviation forces based in south china 's hainan_province held live - fire maritime target attack drills with jh-7 fighter_bombers from wednesday to thursday , china national radio ( CNR ) reported on sunday .   citing a commercial_satellite image , forbes reported on friday that the pla had deployed at_least four j-11B fighter_jets to Yongxing island of the xisha_islands in the south_china_sea by wednesday .   since july , the us military has been making frequent provocations in the south_china_sea . on two occasions in two_weeks , it sent two aircraft_carriers to the region for drills . a us warship trespassed_into waters off the nansha islands on july 14 , and multiple us reconnaissance_aircraft also conducted frequent close - up reconnaissance operations on china 's southern_coast , according to reports .   these incidents , taking_place thousands_of_miles_away from the us and on china 's doorstep , have again proven that the us is the real pusher of militarization in the south_china_sea , and china is forced to take_countermeasures to safeguard its national_sovereignty_and_territorial integrity , a chinese_military_expert who_asked_not_to_be_identified told_the_global_times_on_monday .   pla drills in the south_china_sea take_place frequently , and it is also not the first time the pla has deployed warplanes in south_china_sea islands , observers_noted .   according to foreign satellite_images cited by media , the pla deployed   kj-500 airborne_early_warning and control system and y-8 anti - submarine aircraft on the Yongshu reef   in may. in june 2019 ,   j-10 fighter_jets were also deployed to Yongxing island   confirming the j-10 deployment in june 2019 , defense_ministry spokesperson ren Guoqiang said at a routine_press_conference that month that it is a legitimate right of sovereign countries to deploy facilities and conduct training on their_own territories . the chinese_side 's actions are lawful , reasonable and fair .   if us military_provocations in the south_china_sea persist , china could be left_with_no_choice_but to conduct more drills and deploy more warships and warplanes in the south_china_sea , to the extent of setting_up a possible air_defense identification_zone ( adiz ) , the anonymous military expert said , noting that the j-11 has superior operational
houston consulate closure a desperate , boneheaded move houston consulate closure a desperate , boneheaded move   yet again , my_hometown finds_itself at the center of controversy . houston just ca_n't catch a break .   in a shocking , perplexing move , the chinese_consulate - general there has been informed by the us_state_department it must close in a matter of days , with no warning and no reason given aside from a specious list of evidence - free accusations .   this bizarre attack hits close to home , and i mean that quite_literally . houston is only an hour 's drive from the texas county where i was raised , and having a consulate a stone 's throw_away was especially useful for my move to beijing .   without the houston facility i would have had to either travel across the country to get visa approval or pay for a proxy service , both of which were well outside my price_range . an error on my part necessitated repeat trips   do_n't remove staples on certified documents , folks ! and it was the convenience of the houston location that made it feasible for me to get my paperwork done while between jobs , living at home and collecting unemployment .   so when i heard the news i thought of the many people who counted on that consulate , particularly houston 's sizable chinese population . where will they go ? what financial and logistical hurdles will they have to leap to access basic consular_services ?   it 's clear the state_department and the trump_administration do_n't_care . in fact , i 'd wager they consider it a bonus . it 's not as though his government has done anything for the poor and working - class people of the united_states , least of all immigrants ; they 've been hit_hardest_by the covid-19 pandemic , and the jaw - droppingly bad job the us has done in fighting the virus has only made_things_worse .   with millions of cases , over a hundred_thousand dead , tens_of_millions out of work and countless evictions looming , trump 's approval_ratings are at a near - historic_low . an election in only four_months demands a new plan to prop_up those plummeting poll_numbers , and it appears trump and his team are relying on an old favorite : " blame china . "   it 's the spaghetti strategy , so named for the technique chefs use to check if pasta is ready : " throw it at the wall and see what sticks . " first , they tried to claim covid-19 was cooked up in a chinese lab . then , they pushed a theory of an accidental leak .   neither instance of finger - pointing caught on , as

chinese authorities destroy minor dam to release three_gorges flood floods force china to blow up dam to protect world 's largest hydroelectric plant   chinese_state_media announced on sunday that it blasted holes in the Chuhe river dam in order to " alleviate the pressure of flood_control " at the massive three_gorges_dam , which is straining under the pressure from flooding of the mighty yangtze_river .   while chinese media strove to portray the controlled demolition of the lesser dam as routine and the situation at three_gorges as completely under control , outside observers are worried the gigantic three_gorges_dam   the largest hydroelectric_power plant in the world   will be unable to contain the pressure from floods that have killed hundreds of people . if the three_gorges_dam fails , an unprecedented humanitarian and economic_catastrophe could result .   that three_gorges is " buckling_under the strain of massive flows of water " from a number of other dams on tributary rivers at higher elevations as higher - than - normal rainfall produces what some in china describe as the worst flooding in a century . over 400 of the yangtze_river 's many tributaries are overflowing , the floods have killed almost 200 people , and projected economic_damage stands at over $_12_billion dollars .   the chinese regime reported another 14   in flooding upstream of the three_gorges_dam over the weekend , while rising floodwaters and landslides forced the evacuation of over 20,000 more people and destruction of over a thousand homes . the total_number of people the floods displaced during this monsoon_season is approaching 2 million .   all of those problems will grow_exponentially worse if the three_gorges_dam cracks . chinese_troops and disaster_relief personnel have been racing to contain the smaller floods leading into the yangtze , with fingers_crossed that rainfall will begin abating this week . at_least one more major surge of river_water is expected to hit the dam in the next_few_days .   chinese media strove to portray the demolition of the lesser dam on the Chuhe river in anhui_province as a routine procedure , but   cited some reports that the dam was " blown to bits with explosives " rather_than being poked with a few holes to relieve some water pressure .   that widespread demolition of dams and embankments is a flood_control tactic the chinese have not resorted to since 1998 . judging by chinese   , the tactic appears to have worked , because the level of flood_water hitting the three_gorges_dam dropped by about 25_percent on sunday , allowing the water to pass through the dam 's discharge system " smoothly . "   the three_gorges_dam " has largely eased flood prevention pressure in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze_river , " providing vital relief to areas that would otherwise experience

the deadly secret of china 's illegal fishing armada : it 's killing impoverished north_korean squid fishermen the deadly secret of china 's invisible armada   desperate north_korean fishermen are washing ashore as skeletons because of the world 's largest illegal fleet .   off the coast of south_korea   the battered wooden " ghost boats " drift through the sea of japan for months , their only cargo the corpses of starved north_korean fishermen whose bodies have been reduced to skeletons . last_year more_than_150 of these macabre vessels washed ashore in japan , and there have been more_than_500 in the past_five_years .   for years the grisly phenomenon mystified japanese police , whose best guess was that climate_change pushed the squid population farther from north_korea , driving the country 's desperate fishermen dangerous distances from shore , where they become stranded and die from exposure .   but an nbc_news investigation , based on new satellite_data , has revealed what marine researchers now say is a more likely explanation : china is sending a previously invisible armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in north_korean waters , violently displacing smaller north_korean boats and spearheading a decline in once - abundant squid stocks of more_than_70 percent .   the chinese vessels   nearly_800 in 2019   appear to be in violation of u.n. sanctions that forbid foreign fishing in north_korean waters . the sanctions , imposed in 2017 in response to the country 's nuclear_tests , were intended to punish north_korea by not allowing it to sell fishing rights in its waters in exchange for valuable foreign_currency .   " this is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated_by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation 's waters , " said Jaeyoon park , a data scientist from   , a global ocean conservation nonprofit_group co - founded by google , based in washington . the group specializes in artificial_intelligence and satellites that , along with an international team of academic researchers , discovered the chinese fleet .   presence of satellite - detected vessels fishing in north_korean waters in 2018   china is a member of the u.n. security_council , which unanimously signed the recent north_korean sanctions . but the flotilla violating this ban makes up nearly a third of the entire chinese distant - water fishing fleet , according to global fishing watch .   when_asked_to_comment_on the investigation , the chinese ministry_of_foreign_affairs said that " china has consistently and conscientiously enforced the resolutions_of_the_security_council relating to north_korea .

cpec & security implications for india by Bhavdeep modi the china_pakistan_economic_corridor or simply cpec , is the flagship_initiative of chinese_investments in pakistan under the belt_&_road_initiative ( bri ) . announced in 2014 by xi_jinping , it is a 15 - year package investment in pakistan by china till the year 2030 . the project is valued_at_$ 62_billion , as of 2017 . this amount is much_higher_than the total investment injected in pakistan by the united_states in total , till_date . under this initiative , various projects on energy development , infrastructural_development , port development and railway_lines development have been signed by both the countries . it has been estimated by pakistani experts that the development of cpec would lead to creation of at_least 2.3_million jobs by_2030 . it will serve as the bedrock of growing strategic relations_between islamabad and beijing , while posing_serious threats to various state - actors in the region .   there have been growing_concerns among indian strategic experts & analysts regarding the security implications that are going to emanate_from the development of the china_pakistan_economic_corridor . these concerns led to india rejecting chinese requests to join the belt_&_road_initiative on various occasions , citing the violation of its national_security_and_sovereignty . a separate faction of experts and analysts were of the view that joining bri would give india a much - needed economic boost , especially in the north - eastern states of india , which still remain relatively isolated from developmental_projects . however , the security_concerns far outweighed the economic advantages that the cpec posed to india , and india eventually decided to stay out of the belt_&_road_initiative .   to begin with , it would be pertinent to borrow from what james Schwemlein mentioned in a special report for united_states institute for peace in 2019 . he explained china 's investment in cpec in three ways :   1 . 	 the development of cpec would point to china 's attractiveness as a partner .   2 . 	 that china 's economic model can be exported .   3 . 	 to use pakistan as an element of its strategic connection with the united_states and india .   china has often managed to win influence over countries by pumping large_amounts of money into them , eventually making them dependent on chinese money . this tactic has been termed as ' debt_trap_diplomacy ' in international_relations , a tactic china is adept_at playing . the china_pakistan_economic_corridor is a classic_example of the same . post the stoppage of aid from washington , pakistan turned to china . many analysts_believe that china timed the offer of cpec to pakistan extremely well . the offer came_at_a_time_when pakistan was in a deep economic_crisis as_a_result of being overburdened with debts taken by it through the international_monetary_fund ( imf ) . moreover , cpec serves china 's strategic_interests

haq 's musings : covid19 in pakistan : test_positivity_rate and deaths declining icra ltd. has sharply cut its forecast for the indian economy in fy21 , citing localised lockdowns and rising covid-19 cases . its forecast is now the most pessimistic among major institutional forecasters .   the rating_agency now expects fy21 real_gdp to contract by 9.5 % , a sharp_downward revision of its earlier forecast of a 5 % contraction . the climbing covid-19 infections have resulted in a spate of localised lockdowns in some states and cities , arresting the nascent recovery that had set in during may - june 2020 , it said in a statement on thursday .   " the indian economy had started to recover from the troughs experienced in april 2020 , when the lockdown was at its severest , and many sectors seemed to be adjusting to a new normal . however , the unabated rise in covid-19 infections in the unlock phase and re - imposition of localised lockdowns in several states , appear to have interrupted this recovery , " said aditi nayar , principal economist at icra .   given the severity of the pandemic and the duration of the safety_measures that need to be employed , we now expect a deeper pace of gdp contraction in q2 fy21 relative to our earlier forecast , icra said . the agency said the economic_impact would also be more uneven , as different regions move in and out of lockdowns and persisting labour supply mismatches affect supply_chains and consumption patterns .   india recorded nearly 32,000 new covid-19 cases on thursday with the total_number_of_cases rising to 9.6 lakh .   as_a_result of the spreading infections , economists , who were earlier anticipating the economic_recovery to begin in the second_quarter and strengthen in the third_quarter , are now revisiting that assumption .   the timeline for a firmer recovery out of the contractionary phase is now being pushed ahead to at_least q4 fy21 from q3 fy21 . this presumes that a vaccine will be widely_available by then , which now appears necessary for discretionary consumption to recover in certain sectors such as travel , hospitality and recreation .   aditi nayar , principal economist , icra   also read : covid-19 : shape of india 's economic_recovery goes from v to w - ish
imran_khan govt under fire for providing jadhav legal_option against conviction islamabad : the imran_khan government in pakistan is facing an uproar for facilitating legal_remedies for alleged_indian_spy kulbushan_jadhav , with the opposition_parties slamming it for bringing in a " national_reconciliation_ordinance " .   the session of the national_assembly saw a heated_debate on the matter after pakistan people party ( ppp ) chief bilawal_bhutto_zardari cited out_quorum to prevent the government from laying_down an ordinance pertaining to granting foreign citizens an opportunity to file_a_review_appeal . the opposition blamed the government for trying to get a rubber_stamp from the parliament on what it called " facilitating a terrorist , who had confessed to his role_in_promoting unrest and terrorism in pakistan " . " a terrorist who has confessed to bring involved in terrorism in our country , against whom we have completed legal_proceedings - what_has_happened now that we are formally legislating to facilitate him ? " asked pakistan muslim_league- nawaz ( pml - n ) leader_khawaja_asif .   lashing_out_at the imran_khan government , asif sought to remind them of the " taunts " the pml - n government faced from the then opposition party of imran_khan . " we were taunted , now this government and this prime_minister must tell us why he is stooping so low in front of india ? " he said . in its response , the government contended that the pml - n government should never have gone to the international_court_of_justice in the first place . " from the first day , we had said that it was wrong of the then government to go to the icj and it was not just our party 's stance , it was the ppp 's as well , " said human_rights_minister_shireen_mazari .   " if one country does_not accept the icj 's jurisdiction , the case is not heard , " she added . while the cross - accusations over jadhav 's verdict review kept the parliament_session heated , the foreign_office defended the move of the government , asserting that the decision was pertinent to implement the verdict of the icj .   pakistan maintains that it has been asked by the icj to review_and_reconsider the conviction_and_sentence_of_jadhav , adding that islamabad promulgated_the_ordinance , under which he and india were invited_to_file_review proceedings before the islamabad_high_court . " neither has done so till_date . accordingly , to comply_with the directive of the icj , the federation has filed_a_petition in the islamabad_high_court for appointment_of_a_lawyer_for commander_jadhav , so that the review_proceedings can be initiated , " said pakistan foreign_office_spokesperson .   india took the case up to the icj , which halted the death_sentence of jadhav and asked pakistan to provide_consular_access as_well_as ensure_effective review_and_reconsideration_of_his_sentence . pakistan , in line with the icj_ruling , provided india consular_access_to_jadhav twice - first on september 2 , 2019 and then on july_16 . islamabad

when a man says ' no ' he too means ' no ' when a man says ' no ' he too means ' no '   does the right to say ' no ' belong only to the fair sex ? does the man not have the right to say no ? if and when he says ' no ' , does he not mean ' no ' ? why do i ask , you say ? well let_me narrate to you this incident .   there was this little cottage in a serene forest , by the river , where lived a tall , dark and handsome young_man . he lived there happily with his_wife and younger_brother . one day , a young widow * came that way . on seeing this good looking man , she fell_in_love him ! she was a pot - bellied lady with protruding eyes and had long nails . she approached him and said , " my name is Shurpanakha . i have highly_placed powerful brothers and they have mighty armies . " then she went on to confess her love for him and proposed to marry him .   "         |   " i_am happily_married to my_dear wife Seeta . oh honorable one , i_do_n't_think you will be happy to be a co - wife .   " since i can not marry you , why_do_n't_you rather marry my younger_brother ?

"   Shurpankha , with wavering feelings for both men , finally_decided to settle for the elder one . since rama would n't marry_her as long as his_wife was alive , she said ,   "       |   let_me eat this wife of yours , right in front of your eyes . once she is gone , you will become free from her . then we both can make merry without the botheration of a co - wife . "   so saying she rushed towards the wide eyed terrified Seeta . seeing that Shurpanakha was a cannibal , Lakshamana , stopped her from harming Seeta and punished Shurpanakha by cutting_off her nose .   wailing loudly , she who refused to take ' no ' for answer , ran to her brothers Khara and Dushana for help . they along with their army attacked the duo rama and Lakshmana .   so much for saying

china leads the way on global standards for 5_g and beyond china leads the way on global standards for 5_g and beyond -   china leads the way on global standards for 5_g and beyond   huawei moves front and center as beijing drafts strategy on rule - setting   china 's huawei_technologies has become the top filer of standards - essential 5_g patents .   HIDEAKI RYUGEN and HIROYUKI AKIYAMA , nikkei staff writers   tokyo -- china has become a central player in writing international rules for emerging_technologies , particularly fifth - generation wireless , as part of a national effort to shape the playing_field in its favor .   the country is reportedly drafting a medium - term strategy dubbed " china standards 2035 , " complementing the " made in china 2025 " industrial modernization plan under which it has cultivated such fields as 5_g and artificial_intelligence . but as distrust toward beijing mounts , its growing dominance of the standards discussion risks becoming another source of friction .   china submitted 830 technical documents_related to wired communications specifications to the international_telecommunication_union last_year , the most of any country and more_than the next three -- south_korea , the u.s. and japan -- combined , according to an industry group . such documents serve as a basis for deliberation on new standards , and more papers mean more of a voice .   china is the fifth - largest_contributor to the itu 's budget as well . the organization 's chinese leader , secretary - general zhao Houlin , was previously involved in developing telecom standards for the chinese government and has pledged to step up cooperation with beijing 's belt_and_road infrastructure initiative .   aside from telecommunications , china was behind 16 of the 65 proposals for new technical committees at the international organization for standardization and the international Electrotechnical commission since_2014 , the japanese industrial standards committee found . these committees draft specifications for specific fields , with the leader typically hailing from the country that made the proposal .   china now also leads the iec as a whole , as shu Yinbiao became president in january .   the u.s. , alarmed by the prospect of beijing writing the rules , has moved to decouple chinese_tech_companies from american business . washington last_year essentially ordered u.s. companies to stop doing_business with huawei_technologies on security grounds . while the u.k. and france have begun taking a tougher line on huawei , such moves can not entirely eliminate china 's influence in 5g.   huawei is the top filer of standard - essential patents for 5_g , according to the tokyo - based cyber creative institute . it leads in 5g - related contributions to 3GPP , an international organization that develops telecom standards

chinas home - grown large amphibious aircraft AG600 makes 1st sea - based test flight by liu Xuanzun and ma jun source : global_times_published : 2020/7/26 12:17:04   china 's domestically_developed large amphibious aircraft AG600 makes its first sea - based test flight from sea waters off qingdao , east china 's shandong_province on july_26 , 2020 . photo : courtesy of avic   china 's domestically_developed large amphibious aircraft AG600 successfully made its first sea - based test flight on sunday . the test flight demonstrated the aircraft 's ability to operate in challenging maritime conditions and conduct missions , including far sea cargo transport and maritime emergency rescue , the aircraft 's developer said .   analysts said the aircraft 's potential deployment in the south_china_sea will enhance china 's ability to safeguard_national_sovereignty and territorial_integrity , as its future presence would contribute to china 's civil_administration practice in the region , and help in search_and_rescue missions for those in need from other countries in a move that shows china 's image as a responsible_major_country .   the AG600 aircraft_took_off from waters near the coastal_city of qingdao , east china 's shandong_province , on sunday_morning . it was on show for around 31 minutes and finished a set of test maneuvers in the sky , before_landing at an airport in Rizhao , shandong_province .   the event_marked the success of the AG600 's first sea - based test flight , the aircraft 's developer aviation_industry corp of china ( avic ) said in a statement sent to the global_times on sunday .   the AG600 conducted its land - based maiden_flight in zhuhai , south china 's guangdong_province , in december of 2017 , and its first water - based test flight over a reservoir in Jingmen , central china 's hubei_province in october of 2018 .   the aircraft 's sea - based test flight demonstrated its performance in sea waves and corrosive environments that have high salinity and humidity , said avic .   avic said that sea water is different to fresh waters in terms of salinity , density and waves , and the pilot also faced more complicated environments , meaning that sea - based test flights are much_harder compared_to_previous water - based test flights .   it also prepared the aircraft to conduct missions , including far sea cargo transport and maritime emergency rescue , in the future , the company said .   wang ya'nan , a chinese aviation_industry expert and chief editor of the aerospace knowledge magazine , told_the_global_times_on_sunday that previous water - based test flights took_place in a reservoir that was safe and did_not have large waves .   a test flight at sea is more challenging as uncontrollable factors come_into_play , including waves and corrosions that could possibly cause
cpec : an economic blunder or part of china 's expansion_plans growth of its economy is the ultimate_goal of any policymaker across the world . growth makes the economy stronger , creates more efficient and content society producing more , which in turn allows for a larger military . the military , on_the_other_hand , is used to produce something hardly measurable   security . that , in turn , has various_aspects   access to necessary strategic resources or securing land , free from foreign or local shocks , where the population , not worrying about basic survival threats , can thrive and produce .   there is only one problem here   the military does_not produce anything tangible . it is only a cost incurring part of the society and larger spending as percent of the gdp slow the economy , because less resources are used for reinvestment and improvement of production capabilities . the economy can theoretically exist without the military , but realistically , in the long_run it can_not_withstand the internal_and_external shocks . the military , understandably , can not survive alone as the people in it have to live somehow . because of all this , both_sides are interconnected and need each_other .   as_a_result , any strategic plan of a nation would require strategic steps in both directions- such paving the road for economic_growth and such securing the growth by appropriate military backing . ironically , wealth production of the nation comes at the cost of its trading_partners or neighbors as it is something man made , not god granted .   meet china in late 2012 . the party has to elect a new general_secretary and later a new president of the country . a low_key , quiet and determined character is chosen   xi_jinping . over the course of the next couple_of_years , a new foreign_policy is crafted   harder_line on security issues and foreign_affairs , a more nationalistic and assertive china and one that is united and confident of its value system and political structure .   the building of a stronger and more confident china , however , would require something that would secure the growth of the nation , the production of the resources and possibly the expansion of the country . the later might_sound outrageous to many , but considering the communist roots , it would be foolish to ignore it as the whole communist idea is based on the premises of expansion .

Gorgain baloch , the leader of bso pajjar , has condemned the abduction of the ost welfare 's chairman jan muhammad dashti by pakistani army . even those who devote their lives to serve people are not safe in pakistan , he said .   whereas , nasrullah baloch , the chairman of voice_for_baloch_missing_persons , has expressed_concern_over the disappearance of the chairman of ost welfare . nasrullah baloch demanded to the government to produce , abdul_qayyum and muhammad jan dashti to the courts if they are involve in illegal_activities , he further said that they should_be_given a fair_trial in accordance_with the laws of the country . it it is unconstitutional to torture the people and their families , he expressed .   enforced_disappearances that started in the early_2000s have never slowed_down in balochistan , in fact , baloch are now being abducted from outside balochistan , numerous people every year become victims_of_enforced_disappearances .   local and international campaign groups including human_rights_watch and amnesty_international accuse pakistani security_forces as the culprits of these illegal_detentions .   pakistan to implement a single_national_curriculum in 2021   panjgur : baloch political workers ' houses attacked   the baloch students organization has always played_a_crucial_role in ...   the chairperson of the baloch_national_movement , khalil baloch , said that the cruelties of the pakistan army are unabated in the width ...   the counter_terrorism_department ( ctd ) has claimed that four members of the sindhudesh_revolutionary_army ( sra ) involved in several militant_attacks including ...   a controversial character in both eastern_and_western parts of balochistan , mullah umar , was killed
kohala_hydro_power_project is open plunder of pok resources : habib - ur - rehman map of jammu_&_kashmir and ladakh .   former jammu_and_kashmir people 's national party ( JKPNP ) spokesman habib - ur - rehman denounced the proposed   kohala_hydro_power_project at kohala in pakistan - occupied_kashmir ( pok )   and said that this hydroelectric_project is an attempt by china and pakistan to seize the resources from this part of kashmir and end its present status .   " there is a plan to disarm azad_jammu_and_kashmir ( pakistan - occupied_jammu kashmir ) by seizing the resources of this part of the state as_well_as to seize it completely and end its present status , " said habib - ur - rehman .   he explained that the construction of   mangla_dam in the 1960s ,   then the neelum_jhelum power_project ( NJPP ) and now the kohala_hydro_power_project have not involved public_opinion and the so - called government of azad_jammu_and_kashmir ( pok ) had no role in it . " it is the process by which the resources of this part of the state are being plundered . apparently it is being announced that it will provide_employment to the people while in fact the people are being deprived of their resources . large water dams in the world are considered harmful to the environment , not only humans but also birds will be badly_affected , people will face immense_difficulties , " said habib - ur - rehman .   habib - ur - rehman further added that this dam is primarily owned by the people of azad_jammu_and_kashmir ( pakistan - occupied_kashmir ) and according to the state laws , no person , company or corporation which does_not_fall_under the category of state subject roll can invest in jammu_and_kashmir .   talking_about the ajk ( pok ) government , habib - ur - rehman said that the government and the members of the assembly were taking concessions to give a thumbs_up to all such agreements with the so - called azad_jammu_and_kashmir government . the pakistani rulers , azad_jammu_and_kashmir 's prime_minister are witnesses the loot of resources . " surprisingly , they are becoming witnesses to the alienation of their land . "   the former spokesperson of JKPNP reminded that the ruling_class of pakistan has ruined the baloch people by plundering the resources of balochistan . the looting of sindh 's resources continues , and so there_is_an_urgent_need to learn_a_lesson from history . instead of the ajk ( pok ) government having complete control over the resources of the so - called " azad_jammu_and_kashmir " , the ajk ( pok ) government is wasting their time in flattery and welcome . " they are giving their lands to others for small posts . "   habib - ur - rehman warned that as several

Bargiel is the only man who has managed to ski from the summit of the iconic k2 to its base_camp . a documentary on the 32 - year - old pole 's journey , ' k2 : the impossible descent ' , is being released on   on wednesday , the second anniversary of his momentous achievement .   " the idea to ski down the k2 came to me when i had a glimpse of it during the first successful ski descent of broad peak in 2015 , " the ski mountaineer told_dawn in a zoom interview arranged by red bull last_week .   " i first attempted the ski descent on k2 in 2017 but had to abandon that [ after high winds blew away his skis ] before i managed to make it happen a year later . "   on july_22 , 2018 , at 7 pm local time , having been all alone in the perils and the wilderness of k2   the world 's second - highest_peak which at 8,611 metres is just 200_metres shorter than the everest   for more_than 15 hours , Bargiel turned up at the base_camp with a full recording of his descent .   those 15 hours included a near eight - hour climb to the summit from camp iv , without supplemental oxygen .   " most fears , i 'd left_behind at home , " said Bargiel , when_asked_about how he felt when he went solo from camp iv . " when you 're preparing for the expedition , that 's when you 're thinking_about how things would go but when you 're there , fear is a distant feeling .

"   " the prime_minister 's observations that there_was_no_chinese_presence on our side of the lac pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery_of_our_armed_forces , " the pmo said .   the remarks come after several opposition_leaders , including congress_leaders rahul_gandhi and p_chidambaram said pm_modi 's comments were " baffling " as they stand in contradiction to what defence_minister_rajnath_singh , foreign_minister_jaishankar and the indian_army has said so_far about the galwan_clash .   pmo has clarified , " ... words of prime_minister ' those who tried to transgress our land were taught a befitting lesson by our brave_sons of soil ' , succinctly summed_up the ethos and the values of our armed_forces . "   chidambaram said on saturday prime_minister_narendra_modi 's remark that no outsider was inside_indian_territory in ladakh , had practically left everyone " baffled and bewildered " .   chidambaram said even after the pm 's statement on friday , china had blamed india for the clashes and had re - asserted its
100 books banned for carrying blasphemous , anti - pak content 100 books banned for carrying blasphemous , anti - pak content   the curriculum board of pakistan 's punjab_province has imposed an immediate ban on at_least 100 books with a plan of banning many more being_taught_in_private_schools for carrying blasphemous and anti - pakistan content   the punjab_curriculum & textbook_board 's ( pctb ) managing_director raj manzoor_hussain_nasir , took the decision on thursday , stating that it had been reviewing at_least 10,000_books_being taught by private_schools_across_the_province . "in the first_phase , pctb has banned 100 books of 31 publishers including oxford_and_cambridge for blasphemous , immoral and anti - pakistan content , " he said .   " the pctb has formed 30 committees for this purpose . "nasir said that critical review of the books revealed that " distorted_facts about pakistan and its creation , quaid - e - azam_muhammad_ali_jinnah and allama_muhammad_iqbal were being taught to the children " , while many books also contained " blasphemous_content " .   one important part of the review revelations by pctb was that many books portrayed pakistan as inferior to india while pakistan_occupied_kashmir ( pok ) was shown as part of india in maps of some books also .   " instead of including sayings of quaid - e - azam_muhammad_ali_jinnah and allama_muhammad_iqbal , one of the books carried sayings of mahatma_gandhi and some unknown people , " said nasir .   " in a book of mathematics counting concepts were made explained to the young students showing_pictures of pigs . one of the books by cambridge tried to promote crime and violence among the students on the basis of unemployment in the country . "taking immediate notice of the matter , at_least 100 books have been banned immediately with publishers directed to stop_publishing and selling them books .   moreover , district education authorities ( DEAs ) across the province have been directed to visit private_schools ( after reopening ) to check if the banned_books are still being taught . "first investigation report ( fir ) will be registered against publishers for violations under provisions of punjab_curriculum_and_textbook_board act 2015 , " he said .   the step taken by the punjab government is likely to be implemented by other provinces in the country in the coming_days as pakistan looks_forward to challenge the curriculum structure of big_names like oxford_and_cambridge . critical review of at_least 10,000_books is in process , which would increase the number of banned_books a lot higher in the coming_days .   educationists have said that pctb should have had a mechanism of scrutiny of books in place before letting them be published as 30 committees , along with dea visits to over 97,000 schools in punjab_province , would be a very time_consuming task .   dish network secures broadcast rights

gop seeks sanctions on chinese_hackers stealing coronavirus_vaccine info leading republican_lawmakers are pressing the trump_administration to issue new sanctions on china for its attempts_to_hack proprietary information from the united_states about the coronavirus and possible vaccines_being_developed .   reps . michael_mccaul ( r. , texas ) , greg Walden ( r. , ore. ) , and patrick mchenry ( r. , n.c. ) petitioned the trump_administration on monday to provide them with a classified briefing detailing the " scope , number , and success rates " of chinese - sponsored hack attacks on america . they are also seeking information on whether the treasury_department is working on sanctions that would target these state - backed_hackers .   the lawmakers accuse past administrations of failing to take_action_against chinese_hackers as part of a bid to foster closer_relations with the communist government . " by decades of not taking principled stands or enforcing violations of commitments , the united_states has allowed the ccp to proceed down another path , which threatens u.s. and global security , " they wrote in a   sent to the white_house .   recent reports_indicate that chinese government - backed_hackers have stepped_up their attacks on the u.s. government and medical_research institutions that are working on vaccines for the coronavirus .   the lawmakers argue that new sanctions are needed to send_a_message to china that these hacks will_not_be_tolerated . the treasury_department , they said , has failed to take adequate action in recent_years .   " treasury has not sufficiently imposed such sanctions on prc actors for cyber_attacks on americans or those entities in the prc that benefit from cyber - enabled theft of intellectual_property , but we believe that time may be ripe for considering such action , " the letter said .   the lawmakers warn that these attacks will continue to increase until the united_states takes concrete_action .   california county to sue governor over covid restrictions   study : religious voters object to coronavirus crackdown on worship   new photos reveal newsom lied_about posh napa valley dinner   synagogues say cuomo 's covid rules discriminate_against jews   conservative journalist successfully sues state of minnesota for access to coronavirus briefings
three actions ceos can take to get value from cloud_computing leaders need to accelerate their journey to the cloud in order to digitize quickly and effectively in the wake of covid-19 .   if you are a ceo ,   you already know what the cloud can do for your business in a post - covid-19 world . you 've probably even told your organization to get you there already . so why is your move to the cloud   in this article , we use " cloud " to refer to the public cloud rather_than companies ' private clouds , in which they attempt_to_create highly automated and virtualized application - hosting environments on premises .   coming along so slowly , even_though you may have been talking_about it for years ? it might be because you and your management team have yet to take a sufficiently active_role , or provide the air cover your chief information officer ( cio ) and chief_technology_officer ( cto ) need .   cios and CTOs are on the front foot right now thanks to their   during the covid-19 pandemic . that makes this a good moment to further elevate top - team support for the cloud enablement needed to   , the digitization of the company , its channels of distribution , and its supply chainsall of which   to be moving more quickly than they were .   the ceo 's role is crucial because no_one_else can broker across the multiple parties involved , which include the cio , cto , cfo , chief human - resources officer ( CHRO ) , chief information security officer ( CISO ) , and business - unit leads . as we explain in this article , the transition to cloud_computing represents a   one that requires a coordinated_effort across the team at the top of an organization . it 's a matter of   , in other words , and only ceos can wield the baton .   to get to cloud more quickly , ceos should ask their cio and cto what support they need to lead the organization on the journey . chances are good that three interventions will emerge :   establishing a sustainable funding model to support the investments required to get business value from the cloud   that exploits cloud for speed , agility , and efficient scalability   putting_in_place the hr , compensation , and location policies required to attract and retain the specialized engineering talent required to operate in the cloud   together , these interventions will help the executive team unite around a coherent point_of_view about the business - driven value that the cloud represents , how to capture that value , and how to evolve the company 's operating

will non - aligned india break oath under us lure ? will non - aligned india break oath under us lure ?   indian external_affairs_minister s. jaishankar on monday said that " non - alignment was a term of a particular era and geopolitical_landscape " but new_delhi will never be part of an alliance . he said global shifts were opening spaces for middle powers including india . " but countries who depended more on the us are finding they have to take a call themselves on many issues , " he noted .   jaishankar 's words imply that india will never become a treaty ally of the us and that india will not bind itself into the us alliance system .   actually , cooperation between india and us in many fields can be labeled moves that allies make between themselves . for example , in the domain of security and defense , at_least in the indo - pacific_region , india has sided with the us . however , in terms of diplomatic rhetoric , new_delhi does_not define itself as an ally of washington .   india believes such strategy gives it greater diplomatic and strategic space .   not being a us ally , india need n't assume responsibility toward the us . therefore india can deal with its relations_with_other_countries with more flexibility . this will help india maximize its interests .   india is the founder of the non - aligned movement . however , there has been speculation that india would change its diplomacy of non - alignment , which is a political heritage of the indian_national_congress , instead of the ruling_bharatiya_janata_party . actually , india is inclined to multi - alignments , but in diplomatically it has to underline its non - alignment position .   when tensions are ramping_up between china and india , india seems to be moving_closer to the us . for example , washington and new_delhi held navy drills near the andaman_and_nicobar archipelago on monday . besides , although india and the us have not effectively put the spread of the deadly covid-19 under control , the indian government has approved of resuming us passenger_flights to india starting july_23 .   these moves seem to go against jaishankar 's statement . india says one thing , but does another . even_though india claims not to part of any alliance , its practice shows that it is inclined to the us . this also shows india 's other consideration .   when china - india relations deteriorate , indian nationalism would become strong , spurring some indians to pursue a path to decouple_from china . to compensate for the economic loss of decoupling from china , india has to seek closer economic_ties with other economies such as the us . but given

what imran_khan is doing to pakistani school_textbooks even zia - ul - haq did_n't the huge volume of religious material the proposed single_national_curriculum contains beats all previous_version 's in pakistan 's history .   pakistan pm_imran_khan | facebook file_photo | @Imrankhanofficial   e prepared , pakistan ! imran_khan 's government is poised to inflict_damage upon this country 's education system in a manner never_seen_before . its so - called single_national_curriculum ( snc ) hides systemic changes going far deeper than the ones conceived and executed by the extremist regime of gen_zia - ul - haq . implementation is scheduled for 2021 .   at_first_glance a uniform national_curriculum is hugely attractive . some see it striking a lethal blow at the abominable education apartheid that has wracked pakistan from day one . by the year , a widening_gap has separated beneficiaries of elite private education from those crippled by bad public schooling . so what could be better_than the rich child and the poor child studying the same subjects from the same books and being judged by the same standards ?   but this morally attractive idea has been hijacked , corrupted , mutilated and beaten out of shape by those near - sighted persons now holding pakistan 's future in their hands , and who , like their boss , kowtow to the madressah establishment . prime_minister khan was widely_criticised in 2016 - 17 for making huge grants to madressahs of the late maulana Samiul haq , self - professed father of the taliban who was murdered by an associate in mysterious_circumstances .   imran_khan trolls ' unfortunate ' india over covid surge , but pakistan conducts 21 % fewer_tests   as yet only snc plans for class i - v are public . but the huge volume of religious material they contain beats all curriculums in pakistan 's history . a column - by - column comparison with two major madressah systems   Tanzeemul madaris and Rabtaul madaris   reveals a shocking fact . ordinary schools will henceforth impose more rote_learning than even these madressahs . normal schoolteachers being under - equipped religiously , snc calls for summoning an army of madressah - educated holy men   hafiz 's and qaris   as paid teachers inside schools . how this will affect the general ambiance and the safety of students is an open question .   the push for a uniform national_curriculum idea derives from three flawed assumptions :   first : it is false that quality differences_between pakistan 's various education streams stem from pursuing different curricula . when teaching any secular subject such as geography , social studies or science , all streams have to cover the same topics . while details and emphases obviously differ , each must deal with exactly seven continents and

in china 's troop_movements in ladakh 's depth_areas , a hint about its real plan india has moved 12 t-90 tanks ,   armoured_personnel_carriers and 4,000 soldiers to daulat_beg_oldi to prevent any chinese_aggression(ht_photo )   with the chinese people 's_liberation_army ( pla ) deploying close to 50,000 troops in aksai_chin , the indian_army   for the first time has deployed a squadron ( 12 ) t-90 missile_firing tanks , armoured_personnel_carriers ( apcs ) and a full troop brigade ( 4,000 men ) at daulat_beg_oldi ( dbo ) to prevent any chinese_aggression from the shaksgam - karakoram_pass axis , according to top military_commanders familiar_with the matter .   as some bridges on the darbuk - shyok - dbo_road can not handle the weight of a 46 ton t-90 tank , the indian_army_commanders sent the t-90 tanks after the june_15 galwan flare - up by fording the rivers and rivulets using specialized equipment . the armoured_personnel_carriers ( apcs ) or infantry_combat_vehicles , m_777 155_mm howitzers , and 130_mm guns had_already_been sent to dbo after chinese_aggression at patrolling_points_14 , 15 , 16 , 17 and the pangong_tso finger features .   while india and china have decided to first totally disengage and then de - escalate from the area , the indian_army is not only matching troop_strength but also keenly watching the pla deployment of tanks , air_defence radars and surface_to_air_missiles in aksai_chin .   the disengagement is work - in - progress with each side verifying the movements of the other , the commanders , who_asked_not_to_be_identified said .   while the indian military has also decided to black - top the advance landing_ground at dbo , the main_reason for deploying tanks in the area is to prevent any sudden chinese move from the north , they added .

( at weddings , this suffering is on top of that already caused by the extremely loud , traumatising noise of drums and trumpets . ) the crude bits have metal spikes sticking out of them   and so are often_referred_to_as " thorn bits " , as they act like a line of thorns piercing the horses ' sensitive mouths . recent investigations by peta india found horses with spiked bits embedded more_than a centimetre deep in their_mouths , ripping their lips and tongues and causing them extreme pain , bloody wounds , immense psychological_trauma , and lifelong damage . such use of the bits is rampant , even_though it 's prohibited under rule 8 of the prevention of cruelty to Draught and pack animals rules , 1965 .   in response to the findings of a multi - state survey of government efforts to enforce india 's ban on the use of spiked bits on horses , peta india has written to the chief_secretaries of states_and_union_territories including assam , bihar , delhi , gujarat , haryana , himachal_pradesh , karnataka , madhya_pradesh , maharashtra , punjab , rajasthan , telangana , uttarakhand , and uttar_pradesh requesting that they take_action_against the illegal practice . several governments   including those of assam , bihar , delhi , karnataka , and telangana   have issued_orders mandating the enforcement of the ban .   in light of our investigations into the   abuse of horses for weddings   and other ceremonies , delhi police   assisted by peta india   confiscated more_than_100 illegal spiked bits   and filed non - cognisable_offence reports against many horse owners .   as public_awareness of the cruelty inherent in using spiked bits grows , numerous wedding parties are now opting for horse - free transportation , including walking , arriving on a royal enfield bullet or harley - davidson or in a vintage car or ferrari , or even dropping in by helicopter . high - profile   celebrity couples whose weddings were horse - free   include shahid_kapoor and mira rajput , neil nitin mukesh and Rukmini sahay , zaheer khan and Sagarika Ghatge , neha_dhupia and angad_bedi , anushka_sharma and virat_kohli , and sonam_kapoor and anand_ahuja .   join peta india in calling on the governments of states_and_union_territories to put_an_end to the use of illegal spiked bits to control horses for weddings , other ceremonies , and rides .   government of the NCT of delhi   ministry of animal_husbandry , uttarakhand   directorate of ah & veterinary
Experimenters trap small animals in Beakers of water until they stop swimming Experimenters trap small animals in Beakers of water until they stop swimming   the forced swim test is a widely_used experiment that 's as cruel as it is worthless . in this test , experimenters put mice , rats , guinea pigs , hamsters , or gerbils in inescapable containers filled with water . the panicked animals try to escape by attempting to climb up the sides of the beakers or even diving underwater in search of an exit . they paddle furiously , desperately_trying to keep their heads above water . eventually , they 'll start to float .   some form of this test has been carried_out since at_least the 1950s , when notorious   experimenter Curt richter forced rats to swim in cylinders of water until they drowned . it was popularised in 1977 by an experimenter named roger Porsolt , who called it the " behavioral despair test " . Porsolt found that rats who 'd been given human antidepressant drugs would struggle and swim for longer than other rats before starting to float , and he concluded that those who swam for less time were in a state of " despair " . but the test has been heavily_criticised by other scientists who argue that floating is not a sign of despair but rather a positive sign of learning , conserving energy , and adapting to a new environment .   more_than_40_years later , in university and pharmaceutical laboratories , animals are being dosed with drugs and then dropped into cylinders of water so that experimenters can measure how long they struggle .   pharmaceutical_giant eli lilly has subjected at_least 3,201 mice and 234 rats to the cruel forced swim test   as documented in 19 published papers and 11 patent_applications between 1993 and 2018 .   peta us scientists identified 47 compounds that had been tested by four major pharmaceuticals companies and found that even_though 36 of them showed promise as having antidepressant characteristics using the archaic forced swim test , none of these compounds is currently approved to treat human depression .   the forced swim test does_n't accurately predict_whether a drug will work as a human antidepressant . it yields positive_results for compounds that are n't prescribed as human antidepressants , such as caffeine , and negative_results for compounds that are . importantly , antidepressant compounds that might work in humans may be mistakenly abandoned based on the test .   the bottom_line : the forced swim test is bad science . these experiments do nothing more_than terrify animals and delay development of new effective_treatments that are so desperately_needed .   after discussions with peta us , some of the world 's leading pharmaceutical giants   including johnson_&_johnson ,

( aly_song / reuters / file )   december 7 , 2018 at 7:33 pm_est   in october_2017 , the brookings_institution , one of washington 's most_prestigious think_tanks ,   a report entitled " benefits and best_practices of safe city innovation . " the report included a case study praising the kenyan capital nairobi and the chinese city of Lijiang for implementing new technology in policing .   what the report failed to mention is that the controversial chinese telecommunications giant_huawei   the technology for both cities , or that huawei is one of the   sellers of safe city equipment , which the company   as " cutting - edge " security to improve policing and oversight . the brookings report did , at_least , disclose who provided support for the research : " support for this publication was generously provided by huawei . " in other words , brookings praised huawei 's technology in a report sponsored by huawei .

" brookings will not accept gifts from donors who seek to undermine the independence of its scholars ' research or otherwise to predetermine or influence recommendations .

pakistan warns tiktok_video service , blocks bigo_live app islamabad ( ap )   pakistan has threatened china 's tiktok and blocked the singapore - based bigo_live streaming_platform , citing what the regulating authority called widespread complaints about " immoral , obscene_and_vulgar " content on the apps .   the move was promptly decried by pakistani rights_activists who saw it as a potential precursor to an even greater censorship in this conservative muslim nation .   in a statement , the pakistan_telecommunications_authority said the content on the two platforms could have " extremely_negative_effects on the society in general and youth in particular , " without_elaborating .   a tweet on monday from the regulating authority said it had complained to the companies behind the platforms but that " the response of these companies has not been satisfactory . "   both tiktok , a video - sharing app owned by beijing tech_giant bytedance , and bigo_live , a live_streaming platform owned by a singapore company , are popular among pakistani teens and young_adults .   " the government is testing the ground to what extent they can go in censoring , " shahzad ahmad of islamabad - based social_media rights group BytesForAll said in a telephone_interview on tuesday .   tiktok has especially grown in popularity among the country 's young , which make up nearly_70 % of the 220_million_population , ahmad said . " this is the start of more censorship . "   he said pakistan is taking its cue_from china , which he accused of seeking to control the free_flow_of_information . communication_links feature prominently in beijing 's multi - billion_dollar one - road project_linking south_and_central_asia to china .   a big component in pakistan 's part of the project , known as the china_pakistan_economic_corridor , is an optic fiber_cable connecting khunjerab , on the pakistani border with china , to rawalpindi near the capital , islamabad . the cable is eventually to be laid across all of pakistan .   " when you can control cyberspace you control the narrative as well , " ahmad said , adding that in the past , pakistan 's tech - savvy young have found ways to circumvent bans .   the regulating authority insists the move is about content deemed offensive . both companies have been asked " to moderate the socialization and content within the legal_and_moral limits , in accordance_with the laws of the country , " the statement said .   pakistan is also asking tiktok and bigo_live to " put_in_place_a_comprehensive_mechanism to control_obscenity , vulgarity_and_immorality_through_its_social media applications . "   over the years , pakistan has forwarded hundreds of complaints to facebook_and_twitter about content , alleging it is offensive and potentially insulting to islam , which goes against pakistani law .   in 2008 ,

the benefits of advancing workplace gender_equality in asia manage products and account information   a particular focus on asia in this research and some pretty   stunning numbers that you dug up and came out with as an   incentive to try and encourage businesses and governments to   implement greater gender_equality in the workplace . what are   the potential economic dividends . should we get to a place   where gender_equality is put_in_place in the workplace or in   it 's a pretty big opportunity . it 's worth four point three   trillion_dollars in asia . if women were to participate more   equally to men in the workplace and that 's not full equality   that 's actually more of what we call a best in region scenario .   so we looked historically over the last_10_years at every_single   region and the country that had made the most improvement in   that region over the last_10_years . and then we matched that   rate of improvement . so in asia that would be improving gender   equality at the rate of singapore in western_europe improving at   the rate of spain in latin_america improving at the rate of   argentina . and when you do that that 's when asia would achieve   that four point three trillion_dollars . about 60_percent of it   is from greater workforce participation from women . so just   more women getting into the formal workplace . about 20 percent   of it is from greater part time or better part time versus full   time mix around the world women have the majority of part time   jobs in the minority of full_time_jobs . in the last 20 percent   of that four point three trillion is through sector mix . so men   tend to be concentrated in higher average output per employee   sectors and women in lower average output per employee sectors .   and if that were to more equalize that would drive the last 20   percent of that four point three trillion . that 's 12 percent of   gdp over the course of 10 years . it 's the equivalent of adding   the economies of germany and austria to asia gdp . so it 's a   to what extent does it break down across the region . and i   guess the key question is what are the policy prescriptions that   you would advise policymakers and businesses to consider to get   to the point where we are getting gender_equality in the   workplace . yeah . so across the region across asia

star market expected to nurture leading global tech_firms shanghai : china 's nasdaq - style sci - tech innovation board , also_known_as the star market , is expected to nurture world - class technology companies in china , considering its astonishing growth in the past year .   the star market marked its first_anniversary on wednesday , having been inaugurated on july_22 last_year . so_far , the star market has raised about 217.9 billion_yuan ( about 31 billion u.s. dollars ) for 140 listed enterprises . several leading tech_firms , such as SMIC and national silicon industry group , have a market value of about 100 billion_yuan .   SMIC , china 's leading semiconductor manufacturer , was listed on the market on july_16 .   it obtained approval for its ipo from chinese regulators in 19 days and entered the board in just 46 days , reflecting the fast - track approach and constant innovations of the board 's listing system .   on april_30 , china 's top securities regulator adjusted the threshold for innovative red - chip companies , allowing overseas - listed innovative red chips to apply for domestic listing if they have a capitalization of 20 billion_yuan or above and are in possession of self - developed and world - leading technologies as_well_as innovative strengths .   gao Yonggang , chief_financial_officer of SMIC , said that , thanks to the policy adjustments , SMIC can return to the a - share market .   " we had not met the requirements of the previous threshold , which required capitalization of 200 billion_yuan for red - chip companies . the government timely revised the threshold for foreign - listed_companies to return to a shares , which paved_the_way_for SMIC to make its debut on the star market , " said gao .   according to mandy zhu , head of china global banking of ubs , the multiple listing criteria of the star market are more flexible and provide diversified paths for loss - making companies and companies with dual - class share structures to enter the market .   qi an xin technology group inc. , a chinese network - security service firm listed on the star market on wednesday , is one of the beneficiaries .   " the star market has changed the listing criteria from sustainable profitability to sustainable operating ability , which allows companies with core technologies and a long cash - conversion cycle like us to successfully go public and further expand with the strength of the capital market , " said qi Xiangdong , chairman and ceo of qi an xin .   more and more enterprises see a promising_future in the star market and are choosing dual listing in shanghai and hong_kong . chinese automaker Geely automobile holdings limited

u.s. secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo may be in an uproar over russia 's nord stream 2 pipeline , but it is hardly the geopolitical masterstroke for putin he imagines pompeo may be in an uproar over russia 's nord stream 2 pipeline , but it is hardly the geopolitical masterstroke he imagines .   a man_wearing a hard hat walks by the central facility where the nord stream baltic sea gas_pipeline reaches western_europe in Lubmin , germany , on nov. 8 , 2011 .   " get out now , or risk the consequences , " u.s. secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo declared last_week to companies facilitating the construction of the nord stream 2 gas_pipeline . the project to build a second set of pipes under the baltic sea from russia directly to germany has been delayed by u.s. sanctions , but it is on track to be finished in the coming_months . now , the united_states is threatening new sanctions in a last - ditch effort to impede the pipeline 's construction . " companies aiding_and_abetting russia 's malign - influence projects , " pompeo insisted , " will_not_be_tolerated . "   as the united_states deepens its pressure campaign against nord stream 2 , friction with germany , which would receive much of the pipeline 's gas , will intensify . washington is far from alone in criticizing nord stream 2 , of course . many countries in central_and_eastern_europe see the pipeline as a glaring_example of german hypocrisy , as berlin lectures them about carbon neutrality and human_rights while guzzling fossil_fuels from one of the most authoritarian country on the continent . but german_chancellor_angela_merkel is dead set on finishing the pipeline to appease her country 's powerful corporate lobbies . germany has pushed the european_union to   u.s. sanctions on nord stream 2 " unacceptable " and " contrary to international_law . " in turn , pompeo 's promise of yet more sanctions will exacerbate washington 's already_strained relations with the eu 's leading member state .   it is worth asking , therefore , whether those in the trump_administration advocating sanctions on nord stream 2 are right that the project will substantially enhance russia 's influence in europe . u.s. sen. ted_cruz is clearly correct in calling the project " putin 's pipeline . " although some of the pipeline 's backers continue to insist that the pipeline is purely "   that there are " political_considerations " behind the gas project .   among the " political_considerations " that must be considered in assessing the pipeline is the corruption of germany 's own political_elite . the fact that merkel 's predecessor Gerhard Schrder   the board of nord stream AG51 percent   by russia 's state - owned gas firm , Gazpromis evidence that something may be rotten in the political system that prides_itself on

hagia_sophia : erdogan , thousands of worshippers attend first friday_prayers istanbul : turkey 's president_tayyip_erdogan joined thousands of worshippers at hagia_sophia on friday for the first prayers there since he declared the monument a mosque once_again .   erdogan and his top ministers , wearing white facemasks as_a_precaution_against covid-19 , knelt on blue carpets at the start of a ceremony which marks the return of muslim worship to the ancient monument .   earlier , crowds formed at checkpoints around the historic heart of istanbul where massed police maintained security . once through the checks , worshippers sat apart on prayer_mats in secured areas outside the building in Sultanahmet square .   " we are ending our 86 years of longing today , " said one man Sait Colak , referring to the nearly nine decades since hagia_sophia was declared a museum and ceased to be a place_of_worship . " thanks to our president and the court decision , today we are going to have our friday_prayers in hagia_sophia . "   turkish_president tayyip_erdogan visits hagia sofia after reconversion to mosque   a top turkish court announced this month it annulled hagia_sophia 's status as a museum . erdogan immediately turned back into a mosque a building which was a christian byzantine cathedral for 900 years before being seized by ottoman conquerors and serving as a mosque until 1934 .   the president was set to attend_friday_prayers shortly_after 1 pm ( 1000_gmt ) with several_hundred invitees for the ceremony in the sixth - century building . a large screen and speakers were set_up in the square to broadcast proceedings to the thousands gathered_outside .   as crowds grew , leaving little space for social_distancing , istanbul governor ali Yerlikaya said authorities had stopped people entering the area due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus . on twitter he called for patience and said the mosque would be open for prayer until saturday_morning .   " god is greatest , " chanted people in the square . some slept after arriving overnight and others ate on the grass , shaded by trees from the hot sun . some in the crowds held turkish and ottoman flags .   during his 17 - year rule , erdogan has championed islam and religious observance and backed efforts_to_restore hagia_sophia 's mosque status . he said muslims should be_able_to pray there again and raised_the_issue   popular with many pious akp - voting turks   during local elections last_year .   the conversion triggered fierce criticism from church_leaders , who said the change to exclusively muslim worship risked deepening religious divisions . turkey says the site will remain_open for visitors and its christian artworks protected .   erdogan has reshaped turkey 's modern republic , established nearly a century_ago by the
exclusive : the quiet extermination of labor rights from human_rights exclusive : the quiet extermination of labor rights from human_rights   by mark ames : progressive intellectuals have been acting very bipolar towards labor lately , characterized_by wild mood swings ranging_from the " we 're sorry we abandoned labor , how could we ! " sentiment during last_year 's wisconsin uprising against koch waterboy scott walker , to the recent " labor is dead / it 's all labor 's fault " snarling after the recall vote against gov. walker failed .   it must be confusing and a bit daunting for those deep_inside the labor movement , all these progressive mood swings . at the beginning_of_this_month , new_york_times ' columnist joe Nocera wrote a column about having a   over the abandonment of labor_unions , an abandonment that was so thorough and so complete that establishment liberals like Nocera forgot they 'd ever abandoned labor in the first place !   the intellectual - left 's wild mood swings between unrequited love towards labor_unions , and unrequited contempt , got me wondering_how this abandonment of labor has manifested_itself . while progressives and labor are arguing , sometimes viciously , over labor 's current sorry state , one thing progressives have n't done is serious self - examination on how and where this abandonment of labor manifests_itself , how it affects the very genetic makeup of liberal assumptions and major premises .   so i did a simple check : i went to the websites of three of the biggest_names in liberal activist politics : amnesty_international , human_rights_watch , and the aclu . checking their websites , i was surprised to find that not one of those three organizations lists labor as a major topic or issue that it covers .   . on the right side , under " human_rights information " you 'll_see a pull - down menu : " by topic . " does labor count as a " human_rights topic " in amnesty 's world ? i counted 27 " topics " listed by amnesty_international , including " abolish the death_penalty " , " indigenous_peoples " , " " children and human_rights " and so on . nowhere do they have " labor_unions " despite the brutal , violent experience of labor_unions both here and around the world . it 's not that amnesty 's range is n't broad : for example , among the 27 topics there are " women 's rights " , " stop violence_against_women " and " sexual_orientation and gender_identity " . there 's even a topic for " business and human_rights"but nothing for labor .   puzzled , i called alex edwards , amnesty 's media relations guy in washington_dc , to ask him why labor_unions did_n't rate important enough as a " topic

( source : twitter / narendramodi / file )   few of india 's external partnerships draw the kind of passion that iran does in delhi . india 's iran romance endures despite the huge_gap_between the hype and reality in ties . the persistent enthusiasm for iran in delhi also stands_in_stark_contrast to the perennial under - appreciation of india 's much_deeper and wider relationship with iran 's arab neighbours .   the theory of the case in delhi for an extra - special relationship with iran rests on a number of claims   historical connections , civilisational bonds , energy_supplies and regional_security . all these factors are of far greater import in india 's engagement with the arabian_peninsula . millions of indian immigrants in the arab_nations , massive hard_currency remittances from them , and the density of commercial engagement with the arab_gulf outweigh the relationship with iran . the uae and saudi_arabia have , in recent_years , extended invaluable support in countering_terrorism and blocked attempts to condemn india in the muslim world .   the sources of this curious inversion in india 's intellectual imagination are many . but first to the latest anxiety in delhi about the loss of a railway contract in iran . large countries with major foreign investments and projects win some and lose some . that is part of doing_business in other countries . then there_is_no escaping the political risk associated with foreign projects . and politics   both_domestic_and_international   is all - consuming in iran .   the chabahar_project is important for india 's regional goals , and for its relations_with_iran   the sanctions_regime imposed by the us has crippled the iranian economy . it also targets third countries that do business with certain iranian entities . india is careful not to attract the us sanctions . india did gain an exemption from the us sanctions_regime for its participation in the chabahar_port_project in iran . but they do_n't apply to some of the partners suggested by iran in the railway_project . iran would like india to break the us sanctions_regime . a prudent delhi is resisting that temptation . it would rather lose the railway contract than get into the raging crossfire_between the us and iran .   sections of the foreign_policy elite , however , see india 's iran policy as a continuous purity test for delhi 's " strategic_autonomy " . they expect delhi to conduct its

" despite india 's concern , bangladesh has given the contract of building an airport_terminal in sylhet to a chinese company . indian_high_commissioner riva_ganguly_das tried for four_months to get an appointment with the prime_minister of bangladesh but did_not get it . bangladesh has not even sent a note of appreciation to india in response to indian assistance for the covid-19 pandemic " , said the newspaper 's editor shyamal dutta in an article on the recent tilt of dhaka towards pakistan and china .   beijing urban construction group ( BUCG ) has received the contract for building a new terminal in mag Osmania airport of sylhet that borders india 's northeastern_region and is , therefore , considered a sensitive area for new_delhi .   a diplomatic_source from the bangladesh high_commission here has confirmed that the indian_envoy had sought an appointment with ms hasina but it did_not_materialise . however , neither india 's high_commission_in_dhaka nor the ministry_of_external_affairs(mea ) responded to questions from   . a diplomat from the indian mission said ms ganguly das has gone out of dhaka on a tour .   ms. hasina received_a_phone_call_from prime_minister_imran_khan of pakistan on wednesday . though dhaka refused_to_give more details of the conversation , pakistan 's official news_agency_reported that mr. khan informed ms hasina about the situation in kashmir and sought " resolution " of the dispute . india , in response on thursday , appreciated bangladesh saying that dhaka considers kashmir an_internal_matter_of_india .   ms ganguly das has_been_appointed_as the next secretary in charge of the eastern hemisphere in the mea and she is expected to take her new post in the coming_days . she was met by foreign_minister dr. a k abdul_momen on july 14 for a farewell meeting .   said that a section of ms hasina 's office is actively_supporting stronger_ties_with china . this angle was visible in the rapid improvement in ties_with_china 's ally pakistan in the last 10 months . bangladesh opted for pakistan 's onion supplies in november_2019 after india imposed_a_ban_on its export .   this was the first time that bangladesh imported agriculture items from pakistan in the last 15 years . dhaka - islamabad ties went cold after ms hasina 's government hanged jamaat_e_islami bangladesh leader Motiur rahman nizami for the 1971_war crimes in 2016 . pakistan had angrily protested_against the execution and for two years ( 2018-'19 ) dhaka did_not host

china gdp : growth drivers challenge rebalancing toward consumers daniel moss is_a_bloomberg_opinion_columnist covering asian_economies . previously he was executive_editor of bloomberg_news for global economics , and has led teams in asia , europe_and_north_america .   for all the talk_about the pandemic producing a new normal , china 's economic picture surelooks a lot like the past . exports and industrial_production are moving_ahead , and the government has big plans for infrastructure_spending . shoppers have taken_a_back_seat , constrained by social_distancing and job_losses . not so long_ago , consumers were   of a rebalancedeconomy , whichgrew to become the world 's second_largest . relying on shipments abroad , factoriesand massive public works was considered passe .   this tilt backwardis borne out in the data . on thursday , china reported   gross_domestic_product increased 3.2 %   from a year earlier . that 's better_than forecast and a big improvement from the 6.8 % decline during the first three_months of the year .   yet the bright_spots carry their_own complications . industrial_production climbed 4.8 % in june and has recovered to pre - virus levels . retail_sales , the weakest_link in the rebound , disappointed again , sliding 1.8 % instead of the anticipated increase . meanwhile , aseparate report tuesday showed both   ; the trade_surplus shrank .   this mix is understandable , but it 's not where beijing wants to be . through the past_decade , no communique from the international_monetary_fund , g-20 or any multilateral organization was complete without references to the need to reposition china 's economy . investment in the mainland by western manufacturers , relatively_cheap exports , factory job_losses in the u.s. and a managed currency created political headaches .   for its part , china hasbeen moving_away_from low - end production , where it was nolonger overwhelmingly competitive . an expanding middle_class could increasingly afford what was made at home and became anattractive lurefor consumer icons like starbucks corp. and hollywood studios . the shift suited everybody .   suffice_it_to_say , beijing has n't ditched rebalancing as a policy objective . rather , circumstances have conspired against it . further strides in containing covid-19 or the arrival of a vaccine might the consumer economy return in full vigor . that would be welcome , given china powered a third of global consumptiongrowth from 2010 to 2017 , according to the mckinsey_global_institute .   until then , relyingon factories and exports is a precarious place to be . ultimately , other countries must have sufficient demand to keep buying china 's stuff . a slow and uneven global recovery makes this a dicey proposition even more so , given the economic competition between_washington_and_beijing .   how to navigate the most difficult thanksgiving   the u.s. should n't let itself be left_behind on

hong_kong police_detain protesters , journalists , politicians hong_kong police_detain protesters , journalists , and politicians , deny claims of excessive_force   hong_kong riot_police on tuesday_evening dispersed a protest marking the first_anniversary of the yuen long railway_station attack , a major event in the 2019 protests locally_known_as the " 721 incident . "   police searched out and fined both demonstrators and journalists_covering the event , along with two politicians , kwai Tsing district councilor Rayman chow and democratic_party lawmaker ted hui . the police denied claims they used excessive_force , including pepper balls .   the demonstrators reportedly favored black clothing , an inversion of the white shirts worn by the swarm of club - wielding men who attacked pro - democracy protesters , journalists , and innocent bystanders at the yuen long station on july_21 , 2019 .   critics of the hong_kong government say beijing may have ordered the assault , using hired gangsters as muscle and apparently indulged by the hong_kong police , who responded very slowly to the bloody rampage at yuen long and have not vigorously investigated the organizers of the attack .   a few provocative local_media_reports fueled public_anger with the police as the yuen long anniversary approached . a   prompted the authorities to grudgingly admit they were aware of the white - shirted , club - wielding thugs assembling before they swarmed into the station and started_beating people . further , a separate piece in the pro - democracy newspaper   claimed internal_documents show the police were ordered not to respond to calls for help from yuen long on the day of the attack .   to date , police have charged only seven people with " rioting " and " conspiracy to injure others " for the 721 incident , even_though over a hundred white - shirted men participated in the beatings . a number of attackers caught on video or photographed by onlookers conspicuously remain unarrested , including one   ( rthk ) reported that " dozens of protesters " assembled at the yoho shopping_mall near the infamous railroad station and chanted " slogans insulting the police , calling on the force to disband , and advocating hong_kong independence . "   the demonstrators were first met by mall security_guards holding signs that cited the government ban_on_gatherings of more_than four people during the coronavirus emergency . riot_police soon took over , ran identity checks on many of the demonstrators , and dispersed the crowd .   " many shops then pulled down their shutters , as officers marched_through the mall warning people that they may be taking part in an illegal assembly , and that anyone in a group of more_than four people are in breach of the gathering ban , " rthk reported .   among those
imf wo_n't_stop china from turning pakistan into the next sri_lanka a $_6_billion_loan approved from the international_monetary_fund this week will ease pakistan 's debt problems , for now . but it wo_n't_stop china from turning the country into the next sri_lanka .   china has been very close to pakistan in recent_years , for a couple of reasons . one of them is that pakistan is a " natural " ally in beijing 's long - time efforts_to_contain india .   the other reason is that pakistan offers a " natural corridor " between western china and the indian_ocean , and , therefore , an_alternative_route to middle_east oil_supplies and the riches of africa .   that 's why beijing has been helping pakistan build the china_pakistan_economic_corridor ( cpec ) , which stretches from western china to the indian_ocean .   while cpec benefits china , this project benefits pakistan too . it 's a big leap_forward , as the country strives to transition fromanemerging to a mature economy , creating a lot of jobs in the process .   but china 's involvement in the project hurts pakistan , too . it addsto pakistan 's corruption , since it involves state_owned_companies on both_sides of the partnership .   meanwhile , corruption keeps pushing the costs of the project higher by the day .   as of 2019 , the cost of cpec_projects is $_62_billion , up from the original value of $_46_billion back in 2014 .   and that makes pakistan more indebted to china , which has been financing the project . in fact , pakistan 's external_debt took off shortly_after cpec was launched .   growing indebtedness comes_at_a_time_when the countryisalready living beyond its means , as evidenced_by persistent current_account_deficits , government debt , and external_debt   pakistan vs sri_lanka key economic metrics   |             country / metric |          pakistan |             sri_lanka |   |                        gdp |          $ 312.57B |        $ 88.90 billion |   |          gdp annual_growth |              5.2 % |                 3.70 % |   |     current_account to gdp |

in fy20 : govt gets over $ 13b in foreign loans new loans contracted to pay $ 10b maturing debt and cushion reserves   pakistan has planned to seek $_15_billion in gross foreign loans in new fiscal_year_2020 - 21 . photo : reuters   the pakistan tehreek - e - insaf ( pti ) government took over $_13_billion in foreign loans in the previous_fiscal_year - the second_highest amount in history - to repay maturing external_debt and cushion the shrinking foreign_exchange_reserves .   during fiscal_year_2019 - 20 that ended on june_30 , the country received $ 13.2 billion_worth of gross loans from bilateral_and_multilateral lenders including the international_monetary_fund ( imf ) and commercial creditors , according_to_data_compiled_by the ministry_of_economic_affairs .   with the fresh borrowing , pakistan has received a whopping_$ 29.2 billion in foreign loans in the past_two_years , including $ 26.2 billion by the government of prime_minister_imran_khan since august 2018 .   out of the $ 29.2 billion , $ 19.2 billion was used to repay the maturing external_debt and the remaining balance was added to the external public and publicly guaranteed_debt .   since repayments have been made by contracting new foreign loans , it has increased the cost of debt_servicing . for fiscal_year_2020 - 21 , the external_debt_servicing cost has been estimated at Rs315 billion despite over $_300_million or about rs50_billion worth of temporary relief due to the g20 group 's moratorium on debt_servicing .   in fiscal_year_2018 - 19 , pakistan had borrowed $_16_billion , including balance_of_payments support from gulf_countries , and returned $ 9.1 billion_worth of loans . in fiscal_year_2019 - 20 , the gross foreign loans stood_at_$ 13.2 billion and repayments amounted to slightly above $_10_billion , according to sources in the ministry_of_finance .   pakistan does_not_have_any option but to borrow to repay maturing loans and stabilise foreign_currency_reserves that had dipped below $_10_billion in may after the outflow of hot_foreign_money of over $_3_billion .   the withdrawal of hot_foreign_money , on the one hand , exposed the ill - planning of the state_bank_of_pakistan ( sbp ) and on the other highlighted the fragility of foreign_exchange_reserves that were built on the back of foreign borrowing .   the dip in foreign_exchange_reserves triggered_panic borrowing by the economic_affairs_ministry and the finance_ministry in june , according to government sources .   the government borrowing from the commercial , bilateral_and_multilateral creditors exceeded the budgetary target due to the dip in sbp 's foreign_currency_reserves , low inflows under the saudi_oil_facility and the decision not to float eurobonds valuing at $_3_billion .   the pti_government , like its predecessor , has also been unable to fully capitalise on non - debt creating inflows like exports , remittances and foreign_direct_investment .   bilateral_creditors disbursed $ 629 million in the last fiscal_year against the budgetary target of $ 480 million . the
report : chinese boats fishing in north_korean waters despite ban report : chinese ' dark fleet ' boats fishing in north_korean waters despite sanctions ban   chinese " dark fleets " have been fishing in north_korean waters in violation of united_nations sanctions , earning the Hermit kingdom millions_of_dollars in illicit fees , maritime experts   in several reports , including one   journal on wednesday , over a dozen researchers from various maritime and fisheries groups used a system of artificial_intelligence to track so - called " dark fleets , " a term for boats that can avoid public monitoring_systems .   global fishing watch said in a statement these fleets are suspected of repeatedly fishing in north_korean waters from 2017 to 2019 , catching nearly_half a billion_dollars worth of fish , around as much as the total catch by south_korean and japanese fishermen combined .   " hundreds of large , industrial vessels originating_from_china likely violated united_nations ( u.n. ) sanctions and caught almost_half a billion_dollars worth of pacific flying squid , " the group said in a statement . although north_korea would not directly receive that money , it would take a sizeable chunk through the selling of fishing rights , providing the regime with an additionalestimated $_120_million in 2018 alone .   according to researchers , at least900 such ships were observed in 2017 and over 700 were tracked in 2018 and 2019 respectively . china has denied accusations that the boats are sailing out on their orders , claiming that sophisticatedevasion tactics used by ships made it very hard to catch those involved in illegal fishing .   the presence of large chinese vessels has pushed north_korean fishermen out of the country 's territorial_waters , forcing them to travel further_afield in order to make significant catches . this has led to many ships crossing into russian waters , leading to legal clashes with russian authorities .   the reportwarned thatNorth korean fishermen risked " starvation and death " in embarking on such voyages , pointing_out_that their wooden vessels were " severely under - equipped for the long - distance travel . "   last_year , reportsalso asserted that japanese authorities had   300 north_korean boats attempting to poach squid from within their territorial_waters . eventually , coast_guard officials deployed patrol_boats armed with water_cannons after many ignored their warnings .   china , which remains north_korea 's closest_ally , has long shown a blatant_disregard for international sanctions against kim_jong - un 's stalinist dictatorship . chinese ships have also regularly been caught   coal from north_korea , providing another source_of_income for pyongyang .   both china and russia have also repeatedly   the u.n. security_council to lift_sanctions against the regime , imposed in response to the country 's nuclear_weapons_program . the measures represent

china plans to control pak 's politics and economy through cpec xi_jinping plans to rule the majority of emerging_market_economies by_2050 , which mainly includes pakistan through the cpec program .   we have all heard a lot about the cpec , which is the china - pakistan economic_corridor . this is a compilation of infrastructure_projects under construction across pakistan after 2013 .   the authority of the cpec has the constitutional power to initiate any investigation or even impose_sanctions on any public_office_holder which_includes the prime_minister and the president of pakistan . xi_jinping , chinese president , is trying to attack countries in debt_traps when they are already_suffering_from severe balance_of_payments crises .   the whole story : imran_khan must pay to support china   imran_khan 's " naya_pakistan " fulfills the dreams of chinese_president_xi_jinping at the expense of government , national righteousness and the freedom of the " pakistani awaam " .   china plans to control pakistan 's politics and economy through the cpec .   over the years , china has made many unsuccessful attempts to take ultimate control of pakistan 's economic and political affairs , but it looks_like it will succeed .   prime_minister_imran_khan is a puppet of the military institution , isi , and manipulates law_and_order to satisfy jinping 's desire to control pakistan 's ministry of planning .   the nawaz_sharif government was more capable than imran_khan ! they rejected the proposal !   after 2016 , jinping launched for the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) and a cpec_authority to do the country 's infrastructure and power_generation_projects under its direct authority .   however , the nawaz_sharif government rejected the proposal , khan ultimately accepted it .   when_asked_about the characteristics of the agreement , the author said the secretary of naval affairs refused to expose the highly confidential_agreement , even to the standing senate_committee on finance .   however , we are all aware of jinping 's plans to have ultimate control of the majority of emerging_market_economies by_2050 and we_do_not_want the belt_and_road_initiative or its segments to be_held_responsible for the resistance .   xi_jinping moves_forward to control emerging_market_economies by_2050   if the peoples of the countries affected by the belt_and_road_initiative ( bri ) learn about jinping 's strategies , his chinese dream of indoctrination of the independent peoples of the world by_2050 will not come_true .   the authority of the cpec will include authorized representatives of the chinese_communist_party in pakistan and will be responsible_for_carrying_out all activities related to the cpec .   the cpec will be the constitutional power to initiate an investigation and can impose_fines on any public_office_holder that includes the president and prime_minister of pakistan .   china will slowly poison pakistan and weak_economies !   the prime_minister 's powers will be

"   on june_15 , as university of british_columbia professor paul evans pondered this question , chinese and indian_soldiers were killing each_other in a border_clash that will do lasting_damage to the bilateral_relationship between_the_two_asian_giants .   on june_30,hong_kong   passed a new security law   that empowers beijing to potentially arrest and detain anyone anywhere that it accuses of engaging in acts of subversion against the central government , promoting the secession of chinese territories , or colluding_with foreign forces .   the two disparate events add layers to evans ' basic question .   today , xi_jinping , in his eighth year as china 's president and seeking to expand his government 's global_influence , has loaded all discussions on friendship with beijing with complicated conditions and fine_print .   what are the costs_and_benefits of friendship with an easily offended china ? who would want to be a friend of china today ? can countries live without china 's friendship ? do they have a choice not to be friends with china ?   if the chinese government is not a friend , what is that relationship ? can bilateral_ties with the world 's second - largest_economy be reduced strictly to trade_and_investment , minus the warmth of friendship ?   the canada - china friendship society of ottawa ( CCFS )   , evans , an international_relations expert in vancouver , referenced the concepts of friendship with china according to the renowned american_scholar john k Fairbank , a former canadian prime_minister , pierre trudeau , and a former australian prime_minister , kevin rudd . the three men , among others , contributed to the western world 's engagement with china over the past_seven_decades .   in evans ' description , Fairbank was a hardnosed china historian who " never considered himself a friend of china , either in its nationalist or communist period . " " as a scholar he valued detachment and often described how the chinese_communist_party used outsiders for internal political_purposes , " he said .   that detachment was crucial , as Fairbank was a pioneer in the 1950s in advocating that the us and the newly_independent china under the chinese_communist_party ( ccp ) find_ways to live with each_other .   us_president_donald_trump and chinese_president_xi_jinping in beijing in 2016 . photo : afp   still , his efforts were n't enough to prevent him from being caught up in senator joseph mccarthy 's notorious witchhunt to " flush_out " america 's

amnesty condemns enforced eviction of indigenous Chepang families by Chitwan national_park authority the rights organisation has called on the authorities_concerned to hold the people accountable who set fire and razed down the huts of the landless families .   published at : july_21 , 2020   updated at : july_21 , 2020 16:06   amnesty_international nepal has condemned the forcible eviction of the indigenous Chepang families from their settlement by the Chitwan national_park authority on saturday .   the human_rights group has also asked the authorities_concerned to stop enforced eviction of indigenous Chepang people from their settlements and ensure those involved in destroying their houses are held_accountable .   on saturday , workers from the Chitwan national_park   set two houses ablaze and destroyed eight others   using elephants with the intention of evicting the Chepang families who have been living in Kusumkhola , an area that falls under the park 's territory . ten families were rendered_homeless in the incident . they also lost their identity_documents , money and other possessions in the incident .   the park 's move to evict the landless Chepang families by means of arson and vandalism , especially when the country is dealing_with the coronavirus_pandemic and the monsoon - related_disasters , has drawn widespread_criticism .   this is the second attack on the indigenous people perpetrated in the span of two months . in june , according to amnesty , the Bardiya national_park authority had attempted to forcibly evict members of the landless Tharu community from their settlements .   " forcing anyone from their_homes is an act of cruelty . to do so with the use of arson and charging elephants , risking_lives and destroying the few possessions of an already marginalised_community , is unconscionable and a human_rights_violation , " said Nirajan Thapaliya , director of amnesty_international nepal . " the Chepang community must_be_protected . any further attempts to force them out of their_homes must_be_stopped . the people who have been forcibly evicted must be given effective_remedy , including adequate alternative housing and compensation . furthermore , the perpetrators responsible for these forced evictions should_be_held_accountable for their actions . "   the members of the Chepang community who lost_their_homes are now in temporary_accommodation in a school hostel nearby , and fear that other members of their community living near the Chitwan national_park could also suffer the same_fate , said the human_rights organisation in the statement .   " no one should be subjected to forced evictions . it is appalling that during a pandemic and ongoing rainy_season , when having a home is critical to keeping oneself safe , nepal 's authorities have chosen to dispossess some of the most marginalised people and make them homeless .

want to buy a parrot ? please login via facebook . get all our stories delivered   in bangladesh , there_is_no amazon . there_is_no ebay . if_you_want to buy a dress or a crested finch from the comfort of your home , you have to use facebook .   n april 2020 , in the midst of an ongoing national lockdown , ahmed imran kabir decided to buy a parrot .   after most of the management classes kabir taught at a university in dhaka were canceled or moved online , he suddenly had plenty of time to focus on his passion project : becoming a part - time bird breeder . sitting in his three - bedroom_apartment one day , kabir keyed in the phrase " buy - sell birds dhaka " on facebook and joined about half_a_dozen groups dedicated to avian retail .   " breeding pair . age : 20 days . contact by phone or inbox " read one post , alongside images of a pair of grayish - brown cockatiels . another seller , located in the Kallyanpur neighborhood in dhaka , posted_pictures of yellow - feathered lutino cockatiels , with the bengali phrase   which loosely translates as " to change hands . " the wording was intended to circumvent a facebook algorithm that , to prevent wildlife trafficking , automatically takes down posts with " buy " or " sell " in the description . if an interested buyer did contact an owner , the next_step was to haggle over the price of the bird on facebook_messenger .   kabir bought his first pair of birds from the 3,000 - person facebook group   " a.s. Cockatiel changes hands . " for that purchase , the seller delivered the birds in person to collect them , and kabir paid in cash . he was so pleased with his decision that he bought 24 more pairs over the next_two_weeks , including breeds such as Gouldian finches , Bengalese finches , and crested Bengalese finches . each pair cost anywhere between $ 15 and $ 60 , depending_upon the breed and its age . " at one point , i started running_out_of_space to accommodate all the birds , and sent about half_a_dozen Bengalese finches , along with some Gouldians , to my fiancee 's place , " he recalled . finally , he gave in and bought a large birdcage .   from discovery to delivery , this whole process happened on facebook .   kabir 's story is reflective of how the majority of e - commerce now happens in bangladesh . in the absence of giant online marketplaces like amazon , thousands of bespoke facebook_pages and groups have been created to meet customer demand for ornaments , apparel , cosmetics , mobile_accessories , and

king who built Gangai Konda Cholapuram temple rajendra chola   king who built Gangai Konda Cholapuram temple   Gangai Konda Cholan   Kadaram Kondan ( Kadaram is present day kedah in malaysia ) alias rajendra Cholan . who is rajendra Cholan ! ?   a forgotten chola king , the only son of the great raja raja Cholan who built the Tanjore peru udayar temple commonly_called the big temple or shri Brihadeeshwara temple .   no other ancient king of bharat comes anywhere near this Gangai Konda Cholan . certain historians especially from the northern part of the india deny the fact that this Gangai Konda Cholan victoriously marched up to assam . instead a false_claim that with prior_permission from the respective kings ruling territories on this path Gangaikondan travelled on a pilgrimage . nothing can be more insulting to this great king .   king rajendra Cholan ascended to the throne when he was in his middle - age , after the natural death of his father king raja raja . i use the word natural because this was the practice followed by our ancient indian kings . compare this with the islamic wars for succession that we have read in our history_books which only revealed a tip of the barbaric acts committed by the islamic invaders not only in india but all_over_the_world .   a tree without its roots and the human_race which has forgotten its history can not prosper nor survive .   king rajendra chola was born in the tamil month Aadi on Tiruvadirai day . Aadi is from july_15 to august_15 . his star birthday was on 19th_july this year . the day passed with no pomp , not even the ringing of the bells of the gangaikonda cholapuram temple that he built on the other side of the bank of Cauvery . the Tanjore big temple is on the other side .   the torch bearers of the dravidian and tamilian pride and self - proclaimed tamil activists i very much doubt if they are aware of this great day . this greatest king of bharat has been forgotten but his contribution to our hindu cultural and architectural heritage , admirable and unmatched military cum naval accomplishments will stand for eternity .   he excelled his father the great raja raja in all fields .   military accomplishments defeating the Gangas , Chalukyas , Rashtrakutaas , Kalingas upto assam and bengal was a no mean achievement given the rough_terrain and the huge rivers & mountains he had to cross with his huge army . the glorious march was adorned_with the defeated kings carrying the waters of the holy ganges on their head for the consecration of the Gangai Konda Cholapuram temple that he built . this is why he earned the title "
cpec 2.0 : full_speed_ahead a host of geopolitical developments could breathe new life into the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) that was perceived to be running out of steam since the pti_government took power in 2018 .   covid-19 has caused outages worldwide this year , but cpec - related_activities seemed redundant even_before_the_pandemic_hit .   cpec 2.0 : the promise and the risk   cpec observers see the launch of two ongoing hydropower_projects in azad_kashmir and a special_economic_zone ( sez ) in faisalabad this month as early_signs of renewing the multi - billion_dollar program . to remove_roadblocks and ensure_timely progress , the government is also working on the KCCP authority bill 2020 which will further_strengthen the dedicated authority established last_year .   regional resettlements and changing_dynamics in the middle_east , west and south_asia may work in pakistan 's favor . the oil shock and the greatest realization in the arab_world of a common future seems to be bringing hostile nations closer as well . iran under us sanctions has moved_closer to china vis-.-vis india for not being underestimated by an aggressive us stance . the peace_process_in_afghanistan is progressing despite minor setbacks . pandemic and border_tensions_with_china have compromised india 's ability to irritate pakistan . all of these developments are said to be conducive to cpec progress .   earlier , pti executives dismissed the perception of chinese hesitation , insisting it has been fueled by its political_opponents and forces hostile to pakistan . chinese_diplomats in pakistan reiterated their official commitment to the belt_and_road_initiative , of which cpec is a key_component .   independent experts reveal assumption that chinese prefer a separate political_party in pakistan unfounded   there may have been some gloves here and there , but extensively the work in the first_phase progressed smoothly . the emergence of pml - n or the entry of pti into islamabad has not affected it . the first_phase aimed to close the logistical and energy gaps in pakistan that blocked development efforts . many first_phase projects_have_been_completed and the rest are in various_stages of development .   graduation in the second_phase may not be fast , but the interaction between the two parties began in 2019 . it included the industrial , commercial and social development sectors , including a greater participation of the private_sector and civil_society_organizations , such as in pakistan as_well_as in china . the second stage may be less capital , but it is definitely more complex . in addition , imf and fatf issues consumed the attention of pti governments in 2018 - 19 , and the health_emergency destroyed its energy and resources in the first_half_of_2020 . we were not yet on the course of cpec , a senior_official associated with cpec shared views on the state of anonymity .   independent experts acknowledged that china reacted to
the ceo moment : leadership for a new era challenged by the global_pandemic , ceos have made four shifts in the way they lead that hold great promise for both companies and society . will they build on this unique moment , or return to the ways of the past ?   a massive humanitarian challenge : millions ill and hundreds_of_thousands of lives_lost ; soaring_unemployment rates in the world 's most robust economies ; food banks stretched beyond capacity ; governments straining to deliver critical services . the pandemic is also a challenge for businessesand their CEOsunlike any they have ever faced , forcing an_abrupt dislocation of how employees work , how customers behave , how supply_chains function , and even what ultimately constitutes business performance .   confronting this unique moment , ceos have shifted how they lead in expedient and ingenious ways . the changes may have been birthed of necessity , but they have great_potential beyond this crisis . in this article , we explore four shifts in how ceos are leading that are also better ways to lead a company : unlocking bolder ( " 10x " ) aspirations , elevating their " to be " list to the same level as " to do " in their operating models , fully embracing stakeholder capitalism , and harnessing the full power of their ceo peer networks . if they become permanent , these shifts hold the potential to thoroughly recalibrate the organization and how it operates , the company 's performance potential , and its relationship to critical constituents .   only ceos can decide_whether to continue leading in these new ways , and in so doing seize a once - in - a - generation opportunity to consciously evolve the very nature and impact of their role . indeed , as we have written   , part of the role of the ceo is to serve as a chief calibratordeciding the extent and degree of change needed . as part of this , ceos must have a thesis of transformation that works in their company context . a good ceo is always scanning for signals and helping the or
11 sezs to be established under cpec : ahsan islamabad : minister_for_planning , development and reforms ahsan_iqbal on monday said that nine special_economic_zones ( sezs ) would be established in the four provinces , gilgit - baltistan , ajk and two at federal level .   talking_to_media after_attending_a_meeting of the parliamentary_committee on china_pakistan_economic_corridor ( cpec ) , he said the panel was briefed on the proceedings of 6th joint_cooperation_committee held in beijing , including the projects included in cpec by the chinese government , which were suggested by the provinces and approved by the prime_minister .   peshawar circular_railway and gilgit - chitral to chakdara road_projects were included in the cpec on the recommendation of the khyber_pakhtunkhwa government , he added . he said noshki - Nokundi road project was also included in multi - billion_dollars deal as it suggested by the balochistan government .   ahsan said the provincial_governments were also asked to allocated land for the establishment of special_economic_zones in their_respective_provinces . the jcc also approved the installation of north - south transmission_line which would also provide electricity for peshawar and dera_ismail_khan from the national_grid , he added .   the parliamentary_committee , he said , was also apprised that the jcc accorded_approval for the development of water plant and 300 - mw_electricity plant at gwadar . the minister said work on the construction_of_diamer - bhasha_dam would start during current_financial_year with the government also allocating_funds in the next year 's public_sector_development_programme ( psdp ) .   the mega_project would_be_able_to store about 10 to 12 million_acres feet water and completed in 10 to 12 years . he said country was able to enhance electricity_generation capacity to 15,000 to 16,000 mw in last 66 years but the government was working on different power_projects to produce about 18,000 - mw_of_electricity in three years .
why the us ordered china 's houston consulate closed | july_22 , 2020 11:54 am   china 's houston consulate in response to beijing 's use of that consulate for highly aggressive espionage efforts against u.s. intellectual_property and american_citizens of chinese ancestry .   the key concern was china 's ministry_of_state_security 's use of the houston consulate as a key operations station for south - central and west_coast espionage operations . as i understand it , the houston station is connected to the indictment on tuesday of two mss officers for cyberespionage against american intellectual_property targets and coronavirus_vaccine research . the houston station was very likely used as a targeting center to gather_intelligence for cyberattack teams on the chinese_mainland .   so what has the mss been doing , specifically , out of houston ?   well , mss officers have been using the consulate as a base to receive and pursue taskings in relation to beijing 's top espionage priorities . these have included a focus on penetrating the defense and tech sectors in houston and in the so - called silicon hills area of austin . but china 's houston station has also been used to track and harass u.s. citizens who china believes   to the communist_party regime . some of this mss activity has involved very aggressive face - to - face confrontations and threats of a degree that makes even the russian_intelligence services ' activity on u.s. soil look mild . to be clear , it crosses general red_lines on the conduct of intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover .   the closure is also about ensuring that the u.s. government can more effectively constrain china 's espionage operations on u.s. soil . while u.s. diplomats and intelligence officers stationed in china are persistently monitored by a significant chinese technical and large , human surveillance effort , the same can_not_be said of chinese officers on u.s. soil . that 's because the fbi , which has responsibility for monitoring foreign intelligence officers , lacks the counterintelligence profile to monitor all spies at all times . the best the fbi can do is prioritize its efforts and deploy its agents and surveillance_teams in that vein . closing the consulate means that the fbi will have more resources to free up against other top mss stations . most_notably , those based out of the washington , d.c. , embassy and china 's consulate in san_francisco .   at present , the trump_administration is engaged in a steady effort to escalate the pressure on beijing . this includes   in the south_china_sea , justice department warnings of chinese influence campaigns , and president_trump 's return to blaming the coronavirus_pandemic on china . but with china promising to retaliate_against its consulate closure , tensions are only heading upward .

us policymakers should shift to a cooperative mind - set with china in another anti - china move , a number of us republican_lawmakers introduced comprehensive legislation aimed_at confronting their fixated strategic_competitor on multiple_fronts -from the so - called intellectual_property_theft to china 's " aggression " in the south_china_sea .   the bill , called strengthening trade , regional alliances , technology , and economic and geopolitical initiatives concerning china ( strategic ) act , was proposed on wednesday by the chairman of the us senate_foreign_relations_committee jim risch , together with others . senator mitt_romney , who co - authored the bill , addressed china 's " growing aggression " and " predatory efforts , " and risch hoped the legislation " provides a blueprint to advance bipartisan cooperation in all aspects of the competition with china in 2020 and beyond . "   at_a_time_when china - us relations have entered their most intense dynamics , the us ' china policy is still dictated_by those who blindly adopt an anti - china stance and who lack adequate knowledge of china . such a lack_of_understanding is reflected by their views of china through an exceedingly ideological and geopolitical lens .   they misjudged china 's development as the country 's strategic ambition to surpass the us and dominate the world , and mistakenly believe china adopts a winner - take - all approach like what the us has_always_been engaging in . as_a_result , their china policy is partial , flippant and petty , and lacks a strategic_vision .   the origin of the current frayed china - us relationship is the us fear toward china 's fast development and us anxiety over its_own decline . amid such fear_and_anxiety , the us imagines china as a vicious enemy , and this mentality went out of control as the covid-19 epidemic raged across the us .   " competition " dominates the drafting of the latest us bill . although competitors can still be partners and do_not_necessarily become adversaries , the us discourse has gone even further to make china and the us enemies .   now , rationality in the minds of those us republican_senators has been marginalized . competition - driven , sensational and extreme china policies have gone rampant among the us policymaking circle . this not only has something to do with the backdrop of china - us tense_relations , but also is a result of the upcoming presidential_election . hyping the " china threat " could just be what the republicans_and_democrats have in common , and where the republicans can save their slumping votes .   us political_elites are now indulged in their tough_stance toward china without_having_any real knowledge and judgment of what china 's development means to the us . they are dealing_with china - us relations with a simple

from the united_states to china , every country should respect national_sovereignty countries should mind their_own business ...   two cheers for a classic idea that 's been out of fashion for too long : state sovereignty .   us_president_donald_trump attends the un climate_action summit on sept. 23 , 2019 at the united_nations Headquaters in new_york_city .   johannes EISELE / afp_via_getty_images   what 's the dumbest idea affecting the foreign_policy of major_powers ? there_are_plenty of candidatesthe domino theory ; the myth of the short , cheap war ; the belief that a particular deity is " on the side " of one nation and will guarantee its success ; etc . but right up there with those worthy contenders is a country 's belief that it has found the magic formula for political , economic , social , and international success and that it has the right , the responsibility , and the ability to spread this gospel far_and_wide .   in some cases , this impulse arises from ( mostly ) benevolent aims : the leaders of some country genuinely believe that spreading ( through force , if necessary ) their ideals and institutions to others will genuinely benefit the recipients . defensive motives may also be operating : a state may believe that it can_not_be reliably secure unless other countries have similar if not identical institutions . u.s. leaders once worried that america could_not_survive alone in a world dominated by fascism , and joseph_stalin believed the soviet_union needed " friendly " countries on its borders , by which he meant countries governed_by leninist parties patterned after the soviet model .   of course , such claims may simply be a reassuring story that ruling_elites propagate to justify aggressive_actions undertaken for more selfish reasons . whatever the motivation , if their efforts were successful the world would gradually converge on a single model for political , economic , and social life . individual national variations would be modest and declining in importance , limited to purely local concerns ( such as national holidays , cuisine , preferred musical styles , etc . ) . in theory , even some of these features might begin to lose their individual features over time .   this has n't happened , however , due to an intriguing paradox . thus_far , the only political form that has commanded nearly universal global acceptance is the territorial state itself , along with the closely_related idea of nationalism . as   have explored , the territorial state was only one of several political forms coexisting in early modern europe , and its eventual emergence as the dominant political form was a contentious process that might have turned out differently . many factors contributed to its ultimate success , and one of them was the idea of sovereignty

belt_and_road_project springs back to life in pakistan belt_and_road_project springs back to life in pakistan   pakistan prime_minister_imran_khan during a function in lahore , pakistan .      file / tribune news service   china 's belt_and_road programme has found new life in pakistan with $_11_billion worth of projects signed in the last_month , driven by a former lieutenant_general who has reinvigorated the infrastructure plan that 's been languishing since prime_minister_imran_khan took office two years_ago .   the nations signed_deals on june_25 and july_6 for two hydro - power_generation_projects costing_$ 3.9_billion in the disputed_kashmir_region , and another to revamp the south_asian_nation 's colonial - era railways for $_7.2_billion the most_expensive chinese project yet in pakistan .   khan 's government appointed asim_saleem_bajwa last_year to run the china - pakistan economic_corridor authority , which_oversees more_than $_70_billion in projects from power_plants to highways . he also joined khan 's cabinet in late april , becoming one of more_than_a_dozen former and current military officials in prominent government roles as the army expands its influence in the country .   the chinese financing has helped rid pakistan of an electricity deficit that left exporters unable_to_meet orders and major_cities without electricity for much of the day . still , the implementation of some investments appeared to stall since khan came to power , with no new projects announced in 2018 and very few in 2019 .   since chinese_president_xi_jinping launched the initiative in 2013 , the world_bank_estimates about $ 575 billion_worth of energy plants , railways , roads , ports and other projects have been built or are in the works across_the_globe . its progress has slowed recently , dogged by accusations that china is luring poor_countries into debt_traps for its_own political and strategic gain .   " the reality is that much of cpec , like the belt_and_road more_broadly , has been paralyzed , " said jonathan hillman , a senior_fellow_at the center_for_strategic_and_international_studies in washington , referring to the china - pakistan economic_corridor . pakistan " is a flagship for china 's belt_and_road , so the need to show progress is even more important . "   in a tweet last_month , bajwa said some_detractors had given the " false_impression " that cpec had been slowed . not only has the pace_of_work_on_projects_picked up recently , but a great_deal of ground work_has_been_done to launch_phase two of the project that also includes special_economic_zones to lure chinese manufacturers , agriculture , science , technology and tourism , he wrote .

falcon down : why pakistan is desperate to fake the f-16 dogfight falcon down : why pakistan is desperate to fake the f-16 dogfight   the february_27 downing of a pakistan air_force f-16 falcon over kashmir by wing_commander_abhinandan_varthaman is unlikely to be acknowledged by islamabad . the danger for pakistan is that the complete denial of past defeats   and the refusal to analyse these setbacks   will continue to cost its armed_forces dearly in future wars .   the pakistani military sucks at fighting   it has lost all four wars against india   but when_it_comes_to lying , it 's in a league of its_own . throughout its short history pakistan has attempted to hide its quite considerable war losses while making highly exaggerated_claims about imaginary victories notched up by its armed_forces . after decades of islamist indoctrination , the pakistani_military_establishment has become so deeply infected_with_the_virus of jehad that it will never admit losing to a ' kafir ' nation . in this backdrop , the february_27 downing of a pakistan air_force f-16 falcon over kashmir by wing_commander_abhinandan_varthaman is unlikely to be acknowledged by islamabad .   the reason_why it clings to lies and fakery is that for all its size the pakistan military machine is a paper_tiger that can not fight india for more_than a few_days . to shore_up morale   and to keep up the myth of the invincibility of the pakistani soldier against the ' kafir ' indian   the military has to present defeats as victory and at_the_same_time claim to have routed indian forces . although many pakistani military officers and media_commentators now agree that india defeated pakistan in all four wars , the gullible masses of that country remain convinced that pakistan has never been defeated .   the pakistanis know their claims will get traction in the west . because most of pakistan 's war fighting equipment is of western origin , islamabad has plenty of supporters in the west , especially in the pentagon   the us defence department   and the virulently anti - indian left_liberal media . the ingratiating behaviour of pakistan army_generals has also endeared them to westerners who back up their stories by offering ' expert ' analysis . such analysis is gamed from the start because these so - called experts are at best company men or at worst charlatans . however , they have one_thing_in_common   they work for western interests and are by no means neutral or unbiased .   the latest instance of western ' experts ' trying to bolster the pakistani narrative comes from foreign_policy_magazine which quotes two anonymous american military officials on the f-16 shooting . the magazine reports that us defence_personnel conducted a physical count of pakistan 's f-16 fleet and found none missing . the difference

indian economy will suffer due to planned sanction of chinese_firms : experts indian economy will suffer due to planned sanction of chinese_firms : experts   by yang sheng and liu Xuanzun source : global_times_published : 2020/7/21 19:23:40   indian economy and customers will suffer as new_delhi plans to sanction several chinese_companies due to their " military connection , " because india ca_n't find an ideal replacement from other countries , said chinese analysts . they said such moves only show that the indian government failed to manage domestic nationalism .   the indian government has identified at_least seven chinese_companies operating in india " with alleged direct_or_indirect links to the people 's_liberation_army ( pla ) along with chinese venture_capital investments in india , including ' big_names , ' where the benefits of civilian innovation are suspected to be used for china 's defense sector , " indian media the economic times reported on monday .   they are alibaba , tencent , huawei , Xindia steel ltd which is considered one of the largest joint_ventures_between china and india , Xinxing cathay international group which has set_up a manufacturing_facility in chhattisgarh with an investment of rs_1,000_crore ( $ 11.4 billion ) , china electronics technology group corporation ( CETC ) and SAIC motor corporation_limited .   the move came after new_delhi banned_59_chinese_apps in the country .   hu zhiyong , a research_fellow_at_the_institute of international_relations of the shanghai academy_of_social_sciences , told_the_global_times_on_tuesday that these chinese it giants are providing irreplaceable online finance services to india and making it more convenient for the indian middle_class to do business online . so if the indian government sanctions these companies , the country 's middle_class will be harmed as well .   " india does_not_want to confront china militarily , but needs to find a new way to respond to radical nationalism , as these chinese_firms have become new targets , " hu said .   military - civilian integration is a common and open commercial model around the world , and " connection to military " is only an_excuse india uses to restrict chinese_companies ' legitimate civilian business , a chinese intelligence security expert told_the_global_times_on_tuesday under condition_of_anonymity , citing us aviation giant boeing , which not only manufactures civilian aircraft , but also serves as one of the largest contractors of the us military .   although Xinxing cathay makes military vehicles and clothes , and CETC is one of the largest providers of electronic systems , including radars , to the pla , the chinese_companies ' business with the pla does_not_mean they will threaten the national_security of india , and india did_not provide evidence to support its accusations and motivation , the expert said .   when beijing moved to ease the border_tension created by india , new_delhi showed no sincerity to settle the issue

iran jolts india to activate us sanctions loophole iran jolts india to activate us sanctions loophole   tehran threatens to pass over india for china , seeking to reactivate the chabahar_port investment project   iranian_president_hassan_rouhani   inspects a guard_of_honor during a ceremonial reception at the indian presidential_palace in new_delhi on february 17 , 2018 . photo : money sharma / afp   earlier_this_month , authorities in new_delhi were rattled by reports from iran that india had been expelled from a key investment project in favor of rival china .   the prospect that india could lose its role in a rail_line project meant to connect iran 's indian_ocean port_of_chabahar to the afghan_border city of zahedan due to an apparent failure to invest raised_questions in india about the foreign priorities of the government . spurred to action , diplomats rushed to safeguard the country 's interests in the iranian southern_port , which is considered crucial for india 's regional ambitions .   with india fully complying , and some may say over - complying_with us sanctions_on_iran , above all by suspending its energy imports from iran while putting only a minimal effort in chabahar projects , it is_hardly_surprising that iran has now openly contemplated a drastic cut in india 's rights_and_privileges in iran . while tehran subsequently denied the " rumors " , they were seen as a warning .   the timing of this development , coinciding_with rising india - china border_tensions on the one hand , and news of an impending   between tehran and beijing on the other , is very_important . india can ill - afford losing ground to china , which may well happen in chabahar if iran decides it can get a much_better deal from beijing . china could conceivably extend its ambitious_belt_and_road_initiative to chabahar once the current ten - year agreement between tehran and new_delhi expires in 2026 .   already , iran 's ambassador to pakistan has raised_the_issue of connectivity between the " sister " ports of gwadar , built by china , and iran 's chabahar , considered by new_delhi as a counterpoint to china 's regional_influence .   iran prefers a more inclusive interpretation , whereby both china and india could simultaneously benefit from the chabahar_port_project . but with iran and china moving_closer to clinching the landmark long - term agreement , the future of chabahar has inevitably gained an added urgency for all parties .   a big_question is if iran can indeed play both_sides and somehow accommodate the interests of both china and india simultaneously , particularly if india continues to closely align its foreign_policy with iran 's chief rivals , the us and israel , and is embroiled in an intractable competition with china .   for the moment , the dominant thinking in iran is
end of iran - india chabahar deal : strategic_partnership between china and iran and its implications for cpec from pakistan 's perspective pakistan 's view on the world   end of iran - india chabahar deal : strategic_partnership between china and iran and its implications for cpec from pakistan 's perspective   iran and india had made an agreement to develop   back on 23rd may 2016 during the indian pm_narendra_modi visit to iran . the same was renewed when the iranian_president visited india ( 15 - 17 february 2018 ) . despite these arrangements , the project did_not materialize owing to the lack of funding from the indian side after almost 4 years . as a consequence , the deal has been scrapped altogether by the iranian government . both_sides are blaming_each_other for the delay in the project . indians have termed this scrapping of the deal as a big_loss for modi 's government .   has apparently decided to complete the project on its_own citing the absence of indian involvement in the project so_far .   iran expected that india would play_an_active_role in investments in chabahar_port by constructing a strategic railway_line from chabahar to zahedan wherein it will connect with   and up to kabul . that line will be further extended_till Sarakhas in turkmenistan . however , the threat of us sanctions and the absence of tangible action by the indian side has made iran look towards other options . iran had already stated its desire to be a part of china 's   ( obor ) strategic initiative after seeing the drawdown effects of the same in the shape of cpec in neighboring0 pakistan . one of the reasons for the bilateral hiccup was the   earlier_this_year when iranian foreign_minister javed zarif openly condemned violence against the muslim_community . secondly , india shut_down energy imports from iran after the threats of us sanctions . that adversely_affected the chabahar - zahedan rail_project . thus , iran had limited_options available and hence dropped india from the chabahar_rail_project .   india 's original_plan for the chabahar to zaranj railway   iran has kicked india out of the chabahar deal citing inordinate_delay in funding from the indian government . the surprise decision has come amid a momentous strategic_partnership between iran and china to the tune of us 400_billion dollars over a period of the next 25 years .   a 25 - year china - iranian strategic_partnership was a matter of time in the light of recent_developments . last_year , iran 's foreign_minister   paid_a_visit to his_chinese_counterpart   for a new agreement that builds upon a previous deal that was signed in 2016 .   managed touncovermany components of the agreement at the time . according to the publication 's source , iran 's petroleum_ministry confirmed
ai says men are lazy ai says men are lazy   advances in artificial_intelligence are often framed as though they 'll upend human society overnight , and for the last_month technologists have had a new darling to obsess over . it 's a piece of software called GPT-3 , which can write essays , songsand computer code in response to requests that humans type into its interface in plain text .   the program comes from OpenAI , a top artificial_intelligence research organization .

" GPT-3 says one . the answer , for any computers reading this , is zero .   this is because GPT-3 is limited by its approach , which involves mining a huge_number ofhuman writing samples to piece together compelling responses . as_a_result , there are types of questions it struggles with , usually the types of queries humans would answer easily with one eyebrow raised . GPT-3 appears_to_be better at putting together code to solve an equation than to just solving the problem itself .

in a nation of farmers , agricultural_land lies Fallow growers blame years of government corruption and inefficiency for lack of promised assistance . now , the land meant to bring economic power to black farmers instead leaves them with empty pockets .   MASHONALAND west , zimbabwe   the smell of freshly plowed soil fills the air at a kent estates farm , about 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) from harare , the capital_city . soft sounds of hoes piercing the soil echo from a distance . farmers are at work .   those farmers are Godfrey Gosa and his employees toiling on his holding of 85 hectares ( about 210 acres ) . Gosa began farming in 2004 after he became a beneficiary of zimbabwe 's fast - track land_reform program .   but today Gosa uses only 10 of those hectares , where he grows maize , beans and leafy vegetables . the rest lie idle .   the land goes unused because Gosa 's farm was once a plantation of gum trees , and he does_n't have the machinery to clear them . and he has lost_faith in government efforts to help .   " i would spend weeks with nothing materializing because corruption dominated the program , " says Gosa , referring to zimbabwe 's current setup to assist farmers , known as command agriculture . " i was really tired of that . "   in 2000 , zimbabwe announced fast - track land_reform , created to take property from its white minority and return millions of hectares to its black majority . in this nation of farmers , it was a move that promised economic relief and power to black zimbabweans , who at the time owned the country 's least valuable tracts and a fraction of the land overall .   twenty years later , many farmers believe the promise of prosperity remains_unfulfilled . vast tracts of land lie fallow because growers do_n't have equipment and " inputs , " such as seed and fertilizer . frustrated farmers like Gosa say that , among other challenges , government efforts meant to provide them with these necessities have been crippled by corruption and inefficiencies , leaving them with unproductive fields .   Juliet Chimimba washes dishes on her farm in kent estates , where she moved her family during zimbabwe 's land_reform initiative in the early_2000s . she says she uses only_a_fraction of her land because she lacks financing and machinery .   farmers remain some of the few whose industries are not decimated by a government lockdown intended_to_prevent the spread of the coronavirus   at_least not yet . " people still need to eat , " Gosa says . " in the long_run , we foresee coronavirus affecting the economy as

potential dual - use china - pakistan fiber_optic_cable comes online real - timeanalysis of events occurring at the intersection of economics , finance and global security_concerns .   potential dual - use china - pakistan fiber_optic_cable comes online   posted wednesday , july_22 , 2020 at 12:04pm   chairman , retired_lieutenant_general asim_bajwa , announced the commercial launch of a new segment of the china - pakistan fiber_optic project (   ) , a major project that , once completed , will connect china to pakistan 's strategic port cities of gwadar and karachi via the khunjerab_pass , islamabad and rawalpindi ( where the country 's army headquarters are located ) . the segment recently_launched links islamabad to the khunjerab_pass . although the contractors for this segment connection are unclear , the first_phase of the project , announced in february_2019 , which linked rawalpindi also to the khunjerab_pass over 820 kilometers , was implemented by huawei .   the next_phase of the project will extend this fiber_optic connection to karachi and gwadar and is reportedly about to commence . gwadar is being developed with significant chinese investment and is widely speculated to be serving dual - use military purposes   traverses into pakistan from china via the disputed gilgit - baltistan_region , where some   , pakistan has handed " de_facto " control to the people 's_liberation_army . china has reportedly been building dual - use tunnels and roads throughout the region since 2016 . most recently , in 2020 , china 's construction of the controversial   in gilgit - baltistan raised controversy ( particularly within india ) , for these and other reasons . the fiber_optic_cable , and the strategic cities it intends to connect , adds additional strategic_significance to the region , enhancing its importance to beijing and pakistan .   as the cable represents pakistan 's only   internet infrastructure , it has_been_touted_as a means to bring improved internet to the north ofthe country , but also as an alternative to the country 's present dependency on   internet_connections that enter primarily through the country 's southern_port cities .   1010 wisconsin avenue , suite 250
how iran - china agreement will affect cpec & regional_cooperation ? | the multi - billion - dollar economic and technical_assistance agreement between iran and china is likely to receive a lot_of_attention globally . this shows that china is now moving_towards a more active_role in the persian_gulf and the middle_east .   the new agreement between iran and china is an extension of china 's global policy of connecting different continents economically . an example of this is the belt_and_road_initiative . china is working on a rail_network for direct_access to central_asia and europe , a small_portion of which will pass through iran .   if the new agreement between iran and china is completed , it will not only make iran better connected with other countries of the world but also the projects connected with it for the socio - economic_development of iran will be very_important .   two years_ago , iran wanted to be part of the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) and for that , iran wanted to establish a modern road link between chabahar_and_gwadar . now , this contact can be established with the consent of china and pakistan .   china 's economic revolution & world power politics   thanks to this new connection , iran will have trade access to china 's xinjiang_region ( western region ) . it will also provide_an_opportunity to further_strengthen economic_ties between pakistan and iran . the steps that china and iran are going to take are an expression of the reality of world politics . the two countries ' relations with the united_states have problems for_a_variety_of_reasons . the united_states wants to keep iran in check . like iran , china has problems with its relations with the united_states .   the united_states has questioned china 's recent steps to strengthen its administrative_control over hong_kong . in addition , some islands in the south_china_sea are the reason for disputes between the united_states and china .   the agreement_reached_between the united_states , india , australia , and japan to promote_economic cooperation and stability in the asia - pacific_region is seen by china as a ploy to curb its diplomatic and economic_activities . so china wants to use iran as a stepping_stone to gain a foothold in the gulf and the middle_east .   china - iran strategic agreement & its impact on the changing_geopolitical alliances   iran is also in the process of easing us sanctions , and for that , it wants to establish strong economic_ties with its neighbors . arab_countries can_not_be helpful . turkey will maintain its economic relations_with_iran at the same level .   if the new chinese plan succeeds , iran will surely find a good way to trade , which will enable it to expand its economic_and_trade_ties to central_asia and pakistan . there are bright

" the renewed_focus_on the appropriateness of confederate_monuments in the public square has sharpened our focus to deal with these historical objects more efficiently or quickly , " said corey piper , the museum 's curator of american art . " they have moved to the head of the queue . "   the chrysler museum is among many cultural_institutions in america that are confronting the ways in which they tell early histories of the united_states with new urgency , in the wake of protests prompted by the murder_of_george_floyd . while it is uncommon that art museums own confederate memorabilia , many are reassessing artistically and historically significant objects that also reinforce pernicious narratives about slavery and colonialism . but as institutions shaped by colonial legacieswhose very amassing of objects and display methods have perpetuated racism and sexismthese reassessments are just one step_towards dismantling their pervasive cultures of white_supremacy .

pakistani_journalist hits_out_at security_agencies for abudcting matiullah_jan pakistan journalist_hamid_mir speaks on matiullah abduction_case , hints_at isi and the army facilitating intimidation of media_persons   hamid_mir ( left ) , matiullah_jan ( right )   while speaking to voice_of_america ( voa ) , pakistani_journalist hamid_mir hinted_at the role of the pakistan army and its intelligence_agency_isi in masterminding the abduction of fellow journalist_matiullah_jan. at the very onset , mir accused the inspector_general ( ig ) of deliberately not appearing_before the supreme_court of pakistan in a bid_to_avoid furnishing the cctv_footage which indicates the role of ' non - civilian authority ' in the forced_disappearance of the journalist .   " ig did_not come to court because he knew that the chief_justice will ask him to produce the footage of safe_city_cameras . in the footage , it is clearly_visible that matiullah_jan was abducted from outside a school by people who were dressed in police uniform . they had even used a police car for the operation . they wanted to give the impression that it was executed by the cops . however , the deputy_inspector_general_of_police(dig ) has refuted claims of any police involvement in the case . according to my information , the civilian government , civilian agencies or the islamabad police have no role in his abduction . "   hamid_mir informed that he was too unsure_about the role of ' non - civilian ' authority in the forced_disappearance of matiullah_jan , until segments of his show were ' censored ' by those who have been ' historically ' accused of executing such abductions . " the last segment of my show was about matiullah_jan wherein i talked with IjazShah since he was the first to retrieve the cctv_footage .   first , they edited the opening_remarks about the journalist 's disappearance . then , i learnt that more such cuts are being made to the show . and this was done on the behest of a non - civilian authority the story became crystal_clear to me the accused are those who have been involved in such_incidents even in the past . "   hamid_mir laments about declining press_freedom   he explained how the not - to - be - named agency is imposing censorship on geo_news . mir stated , " they have put mir_shakil - ur - rahman   through nab . now they use him as_a_bargaining_chip . they call up the editor - in - chief and direct them to censor inconvenient things this is the state of press_freedom in pakistan . when i was attacked , i had named 3 people who i believed was responsible for the attack . and guess what ? they never appeared_before_the_court . if you were innocent , then , you could have and argued in court .

china successfully launches first mars_mission china successfully launches first mars_mission   a mars_probe is launched on a long march-5 rocket from the Wenchang spacecraft launch site in south china 's hainan_province , july_23 , 2020 .   WENCHANG , hainan , july_23 ( xinhua ) -- china launched a mars_probe on thursday , designed to complete orbiting , landing and roving in one mission , taking the first step in its planetary exploration of the solar system .   a long march-5 rocket , china 's largest launch_vehicle , carrying the spacecraft with a mass of about 5 tonnes , soared into the sky from the Wenchang spacecraft launch site on the coast of southern china 's island province_of_hainan at 12:41 p.m. ( beijing time ) .   about 36 minutes later , the spacecraft , including an orbiter and a rover , was sent into the earth - mars transfer orbit , embarking on an almost seven - month journey to the red_planet , according to the china national space administration ( cnsa ) .   china 's first mars_mission is named tianwen-1 , which means questions to heaven and comes from a poem written by qu yuan ( about 340 - 278 bc ) , one of the greatest poets of ancient china . the name signifies the chinese nation 's perseverance in pursuing truth and science and exploring nature and the universe , said the cnsa .   " the successful_launch is only the first step of china 's mars_mission , and we hope each of the many key steps of the long_journey is completed successfully , " said geng yan , an official at the lunar exploration and space_program center of the cnsa .   the key steps include slowing_down when close to mars , orbiting , separating the landing platform and the rover from the orbiter , landing softly and roving .   the craft is expected to enter the orbit of mars around february_2021 . afterwards , it will spend two to three_months surveying potential landing sites using a high - resolution camera to prepare for the landing in may.   the most challenging part of the mission will be the soft landing , an autonomous process of the probe lasting seven to eight_minutes . the probe will use its aerodynamic shape , parachute and retrorocket to decelerate and buffer legs to touch down , said geng .   after the landing , the rover will be released to conduct scientific exploration with an expected lifespan of at_least 90 martian days ( about three_months on earth ) , and the orbiter , with a design life of one martian year ( about 687 days on earth ) , will relay communications for the rover while conducting its_own scientific detection .   chinese space
has trump driven china and iran together ? has trump driven china and iran together ?   that iran and china are pursuing a long - term , economic and security partnership have set_off_alarm bells in the trump_administration , and rightly so . according to iranian officials , the deal would vastly expand chinese_investments in banking , telecommunications ,   , railways , and dozens of other projects in exchange for tehran supplying beijing with discounted oil for the next 25 years . the   would also potentially include joint military training , exercises , counter - terrorism cooperation , intelligence_sharing , and arms_transfers to iran .   there is reason to take some of the more   with a grain_of_salt , as the document detailing the arrangement is still only a draft , the chinese government has not officially_confirmed it , and iran   though economically desperate   remains reluctant to compromise its autonomy   by selling off key industries and further increasing its dependence_on_china . the negotiations over the current strategic_partnership proposal go_back to president   xi_jinping 's visit to tehran   in 2016 , and if past pledges are anything to go by , iran will likely never see the $_400_billion in investment mentioned in the draft . still , trump officials and   are right to be seriously_concerned . even the partial implementation of a chinese - iranian strategic_partnership would signal a major_escalation in the u.s. strategic_competition with china and blow a hole in the administration 's " maximum_pressure " campaign against iran at_the_same_time . and if trump continues with his failing and flailing unilateral efforts_to_bring about   and allows the united_states to slide_into a   with china , he risks turning what is currently an aspirational chinese - iranian flirtation into a full - blown anti - american strategic_partnership .   close_ties between tehran and beijing are   nor solely a function of u.s. policy . china has long been the biggest market for iranian_oil , for many years buying   as much as 800,000 barrels_per_day   . bilateral_trade between_the_two_countries rose from almost nothing in the early_1990s to   more_than $_50_billion in 2014   . and since the 1980s , china has sold iran   such as tanks , combat_aircraft , armored personnel_carriers , and a range of surface - to - air and anti - ship cruise_missiles , including the advanced silkworms that threaten shipping in the gulf . both countries are opponents of u.s. global leadership and share an interest in limiting american influence in the middle_east .   even so , china has , until now at_least , been broadly willing to limit its cooperation with iran and support the u.s.-led international campaign to force iran to curtail its nuclear_program .

xinjiang officials condemn u.s. " sanctions " as hegemonic acts xinjiang officials condemn u.s. " sanctions " as hegemonic acts   beijing , july_21 ( xinhua ) -- four officials in china 's xinjiang_uygur_autonomous_region have strongly_condemned the so - called sanctions recently imposed by the united_states , calling them " blatant hegemonic acts . "   " xinjiang affairs are purely china 's internal_affairs , and external forces , including u.s. politicians , have no right or qualifications to make irresponsible_remarks on xinjiang or wantonly intervene , " said chen_quanguo in an_interview_with xinhua .   " the so - called sanctions by the united_states are blatant , outrageous , and unjustifiable acts of hegemony , which seriously violate international_law_and_basic_norms governing international_relations , gravely interfere in china 's internal_affairs , and severely damage china - u.s. relations , " said chen . " i strongly_condemn and firmly_oppose that . "   " what needs to be stated is that i have no interest in going to the united_states at all , nor do i have any assets there , " said chen , adding that the " sanctions " are just an ugly farce and disgusting , clumsy tricks of u.s. politicians to humiliate themselves .   chen said that , for three years and seven months in a row , no violent terrorist_incidents have occurred in xinjiang , where the living_standards of people of all ethnic_groups have continuously improved , absolute_poverty will be eliminated , and people of all ethnic_groups live in peace and contentment , and enjoy their full rights to subsistence and development .   " no force can interfere with or stop the stability , development , and prosperity of xinjiang and the solidarity of people of all ethnic_groups in the region to march forward . i_am full of confidence in a brighter_future of xinjiang , " chen said .   zhu Hailun said it is an old_trick by the united_states to interfere in internal_affairs_of_other_countries and contain their development under_the_guise of " human_rights . " its ultimate purpose is to serve its_own selfish interests .   " what the united_states did is ridiculous and laughable , " said wang Mingshan . " the poor performances of the united_states in attacking , smearing , and rumor - mongering over xinjiang - related affairs will only make the world understand more clearly the hypocrisy and hegemony of the united_states . "   " the united_states is the world 's biggest human_rights violator . its groundless_accusations against xinjiang are the biggest lies of the century , " said Huo Liujun . enditem
trump and the art of 5_g war the effectiveness of the american countercharge is built on 5 pillars : clean communication , collaboration , washington 's investment in the success of non - chinese telecom_companies and not just governments , igniting investor interest in do - ability and not punishing legacy networks who got wedded to huawei and gang in a more innocent world .   the killing fields of 5_g are no_longer emperor xi_jinping 's exclusive preserve . never mind trump 's botch - ups on the coronavirus front , as far as 5_g is concerned , xi stands thumped with some very smart cyber diplomacy .   the effectiveness of the american countercharge has five_pillars : clean communication ; collaboration ; washington 's investment in the success of non - chinese telecom firms ; igniting investor interest in do - ability ; and not punishing legacy networks who got wedded to huawei and gang in a more innocent world .   of these , clean communication is a favourite . the message that huawei and the rest of xi 's dark knights are shady has gone far_and_wide . only vassal states of the middle_kingdom may not have got the point . but they really do not matter in this global war anyway .   sharp words are not new to briefing rooms in washington and beijing . " the ccp 's exploitation of this disaster to further its_own_interests has been disgraceful " , declared secretary   mike_pompeo on july_21   . " rather_than helping the world , general_secretary xi has shown the world the party 's true face . we talked_about how we 've_seen hong_kong 's freedoms crushed . we 've watched the ccp bully its neighbours , militarise features in the south_china_sea , and instigate a deadly_confrontation with india . "   " [ the british government ] made a sovereign decision to ban_huawei from future 5_g_networks .   we support those sovereign choices ; we think well done . "   xi 's mismanagement of the initial covid-19 outbreak and questionable tactics since , his actions in hong_kong , the south_china_sea and ladakh expanded the number of ' nays ' against a xi - dominated communication order .   the second pillar of us strategy is based in inclusion . unlike chinese 5_g , washington 's articulation of the future is about collaboration and not letting any state cross the line . pompeo explains :   the tide_is_turning toward trusted 5_g vendors and away from huawei . the world 's leading_telecom companiesTelefonica , orange , jio , Telstra , and many moreare becoming " clean_telcos . " they are rejecting doing_business with tools of the ccp surveillance state , like huawei .   notice how pompeo 's list of clean_telcos is not limited by

a most delicious friendship : a short history of pakistani - chinese cuisine a most delicious friendship : a short history of pakistani - chinese cuisine   chicken manchurian from yuan tung , karachi   it is well established that a majority of urban pakistanis love their chinese food . but unbeknownst to many , this circumstance has been the culmination of a long relationship that the chinese have had with the subcontinent . most chinese food found here belongs to a variant called indo - chinese food and more specifically , pakistani - chinese food . it is often a collection of tangy , sticky and spicy sauces that cling to different succulent meats served with a fresh plate of fried vegetable rice or chow mein noodles . these delicious dishes are part of a long_history of migration and hybrid cuisines , which have characterized the food of the chinese living in south_asia since colonial_times .   chinese immigrants have been in the subcontinent since the 18th_century , mostly centered_around calcutta during the british_raj . migrants came from the provinces of hubei , guangdong and shandong . many of the immigrants were Hakka , a distinct ethnic and linguist group that speaks their dialect instead of mandarin chinese . they spread to all parts of india as traders , artisans , shop_keepers , and of course , restaurant_owners .   chinese immigrants entered and dispersed around areas of pakistan in waves , following the country 's creation in 1947 , the sino - indian war_of_1962 , and the creation_of_bangladesh in 1971 . a majority moved to pakistan to escape indian persecution and internment_camps after 1962 , while others were chinese muslims who chose to settle in muslim - majority countries like pakistan . they often settled in major_cities like karachi and lahore , as_well_as smaller_towns like rawalpindi and abbottabad . chinese families had also set_up restaurants in dhaka and chittagong in east pakistan ; they had to move to west pakistan to escape political_turmoil and begin their life anew .   while there have been studies on chinese immigrant culture in india , rarely have there been academic works on chinese immigration to pakistan . according to anthropologist alice ping - hsiu lin , the chinese community in pakistan is not a monolith , but a diverse_group with nuanced identities , who regard themselves to be just as much south_asian as they are chinese .   a.b.c. restaurant in saddar market , karachi in the 1950s   some of the first chinese restaurants in pakistan opened in karachi . the first known record of a chinese restaurant in what is now pakistan , was a.b.c restaurant in the saddar_area of karachi , which was allegedly opened in the 1930s by a teacher named li Dianxian . it was said to have been

hindu student leader in us faces cyber - bullying for pointing_out_that sacred dharmic symbol ' swastika ' is different from nazi Hakenkreuz simran Tatuskar ( pic_via_twitter )   in an another instance of creeping hinduphobia rooted in abysmal cultural ignoranc , a hindu student leader in united_states was at the receiving_end of cyber - bullying campaign for suggesting that sacred dharmic symbol ' swastika ' is different from nazi Hakenkreuz .   simran Tatuskar , a student union leader at Brandeis university in massachusetts , was forced to issue_a_clarification after a concerted smear_campaign , which insinuated her of being an ' antisemite ' for pointing_out the dissimilarities between the two symbols .   the campaign against Tatuskar was spearheaded_by an organisation , StopAntiSemitism.org , which accused her of ' reinventing ' the swastika 's reputation in school_curriculum to present it as a peaceful symbol .   " Brandeis university_student union president , simran Tatuskar , wants to re - invent the swastika 's reputation in the school 's curriculum and present it as a peaceful symbol . and nope , she 's not jewish . but she is trying to normalize the largest symbol of hate in america , " the organisation claimed in a tweet .   student union president , simran Tatuskar , wants to re - invent the swastika 's reputation in the school 's curriculum and present it as a peaceful symbol .   and nope , she 's not jewish .   but she is trying to normalize the largest symbol of hate in america .   the online campaign_was_launched in response to a post on social_media that the student leader shared to protest_against the inclusion of swastika as one of the " symbols of hate " in a new_york senate   following the sustained_campaign against her , Tatsukar   Tatsukar said that she ' regrets ' the misunderstanding her post had caused and that as a non - jewish , she can not understand the feelings evoked by her post but she never wanted to harm anyone .   she said that the nazi Hakenkreuz " undoubtedly represents the horrors of the holocaust " .   " hitler tilted the swastika and turned it into a symbol of hate , " she said .   Tatsukar further said that though the ny senate bill aims to educate students on the historical impact of hate symbols , including the nazi swastika , but it_neglects to mention that the swastika is considered auspicious by hindus , jains and buddhists and has been an_important_part of the south_asian and east_asian culture historically .   " the current version of the bill erases and vilifies various cultures for using this symbol , " she said .   she further expressed_concern that the bill ,
covid19 in pakistan : test_positivity_rate and deaths declining in bangalore , a key technology hub in southern india where offices for major tech_companies like amazon and apple are located , the government ordered a weeklong lockdown that began tuesday_evening .   the initial boost that india 's economy received in june after the nationwide_lockdown was relaxed is being halted by these localized lockdowns in high - risk areas , experts_say . economic_indicators like labor participation rates and electricity_consumption are down this month compared to june , according to the center for monitoring indian economy , an independent think - tank .   india 's minister for small_and_medium_businesses , nitin_gadkari , said last_week that experts were predicting a loss of $ 133.3 billion in the next year .   as india 's coronavirus_caseload approaches 1 million , lockdowns are being reimposed in parts of the country as governments try to shield the health system from being overwhelmed .   india on wednesday reported nearly_30,000 new virus cases and 582 more deaths , raising its totals to more_than 936,000 cases and over 24,000 fatalities . the actual_numbers , like elsewhere globally , are likely far higher due to limited_testing and poor surveillance , experts_say .   a two - week lockdown that starts thursday has been imposed in bihar , an eastern state with a population of 128 million that is marred_by a fragile_health_system . since saturday , bihar has recorded over 1,000 cases each day , despite limited_testing .   nearly 2.5_million poor migrant_workers who had been stranded during india 's initial lockdown of the entire_country have returned to the state after they lost_their_jobs in large cities .   authorities are now increasingly trying to focus their lockdowns to shield the economy from further losses , and nearly a dozen states are turning to localized clampdowns in areas where many cases_have_been_detected . referred to as " containment_zones " by public_health_officials , these can be as small as a few houses on a street in new_delhi , the capital .   jayaprakash Muliyil , an epidemiologist at christian m

pressuring china with us - india naval_drills is pure vanity a us carrier_strike_group led by the aircraft_carrier_uss nimitz conducted military_exercises with indian warships near the andaman_and_nicobar archipelago on monday .   as china - india border_tensions linger and nationalist voices rise within india , demanding new_delhi to step up pressure on beijing in the sea to " acquire leverage over china , " this joint navy exercise has excited indian media .   they widely interpret this as a " strong strategic signal to china " and " a show of solidarity " between the us and india amid_tensions both countries face with china .   beijing does_n't have to buy such rabble - rousing . it 's normal for washington and new_delhi to conduct joint_military_exercises . the us conducts drills with many countries_around_the_world every year . this_is_not_the_first_time for washington and new_delhi to engage in naval_exercises . as long as the third - party exercises do_n't harm china 's interests , china does_n't have to feel targeted , or get annoyed .   besides , defense cooperation has grown over the years to become a key_component of the overall bilateral_partnership between india and the us - especially since us_president_donald_trump 's visit_to_india_in_february 2020 , his first such visit to the country .   during that trip , india and the us issued_a_joint_statement agreeing to " deepen defense and security cooperation , especially through greater maritime and space domain awareness and information_sharing ; joint cooperation ; exchange of military liaison personnel ; advanced training and expanded exercises between all services and special_forces . "   but noticeably , the clash_in_galwan_valley has provided the us with an opportunity to strengthen_cooperation with india and take_advantage of china - india border_disputes .   india and the us now have jointly_conducted military_drills in the indian_ocean . the possibility can_not_be_ruled_out that india may drop its neutral position over the south_china_sea issue and join the us in the so - called freedom_of_navigation_operations in the south_china_sea .   it has become clearer that the us is now intent to push china on all fronts . in order to target china , the us has taken actions , or tried to rope in countries that have disputes with china . in the short_term , these may put a certain amount of pressure on china with international public_opinion . but it will not impact current geostrategic situations . what china needs now is not to be easily agitated by it . to the contrary , china should manage its_own affairs well and remain_calm and rational in the face of provocations .   before sailing together with indian warships in the joint drill , the uss_nimitz carrier_strike_group , along with another one led by uss_ronald_reagan , had completed dual carrier operations in the south_china_sea . the us and india are obviously flexing their

pakistan , bangladesh premiers hold rare telephonic_talk call comes_amid quiet efforts to rebuild diplomatic_ties between_the_two_countries   the prime_ministers of pakistan and bangladesh held_a_telephonic_conversation on wednesday in a rare_occurrence of diplomacy as the two estranged countries seek rapprochement .   " pakistan_is_committed_to_deepening fraternal_relations with bangladesh on the basis_of_mutual_trust , mutual_respect and sovereign_equality , " said pm_imran_khan , according_to_a_statement_issued_by his office .   the premier_reiterated his invitation to sheikh_hasina to visit pakistan .   he extended_condolences for the lives_lost during the pandemic , and offered his commiserations_on_the_material_and_human losses due to the recent_flooding_in_bangladesh_and_prayed for early_recovery_of_the_people_affected by this natural_calamity .   he also apprised her of his ' global_initiative_on_debt_relief ' for developing_countries .   in the bilateral context , imran underscored_the_importance pakistan attaches to closer_ties with fraternal bangladesh and highlighted_the_significance of regular_bilateral_contacts and people - to - people exchanges .   reaffirming pakistan 's commitment to saarc , imran underlined_the_importance of both countries working for enhanced regional_cooperation for sustainable_peace and prosperity .   he shared pakistan 's perspective_on_the_grave situation in the indian - occupied_jammu_&_kashmir ( ioj&k ) and stressed_on_the_importance of a peaceful_resolution of the jammu_and_kashmir_dispute for a safe_and_prosperous region .   the express_tribune had recently reported on quiet diplomatic_efforts being initiated by the two countries , citing diplomatic_sources who revealed that the current regional_security_environment compelled the two to reset their troubled ties .   earlier_this_month , pakistan 's high_commissioner imran_ahmed_siddiqui held a rare meeting with bangladesh foreign_minister_ak_abdul_momen in dhaka . the meeting raised_eyebrows in new_delhi , which viewed the development with suspicion .   the bangladesh government called the meeting a " courtesy call " but sources said it was much more_than that . it is believed that imran - hasina telephonic_conversation on wednesday ( today ) was the result of that meeting .   relations_between_the_two_countries have remained_tense for the last many years . the two countries have yet to overcome the bitter_memories of 1971 that led to the creation_of_bangladesh .   what led to the current low in their ties was the decision taken a_few_years_ago by the incumbent_government of shaikh hasina_wajid to try and execute several leaders of bangladesh jamaat - e - islami on charges of committing_war_crimes in 1971 .   pakistan was against such , what it called , politically_motivated trials . it also accused dhaka of violating the 1974 trilateral_agreement between pakistan , india and bangladesh . under the agreement , all countries including bangladesh had agreed not to pursue cases against people involved in the 1971 events .   relationship_between_the_two_countries worsened to the extent that pakistan 's national_assembly in 2016 passed_a_unanimous_resolution condemning the execution of ji_leaders .   not just that the bangladesh government refused to approve the appointment of pakistani high_commissioner for 20 months . islamabad eventually had to make the fresh proposal for the appointment of imran_ahmed_siddiqui as envoy_to_dhaka . his

china and france pledge more cooperation on plane sales , 5_g video meeting tuesday lays_out key economic , tech priorities   sign of cooperation may give airbus a sales leg up on boeing   china and france promised to work more closely in areas ranging_from aircraft sales to 5_g_networks in a video meeting that highlighted some of the countries ' biggest economic concerns during the pandemic - driven slump and an intensifying rivalry with the u.s.   the two_sides " strongly value active discussions " between planemaker   and chinese airlines on jet deliveries this year , as_well_as deeper ties in the future , they said in a   published tuesday by china 's ministry_of_finance . the document summarized the meeting , co-   by vice_premier hu Chunhua and french finance_minister bruno le_maire .   handing_over planes on schedule to chinese customers would be a boon for airbus over the coming_months . the toulouse , france - based planemaker has had to scale back production after the coronavirus_outbreak halted travel , forcing aircraft customers to seek delivery delays and cancellations .   airbus competes fiercely with u.s. rival   over business in china , the world 's second - largest aviation market , and the deals often get shaped by broader trade priorities . without_naming chinese telecom_giant   , the joint_statement also hinted_at another u.s. sensitivity -- beijing 's sales pitch for chinese 5_g_technology .   " geopolitics has an unpleasant way of intruding in china jetliner purchases , " said richard Aboulafia , an analyst with Teal group . " still , this is less of an opportunity to score orders and more about protecting against cancellations and deferrals , as china has been hit by the virus as badly as anybody . "   while the statement reflects a sense of cooperation with europe , china 's relations with the u.s. have been worsening amid_growing tensions over issues including trade , concern about spying with huawei networks , and the new security laws beijing has imposed on hong_kong .   the standoff with washington could hand airbus an advantage as it seeks to hold on to orders while airlines slash their capacity .   airbus has a final assembly line in china for its aircraft as_well_as a completion and delivery center for its widebody a330 aircraft , both of which have helped the planemaker continue to make deliveries to chinese customers despite the pandemic . still , the manufacturer only made 36 aircraft deliveries last_month , so additional pressure on chinese airlines to meet commitments would be welcome .   airbus could n't immediately be reached_for_comment .   the talks between china and france also covered

are ghosts haunting the british_museum ? are ghosts haunting the british_museum ?   inexplicable noises , spectral sightings , sudden drops in temperature   something strange is going on at the british_museum . as the clamour over colonial restitution grows , Killian fox investigates the collection 's restless objects   n the late_evening , after the last members of the public have been ushered out of the building and the outer gates have been bolted shut , a swift and palpable change comes over the british_museum .   the museum is the most_popular tourist_attraction in britain , ahead of tate modern and the national gallery : more_than 6.2 m people visited in 2019 , over 17,000 every day . without these visitors , the relentless thrum of activity beneath the glass - and - steel lattice roof of the great court fades to a whisper . a thick silence fills the cavernous galleries that surround it , each one loaded with artefacts that encompass the arc of human history .   by the time the night_shift begins , most of the lights in the museum have been extinguished . the security staff , who patrol the length_and_breadth of the 14 - acre complex until early_morning , carry_out many of their duties by torchlight . scouring the premises for anomalies   water leaks , the smell of gas , an employee trapped in a remote corridor   they cast their beams into dark corners , the shadows melting back to reveal a war - like roman bust or an Aztec mask with shining eyes and teeth . they may even confront a real human being , like the body of an ancient egyptian , 5,500 years dead , huddled_inside a reconstruction of his sandy grave .   even without visitors , the museum is never completely_silent . the main building , which dates_back to the 1820s and has been expanded and reconfigured ever_since , is alive with creaks , as old buildings are prone to be . the air - conditioning hums . doors clank . sudden breezes whistle around corners and up lift shafts . as security_guards move through the 94 rooms open to the public , along the rabbit warren of back - of - house offices and passageways , and into the rambling network of storage_facilities below ground , they are privy to the building 's most intimate sounds : scrapes and groans , drowned out during opening hours , can grow disconcertingly loud at night .   the guards are accustomed to such disturbances . but every so often a patrol encounters a noise , a flash of movement , or simply a sudden lurch in the pit of the stomach , that stops even hardened veterans in their tracks .   the sutton hoo helmet ,

" we 're trying to move to hydroelectricity . kohala and azad_pattan_power projects as_well_as the diamer - bhasha_dam would produce hydroelectricity . there are other projects in the pipeline too , " he added .   the cpec_authority_chairman said that apart_from hydroelectricity , in order to produce cheap_electricity , we have to run the coal - based_power_plants with indigenously produced coal instead of the imported_ones .   talking_about the much - debated pace of cpec , he clarified that despite the situation_arising from covid-19 pandemic , the work on the mega_project continued . " we managed to carry on the work with our own workforce and the chinese also came via special_flights . this shows the interest on both_sides , " he said .   in order to improve pakistan 's growth , the country has to increase its export and limit the imports , said the cpec_authority_chairman .   highlighting_the_importance of special_economic_zones ( sezs ) in cpec , he said that a 1,000 - acre_land has been acquired in rashakai in khyber - pakhtunkhwa , adding that the ground - breaking of allama_iqbal_industrial_city in faisalabad has also been performed .   bajwa said that
under_the_guise of friendship , china is looting pakistan under_the_guise of friendship , china is looting pakistan   pakistan and china define their friendship as " higher_than the heights of the himalayas and deeper than the depths of the arabian_sea . " to make it even stronger , president_xi_jinping of china visited pakistan in april 2015 , with a multibillion - dollar_investment plan   the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) , the main plank of xi 's belt_and_road_initiative ( bri ) .   china has always defined the bri as a win - win situation , implying that both china and host_countries would enjoy the resultant economic_prosperity . the truth , however , is completely_different .   basically , " win - win " probably meant that china would " win twice . " unfortunately , the cpec has burdened pakistan 's economy with a lot of debt and trade_deficits , and pushed the country on to the brink_of_bankruptcy . as well , china did_not provide pakistan with industrial technology to help it boost_exports , nor did it create many jobs in the country   because the project has mostly hired chinese laborers .   basically , ' win - win ' probably meant that china would ' win twice '   it was the burden of chinese debt that forced sri_lanka to hand over its hambantota_port to china and a massive piece_of_land in colombo to chinese multinational_corporations , in return for debt_relief . the fear of a debt_trap pushed malaysian_prime_minister_mahathir_mohamad ( pictured below ) to halt the contract for china_communications_construction_company to build the east_coast rail_link , thought to have cost the government around us$ 20 billion , along with a $_2.5_billion agreement for an arm of a chinese energy_giant to construct gas_pipelines . he had earlier suspended the projects , leading some analysts to believe that he wanted to renegotiate the terms during his china trip .   story of a so - called friend   honestly , you ca_n't call a country your friend when it forces you to buy its equipment and material to be used in its projects   a port , coal - fired_power_plants , roads and railways ( the cpec ) . and when this exercise severely shreds your dollar reserves and piles up government expenses , this so - called friend offers a helping_hand in the form of billion - dollar debts so that you can keep importing from it .   ultimately , you find yourself in the middle_of_nowhere . your people suffer ; you arrange a funeral_ceremony of your economy with just enough foreign_reserves that you can barely afford imports of two months . then the so - called friend offers you some more debt , so that you_can_buy necessary goods ( or otherwise , your citizens will_starve )

Alor Setar high_court_judge Arik Sanusi heard from a lawyer_representing the rohingya and a deputy public_prosecutor before delivering his decision wednesday , according defense attorney collin andrew .   andrew said judge Arik based his decision on the rohingyas ' status as refugees and noted the situation in myanmar 's rakhine_state , the home of the stateless muslim_minority group .   " these persons are rohingya_refugees who are in need of international protection due to the persecution faced by them .   as_a_result and in line with the international principle of non - refoulement , they can_not_be returned , " andrew told_benarnews , quoting from judge Arik 's ruling .   the judge cited several other grounds including that the rohingya were not habitual offenders nor were they violent , so it was inhumane to punish them this way , according to the lawyer .   " judge Arik also said that these persons are registered with unhcr as refugees , a sentence of whipping will only add to their sufferings , " andrew said .   the judge also instructed that six 17 - year - old rohingya who are serving seven months for entering the country illegally be released to unhcr   the united_nations_refugee_agency   upon completion of their sentences on july_27 .   the rohingya were charged on march_23 with illegal_entry under the immigration act .   on june_23 , 40 rohingya pleaded_guilty after the charges were read before magistrate mohd Ridzuan Salleh in langkawi magistrate_court , the malay daily_newspaper Sinar Harian reported , basing its information on a statement from the malaysia maritime enforcement_agency . langkawi is a district of kedah .   it reported that the magistrate had sentenced 31 men to seven months in jail and three lashes each and nine women to seven months in jail .   on wednesday , andrew said the number of men sentenced to be caned was just 27 , adding they were not represented by an attorney when their case first went before the magistrate 's court .   " i applied for the court appeal on july_6 when i found out about the sentence , " he said .   the immigration act allows for fines , imprisonment of five_years and caning for those convicted of entering malaysia illegally . according to andrew , judges in previous decisions had said they

eu to limit tech exports to hong_kong after chinese clampdown eu to limit tech exports to hong_kong after chinese clampdown   brussels ( reuters ) - the european_union will limit technology exports to hong_kong that may be used for repression or surveillance , an eu draft document seen_by_reuters said , in the bloc 's first concrete reaction to the chinese security_clampdown on the territory .   expressing " grave_concern " for a sweeping national_security_law imposed by china on the former_british_colony , the 27 eu states agreed on friday to a series of sanctions , including trade curbs and a review of visa agreements with the territory .   the document , backed by eu ambassadors , says the bloc will be " further scrutinising and limiting exports of specific sensitive equipment and technologies for end - use in hong_kong , in particular where there are grounds to suspect undesirable use relating to internal repression , the interception of internal communications or cybersurveillance " .   the document is expected to enter_into_force on tuesday .   the beijing - drafted national_security_law punishes what china broadly defines as subversion , secession , terrorism and collusion_with_foreign_forces with up to life_in_prison .   critics of the law fear it will crush the wide - ranging freedoms promised to the territory when it returned to chinese_rule_in_1997 , including the right to protest and an independent legal system .   supporters of the law say it will bring_stability after last_year 's often - violent anti - government and anti - china unrest .   the european_union also committed to " considering the implications of the national_security_legislation for asylum , migration , visa and residence policy " , the document said .   the bloc will not launch any new negotiation with hong_kong for the time being and will review the implications of the security law on existing_agreements it has with hong_kong .   the agreed measures could be applied by the european_union or its member_states " as deemed_appropriate " , the document says .   the european_union reiterated_its_support for hong_kong 's autonomy and its citizens , pledging to further engaging with the civil_society there .   the impact of the adopted measures will be reviewed before the end of the year .   reporting by gabriela Baczynska , writing by francesco Guarascio @fraguarascio ; editing_by_nick_macfie
in landmark speech , pompeo says china is world 's biggest_threat in landmark speech , pompeo says china is world 's biggest_threat   pompeo seeks to build international coalition to combat communist vision   secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo on thursday identified china as the world 's greatest_threat and called on western_nations to unite against beijing as part of a global effort_to_eradicate the communist_party 's growing control of the international order .   in one of his most significant foreign_policy speeches since taking office , pompeo railed_against the communist_party 's gross_human_rights_abuses , cyber_espionage operations , and routine bullying of western_nations . pompeo said the world must immediately act to ensure that communist china 's vision for world dominance is not realized .   pompeo_spoke frankly about the dangers communist_ideology poses to the world and sought to reestablish america 's democratic_principles , saying the country will never bow_before beijing .   " if we do_n't act now , ultimately , the ccp will erode our freedoms and subvert the rules - based order free societies have built , " pompeo said during his remarks at theRichard nixon presidential library and museum in california . " if we bend the knee now , our children 's children may be at the mercy of the ccp , whose actions are the primary challenge to the free world . if the free world does_n't change communist china , communist china will change us . there_can_be_no return to past practices just because they 're comfortable or convenient . "   the location of the speech was not a coincidence . pompeo chose the nixon presidential library due to nixon 's efforts to open up relations with china . while pompeo praised nixon 's efforts_to_bring china into the community of nations , he warned that continued deference to beijing would change the world for the worst . pompeo 's speech marked the fourth time in recent_weeks that senior trump_administration officials took china to task on the public stage . white_house national_security_adviser_robert_o'brien delivered a similar speech last_month , as did attorney_general_william_barr . the goal of these speeches has been to wake_up the american people and western_nations to the threat_posed_by communist china .   america 's engagement with china has backfired , pompeo said .   he also said america can not continue to deal with china as if it is an honest broker . the communist_party thrives on deceit and has no interest in playing fair with other nations . this has been on full_display as china hacks international businesses , stealing their trade_secrets and proprietary research . it lied_about the coronavirus_pandemic , leading to chaos and death across the world . and china eagerly serves as a top ally of america 's top enemies , including iran and russia .

" the report said the export_controls are expected to take effect on tuesday .   however , experts noted that there will be limited impact on hong_kong as local police have been using equipment made from the chinese_mainland since last_year .   " such products used to come from the us , uk , france_and_germany mainly , but hong_kong is able to find substitutes from the chinese_mainland , other countries_and_regions if the eu implements the limits , " liang Haiming , a hong_kong - based economist , told_the_global_times_on_saturday .   the eu 's latest measure is a response to us ' requests , but the eu does_n't_want to offend china just for pleasing the us , so the bloc only limited products that are not commonly_used to avoid china 's countermeasures , liang noted .   hong_kong is a major export_market for eu products which enter the city with no tariffs , according to hong_kong 's trade and industry department . in 2018 , hong_kong 's major imports from the eu were pearls and precious_stones , non - electric engines , travel goods and handbags , silver and platinum , jewelry and aircraft and associated equipment .   in addition , the city is a vital entrepot for trade between the chinese_mainland and the eu . in 2018 , more_than 10 billion_euros ( $ 11.66 billion ) of the mainland 's imports from the eu came through hong_kong , said the department .   to aid its economy amid the covid-19 pandemic , the eu

" false_accusations of blasphemy and the ensuing violence , the number of children engaged in labour under hazardous conditions and unabated violence_against_women remain grim markers of the last_year , " the commission said .   " deaths linked to terrorism may have decreased , but the ' soft_targets ' of religious_minorities and law_enforcement_agencies continue to bear_the_brunt of violence , " it said .   journalists and bloggers continue to sustain threats , attacks and abductions , and the blasphemy_law serves to coerce people into silence . the people 's right to socio_cultural activities is curtailed by intolerance and extremism , and authorities are lenient for fear of a political backlash , it said .   the 296 - page_report said , " in a year when freedom of thought , conscience and religion continued to be stifled , incitement to hatred and bigotry increased , and tolerance receded even further , the state remained ineffective in tackling the issue of persecution_of_minorities and fell far short of its obligations .   there_was_no abatement in violence_against_religious_minorities , with christians , Ahmedis , hazaras , hindus_and_sikhs all coming under attack , it said .

why has the us abruptly turned against china ? : global_times_editorial why has the us abruptly turned against china ? : global_times_editorial   why has the us unexpectedly turned against china ? is there still room for china and the us to ease_tensions and avoid an all - out confrontation ?   this is the most common sentiment among us political_elites : the us has been in contact with china since the early_1970s , and has long believed that the market economy boom , brought by such contact , will eventually_lead to the so - called political liberalization in china . however , they are completely disappointed now .   we believe such an explanation is the us elites ' selective self - beautification , as_well_as their moral mobilization of the us and the western world 's confrontation_with_china .   the dtente in the china - us relations started with former us president_richard_nixon 's china visit in 1972 during the peak of the cold_war . the us , forced by the cold_war , had to take the initiative to approach china . at that time , china had a sharp ideological confrontation with the west . but the rapprochement of china - us relations reshaped the geopolitical structure of the asia - pacific_region and affected the trend of the cold_war . this was washington 's true purpose .   after china 's reform and opening - up in late_1970s , china and the us formed a wide_range of contacts . but until the end of the 1980s , the us ' biggest consideration for china had been using china 's power to accumulate bargaining_chips against the soviet_union .   after the end of the cold_war and throughout the 1990s , washington 's strategic focus was to digest its achievements during the cold_war . china , as an emerging_market , attracted the huge interest from the us during that period . the us conservative elites have never given up hostility_toward china , but the huge_potential of the chinese market prevented the spread of such hostility .   after the us ' counter - terror war , the sense of major power_competition was strengthened again in the us . china 's rise has gradually reached the critical point of us strategic tolerance . the trump_administration considers china the us ' largest strategic_competitor . us policy_toward_china has undergone a fundamental reversion .   the us never faced a country like china before - a huge country with rapid development and unlimited potential . washington 's political_elites are panicking . their cold_war_mentality has been fully mobilized . the us ' hegemonic interests have been placed in an overwhelming position in the china - us relations , and the two countries ' huge economic_interests have been relegated to the back seat . it seems the us has

why russia supports armenia against azerbaijan in the caucasus conflict why russia supports armenia against azerbaijan in the caucasus conflict   moscow has played_a_significant_role in propelling the conflict between_the_two_neighbours by creating autonomous_regions in azerbaijan and drawing controversial borders .   behind the ongoing border_conflict between azerbaijan_and_armenia , there are growing signs of russia 's old realpolitik , as moscow openly backs yerevan against baku .   since the early years of its formation , russia , which is mainly based on a synthesis of Slavism and orthodox christianity , has always seen itself as the protector state of Slavic nations and orthodox_christians .   " russia has traditionally supported armenia very much . traditionally , it will . historically , armenia has looked at russia as its protector . that goes back to the fact that those are primarily orthodox christian countries . it also goes back to all the 1915 events and also nagorno - karabakh [ dispute ] , " said matthew Bryza , the former us ambassador to azerbaijan and a senior_fellow_at the atlantic_council .   the 1915 events refer to political and military circumstances in world_war i , when russia - backed armenians aimed to create an_independent_state in the eastern Anatolian territories of the ottoman_empire . the clashes_between the ottoman and armenian_forces caused human_losses of great magnitude on both_sides .   for centuries , moscow remained_focused on the balkans in eastern_europe , and Caucasia , which is located between the central_asia and russian mainlands . the russian_empire and its tsarist regimes fought the ottoman_empire and its allies in both regions for centuries . the balkans and Caucasia have always had significant Slavic and orthodox christian populations .   at_the_same_time , moscow 's policy has required the statecraft to suppress muslim and turkic aspirations across those regions , while allying with friendly_nations like serbia and armenia , using them to create spheres_of_influence across the balkans and Caucasia .   " we can clearly say that russia is on the side of armenia against azerbaijan . armenia de_facto looks_like a region of russia . almost all of the armenian economy has been controlled by russia . armenia 's defence is also at the hands of russia , " said Bulent Aras , professor_of_international_relations_at istanbul policy center - Sabanci university .   " russia and armenia have tight military and economic relations , which go beyond the borders of a normal alliance . this aspect can_not_be discardable , " Aras told trt_world .   like syria , armenia also hosts a russian_military base in the east of the country across turkey 's Kars province , which had previously been contended by moscow as part of russia . ankara , which has a military_base in azerbaijan , has historically allied with baku against yerevan .

matiullah_jan 's abduction shows that pakistan 's security state hates the press , whatever imran_khan says no , mr. prime_minister , pakistan does_not ...   imran_khan claims there 's nothing_wrong . abductions and terror say otherwise .   kaneez_sughra , the wife of abducted pakistani_journalist_matiullah_jan , displays a photograph of her_husband on her mobile_phone next to her son in islamabad on july_21 .   AAmii qureshi / afp_via_getty_images   one year ago this week , pakistani prime_minister_imran_khan sat next to u.s. president_donald_trump in the white_house and   to reporters that pakistan has " one of the freest presses in the world . " he added : " so to say that there are curbs on [ pakistan 's ] press is a joke . "   in reality , there 's nothing funny about the state of pakistan 's media environment today . the apparent abduction on july_21 of a prominent_journalist , matiullah_jan , in broad_daylight in islamabad underscores the perils of a pakistani media climate victimized by a broader , and increasingly robust , crackdown_on_dissent .   according to local and international news reports , jan was picked_up outside the school where his_wife , kaneez_sughra , works . sughra   : " the doors of his car were open , and the keys were still inside .   i could see from the car that he was taken forcibly . " fortunately , later in the day , jan_was_released . on july_23 , he released a   on his youtube_channel in which he described his ordeal . he said that " those who kidnapped me are the same forces who have been against democracy " in pakistan . " police uniform or plain_clothes , these days everyone is on the same_page . " but if history is any guide , there will be little effort to investigate and hold_accountable those behind the incident .   jan has long been a sharp critic of the pakistani state , including a military that is violently allergic to public criticism . he was fired from his job as a tv_anchor in 2018 , a move many believe was made under military pressure . earlier_this_month , a tweet he posted about the judiciary prompted the supreme_court to   a contempt_of_court_notice against himcertainly not the first time pakistani courts have used this   against the press . he was scheduled_to_attend a hearing on july_22 .   jan 's brief disappearance comes at a moment when islamabad is stepping_up_efforts to stifle_dissent , thereby exposing the fragility of democracy in a nation still struggling to shake_off the legacy of military rule .   pakistan is home to a lively press with dozens of private print and broadcast outlets and many new online_portals . it is willing_and_able to expose , critique ,
seven - figure pay packages kept rolling in for newspaper ceos in 2019 , even as industry declines accelerated pay stayed high last_year   for those who retained their jobs , and even for executives on their way out as their companies floundered financially .   another year , another disconnect in how newspaper companies performed financially and what ceos and other top_executives took home in their pay envelopes .   my scan of executive compensation tables at six public companies again reflects that c - suite leaders did just fine even if their companies did badly .   i did notice a twist from   a similar report i compiled a year ago   : a substantial_number of the executives are now gone from their jobs . the attrition hit three of four top earners at tribune_publishing , two of three at gannett and two of three at mcclatchy .   the pay disclosures appear in proxy statements ( form 14 - a ) filed with the securities_and_exchange_commission before annual_meetings , most of them this spring .   if you believe the party line among big companies that executives are tasked with creating value for shareholders , the four - person executive team at the new_york_times co. earned their millions   ceo_mark thompson , $ 6,144,106 ; chief_operating_officer meredith Kopit Levien , $_3,111,893 ; chief_financial_officer roland Caputo , $ 2,497,689 ; and publisher a.g. sulzberger , $ 2,075,313 .   other newspaper share prices were declining or collapsing   , new_york_times stock rose about 25 % in 2019 ( and is up by another third this year ) . that translates to an added value of more_than $_1_billion for shareholders .   Kopit Levien has been a rising_star at the company for some time and wednesday   as thompson announced his retirement .   at the rest of the companies , big pay appears more problematic .   tribune_publishing had something of a revolving_door at the top . departing ceo justin dearborn earned $_1,315,394 ; his successor timothy knight , $ 2,154,340 . knight himself was let go in early 2020 in favor of terry jimenez , who had earned $_1,909,420 as chief_financial_officer in 2019 .   ross Levinsohn , the los_angeles - based entertainment executive who for a time was ceo of tribune interactive and publisher of the los_angeles_times , was paid $_1,630,298 . big plans for new digital ventures hatched by former ceo michael Ferro and Levinsohn never materialized . at   the time of his_resignation ,   Levinsohn was the subject of sexual_harassment charges . he had received bonus grants of $_6.5 million to join the company in 2017 .   gannett was acquired by gatehouse parent new media investment group in november ( retaining the gannett

" i have no_doubt in my_mind that all collusive designs of the adversarial_forces would_be_responded_with_full vigour and force , " a source_quoted him as saying .   sources explained that even as the lac   in ladakh has heated up , steps_have_been_taken to counter any possible action by pakistan along_the_line_of_control ( loc ) or the international border ( ib ) .   they said that pakistan 's silence has been particularly surprising because they have not heated up the loc as expected and nor have any large - scale movements taken place .   that the reason_why the army is being cautious about the disengagement with china in ladakh is because it feels beijing could drag the whole process through the winter and use the distraction to make mischief elsewhere , possibly in the northeast .   " the fear is that , while china will force us to stay_engaged in ladakh , it might do
india 's nuclear strategy shifts focus from pakistan to china , beijing now in range of new_delhi 's missiles : report india 's nuclear strategy shifts focus from pakistan to china , beijing now in range of new_delhi 's missiles : report   the report said that this posture has likely been reinforced after the 2017_doklam_standoff , during which chinese and indian_troops were placed_on_high_alert over a dispute near the bhutanese border .   india 's nuclear strategy , which has traditionally focused on pakistan , has now increased emphasis on china .   beijing is now in the range of indian missiles , according to a report .   the report said that this posture has likely been reinforced after the 2017_doklam_standoff .   india 's nuclear strategy , which has traditionally focused on pakistan , has now increased emphasis on china , and beijing is now in the range of indian missiles , according to a report . the report said that this posture has likely been reinforced after the 2017_doklam_standoff , during which chinese and indian_troops were placed_on_high_alert over a dispute near the bhutanese border .   an analysis of india 's nuclear forces published in the bulletin of atomic scientists on july 20 by hans m. Kristensen and matt Korda makes this observation . the authors said , " while india 's primary deterrence relationship is with pakistan , its nuclear modernization indicates that it is putting increased emphasis on its future strategic_relationship with china . all the new agni missiles have ranges that indicate their primary target is china . this posture is likely to be reinforced after the 2017_doklam_standoff , during which chinese and indian_troops were placed_on_high_alert over a dispute near the bhutanese border . tension remained high in 2019 , with troop injuries_on_both_sides of the border . "   " the expansion of india 's nuclear posture to take a conventionally and nuclear superior china into account will result in significantly new capabilities being deployed over_the_next_decade , which could_potentially also influence how india views the role of its nuclear_weapons against pakistan , " they said .   " according to one scholar , " we may be witnessing what i call a ' decoupling ' of indian nuclear strategy between china and pakistan . the force requirements india needs in order to credibly threaten assured retaliation against china may allow it to pursue more aggressive strategies   such as escalation dominance or a ' splendid first strike '   against pakistan " , " the report said .   " india has long adhered to a nuclear no - first - use policy , even_though the policy was weakened by india 's 2003 declaration that it could_potentially use nuclear_weapons in response to chemical or biological attacks ( which would , therefore , constitute

how equity is lost when companies hire only workers with_disabilities employment remains an elusive goal for many . a recent hiring strategy may win pats on the back , but advocates fear it may pigeonhole people_with_disabilities .   exploring how the americans with_disabilities act has shaped modern life for people_with_disabilities .   as a summer associate , haley moss wanted to be writing motions and attending depositions   not analyzing data . but that 's what she_found_herself doing at her new law_firm job in 2017 . her manager knew she had autism , and ms. moss said she wondered_if the job duties given to her were based_on_assumptions that she could synthesize information " like a human supercomputer . " the miami - based lawyer felt similar constraints at other jobs .   " i_think it 's a really difficult thing to unpack because as a new lawyer , of course i wanted to learn anything i could and always wanted to have important work to do , " said ms. moss , 25 , who in january_2019 became the first openly autistic lawyer to be sworn into the florida bar . " but i always felt this pressure to perform above level at times in those types of technical tasks to live up to the belief . i did_n't_want to disappoint anyone . "   in the three_decades since the passage of the americans with_disabilities act , employment has remained an elusive goal for many people . thirty - one percent of people_with_disabilities , ages 16 to 64 , had a job in 2019 , compared with 75_percent of those without disabilities , according to the   but in the last_five_years , many businesses have adopted hiring_practices that prioritize workers with_disabilities , often receiving praise for their diverse hiring efforts . some of these companies start as family restaurants or retail_stores that build their brands around hiring only people_with_disabilities , sometimes operating as charities to save_money . in the technology sector , companies such as   have created programs designed for   these well - intentioned strategies are an improvement from what are known as sheltered workshops , which disability rights_advocates said can become exploitative make - work programs that paid below minimum_wage and segregated them from the competitive work force and their communities .   but advocates said this new targeted_approach should_not_be the end goal because it could still sequester people_with_disabilities and limit their options for employment . activists also said it set a low bar for companies that expected a pat on the back for hiring workers with_disabilities , when that should be the norm for all industries .   " yes , it 's better_than a sheltered workshop , but what it does_n't give that i_think is so important for people_with_disabilities is the opportunity to work alongside
activists fight to end violence during childbirth many medical_professionals in mexico have been known to insult , scold and do physical_harm to patients during childbirth . now activists want to change this , as they push for new laws , inform women of their rights , and promote use of midwives and doulas .   hidalgo , mexico   daniela Hernndez , 19 and pregnant for the first time , stretches and bends using an exercise ball beneath a 2 - meter ( 6.5 - foot ) mural_depicting a woman wrapped in branches emerging from the earth .

Guerrero 's help is supposed to ensure that Hernndez 's birth experience is free of the emotional and physical trauma that was once routine for many women during delivery .   their partnership is part of a quiet revolution that has slowly taken hold in the country , where many doctors_and_nurses were known to ridicule , scold , insult and otherwise humiliate patients when they gave_birth .

chocolate is good for your heart , study_finds chocolate is good for your heart , study_finds   but only if you have it once a week   from the us has a treat for chocolate lovers . it has found that chocolate helps your heart stay_healthy .   but there 's a catch . it only helps if you have it once a week .   chocolate has several nutrients that have been declared cardioprotective . these include flavanols , methylxanthines , polyphenols and stearic acid . in simpler terms , they are antioxidants which are great for the heart and immune_system .   Flavanols can reduce the size of dead tissue after a heart_attack , prevent clots from forming and help blood_vessels function better by improving blood flow .   Methylxanthines help the heart work better . Polyphenols facilitate nitric oxide synthesis which strengthens the walls of blood_vessels and the muscles of the heart .   Stearic acid reduces mean platelet volume , which will in turn reduce the size of the clot in the heart 's blood_vessels .   " overall , the benefits of nutrients in chocolate appear promising and chocolate consumption at_least once a week may be beneficial for cad ( coronary_artery_disease ) prevention , " said the authors_of_the_study .   cad is a disease where the blood_vessels supplying oxygen to the heart are damaged . this causes heart cells to die which can even prove to be fatal .   but how much chocolate should you eat for it to be beneficial ?   " moderate amounts of chocolate seem to protect the coronary arteries but it 's likely that large_quantities do not , " said lead_author dr Chayakrit Krittanawong .   the researchers based their results on an analysis of six studies of more_than 333,000 people who were followed for around nine years .   those who consumed chocolate once a week were eight percent less_likely to develop coronary_artery_disease than the participants who had no chocolate or not as often as once a week .   however , the authors have warned that calories , sugar , milk , and fat in commercially produced chocolate can cancel out the benefits for the heart .   their solution is : " dark chocolate consumption at_least once a week ( as a substitute for sugared candy ) with overall caloric intake tracking is probably safe .

" she questioned .   sherry_rehman said , " the purpose of the authority is to coordinate better between 16 ministries that are involved in the inter - ministerial coordination . the lapses in the project occur due to mismanagement and lack of strategic planning . either way it is important to establish strong ministerial capacity and leadership in moving projects forward with inclusion and transparency .

beijing 's strategic messaging shifts to west_asia- the new_indian_express beijing 's strategic messaging shifts to west_asia   a strong china - iran link in the economic and strategic domains will counter the us attempt_to_shift the focus of the world to the indo - pacific   all these years , many analysts wondered_why china was so tentative about expanding business and strategic links with iran in a bigger and more transparent way that would convey its clear disagreement with the us policy on iran . the us re - imposed_sanctions after it pulled_out of the joint_comprehensive_plan_of_action ( jcpoa ) in 2018 , but some short - term concessions were available to nations such as india and china that obtained much of their energy needs from iran . india had its compulsions about adherence to us directives due to its emerging relationship with america . it needed that nation 's support for its technological_development and other considerations , which have helped develop the emerging indo - us strategic_partnership and kept it on an even keel .   it seems the chinese too had some compulsions and did_not get their energy_requirements from iran to the extent they needed . china 's oil_imports reduced almost six times over six_months within 2019 . as per the much - respected singapore - based analyst james dorsey , " numerous agreements_signed by presidents xi_jinping and hassan_rouhani during the chinese leader 's visit to the middle_east in 2016 would , if implemented , expand economic relations_between_the_two_countries by a factor of ten to $_600_billion and significantly_enhance military cooperation . " a natural surmise is that china yet lacked strategic confidence to implement those agreements in the face of us sanctions ; recall that the trump_administration 's trade - related coercion was just about taking_shape . thus even_though it is well_known that sino - iran deliberations over these deals never ceased , something changed in beijing 's approach in the emerging run - up to the post covid-19 geopolitical order .   unconfirmed_reports about a freshly leaked draft 18 - page agreement between iran and china appear to indicate a move towards transformation of the strategic scenario in the middle_east , an area that has not received much chinese attention except for its energy needs . the chinese now seem more confident of defying us sanctions to pursue their_own_interests , as is evident from the nature of the impending deal that could be worth_$_400 billion over 25 years , including guaranteed supply of discounted energy .   while it is yet early to assume that the deal will go through , its deliberately leaked draft is being used to carry_out strategic messaging , which appears_to_be china 's new way of conducting geopolitics . this messaging is being done through actions on multiple frontsHong kong , taiwan , south_china_sea , australia , india and now iran
xi plans to control pak 's political economy through cpec -ani authority hong_kong , july_26 ( ani ): over the years , china has repeatedly attempted to take ultimate control of pakistan 's political and economic_affairs . since 2016 , president_xi_jinping has been pushing for the china - economic_corridor pakistan ( cpec ) and a cpec_authority that would place the country 's infrastructure and power_generation_projects under its direct control . although the proposal was rejected by the nawaz_sharif government , it was ultimately accepted by the prime_minister_imran_khan according to an article by ali_salman Andani in the asia times , khan , a puppet of the military_establishment , was able to manipulate the law to meet xi 's desires to control the pakistani ministry of planning . , whose top officials could implicitly scrutinize and resist xi 's draconian cpec program , as they had access to all secret_documents on the deal and were invaded , " Andani said . " as long as the reins were under the control of ' civil institutions headed_by representatives of the people and officials , deep accountability for xi 's master_plan at_least at some level and at some point   if not immediately   was possible . sidelining civil institutions completely would allow xi to play both_sides of the board , " he said . questioning the nature of the deal , the author said the secretary marine affairs had refused to show the highly confidential deal even to the senate_standing_committee . according to the article , by_2050 xi plans to have ultimate control over the majority of emerging_market_economies . Andani said : " xi does_not_want the belt_and_road_initiative or any of its components to be_held_responsible or faced with resistance . he knows that his chinese dream of indoctrination of a majority of the world 's free peoples by_2050 will not come_true if the peoples of the countries affected by the bri come to know his strategy to destroy their future and that of their generations . futures . he said that the authority of the cpec will be the authorized_representative of the communist_party_of_china ( cpc ) in pakistan responsible for designing , implementing , expanding , enforcing , controlling , regulating , coordinating , monitoring , evaluating and carrying_out all cpec - related_activities . the authority of the cpec will also have the constitutional power to initiate any investigation or even impose_sanctions on any public_office_holder , including the prime_minister and president of pakistan , or those who are directly_or_indirectly involved in cpec - related_activities that willfully resist specified instructions , instructions or orders , Andani said adding , " even the powers of the prime_minister will be limited to what is specified in the cpec_authority bill 2020 . so he also will have to obey xi 's orders . " " the truth is that xi is plunging these countries into debt_traps

Allende was over thrown by a military_coup .   at_its_peak , the 1973 strikes involved more_than_250,000 truck_drivers , shopkeepers and professionals who banded to gether in a middleclass move ment that , many analysts have concluded , made a violent overthrow inevitable .   the times 's sources , while readily , acknowledging the intelligence_agency 's secret support for the middle_classes , insisted that the nixon administration 's goal had not been to force an end to the presidency of mr. Allende .   the sources noted that a request from the truckers union for more c.i.a. financial_aid in august , 1973 , one month before the coup , was rejected by the 40 committee , the intelligence review board headed_by secretary_of_state kissinger .   nonetheless , the sources

trump 's request of an ambassador : get the british open for me woody johnson , the n.f.l. owner , trump donor and ambassador to britain , was warned not to get involved in trying to move the tournament to a trump resort in scotland , but he raised the idea anyway   and he failed .   the american ambassador to britain , robert wood johnson iv , left , with president_trump and his_wife , melania , in 2018 in london .   london   the american ambassador to britain ,   , told multiple colleagues in february 2018 that president   had asked him to see if the british government could help steer the world - famous and lucrative british open golf tournament to the   , according to three people with knowledge of the episode .   the ambassador 's deputy , lewis a. Lukens , advised him not to do it , warning that it would be an unethical use of the presidency for private gain , these people said . but mr. johnson apparently felt pressured to try . a few_weeks later , he raised the idea of Turnberry playing host to the open with the secretary_of_state for scotland , david Mundell .   in a brief interview last_week , mr. Mundell said it was " inappropriate " for him to discuss his dealings_with mr. johnson and referred to a british government statement that said mr. johnson " made no request of mr. Mundell regarding the british open or_any_other sporting_event . " the statement did_not address whether the ambassador had broached the issue of Turnberry , which mr. trump bought in 2014 , but none of the next four opens are scheduled to be played there .   still , the episode left mr.

india must get ready for a tougher world india   which had a period of relative international security and benign climate   will today have to gear up for a more unstable environment and more hostility   narendra_modi too carried_forward this legacy , letting_go of the hurt that the us visa ban on him must have caused , introducing a new diplomatic style at madison square , getting barack_obama as chief_guest for republic day , and remaining invested in the relationship with donald_trump . ( getty_images )   for close to a decade - and - a - half , broadly between 2000 and 2015 , india was lucky in having a conducive international environment for its growth and ambitions . it was not just luck though . a series of indian leaders and bureaucrats ensured that the country was able to shape this international environment , within its limited powers , in its favour .   think back . the end of the 1990s , under the remarkably far - sighted leadership of atal_bihari_vajpayee , saw india conduct nuclear_tests . this invited international sanctions . but it also opened_the_doors for substantive dialogue with the international_community , particularly the united_states ( us ) , about the underlying logic of the relationship_between_the_two_countries . the Strobe talbot - jaswant_singh dialogue , bill_clinton 's visit to india , vajpayee calling india and the us natural partners , and the two countries moving_ahead with the next steps in the strategic_partnership , fundamentally altered the texture of the relationship . manmohan_singh ably took the baton , signing the defence framework_agreement and , of course , the nuclear_deal   over which he staked his government . narendra_modi too carried_forward this legacy , letting_go of the hurt that the us visa ban on him must have caused , introducing a new diplomatic style at madison square , getting barack_obama as chief_guest for republic day , and remaining invested in the relationship with donald_trump . the us , despite its differences with india , is now a steady partner .   but while this partnership has deepened , a lot else has changed .   in the early_2000s , under vajpayee and singh , there was an effort to engage with china productively . there was hope that a solution to the border_dispute could be found . india recognised chinese sensitivities on tibet ; china recognised india 's claim over sikkim . the economic linkages were deepening . the prevailing narrative was of china 's peaceful_rise , and a strong view emerged that the two countries could grow together . in the neighbourhood , even thoughtful diplomats argued that india and china could cooperate on projects . there was room for cooperation on global issues   from reform of international institutions to the climate_crisis . pm_modi too wished to

" the chinese have not shown any signs of de - escalation as they continue to maintain their heavy troop_deployment of almost 40,000 troops supported by heavy_weaponry like air_defence_systems , armoured_personnel_carriers and long - range artillery in front and depth_areas , " sources said .   comparison of indian_and_chinese_forces onground   even in a war with india , a significant_proportion of china forces will be unavailable , reserved either for russian taskings or for countering insurrection in xinjiang_and_tibet . the majority of forces are located further from the indian border , posing a striking contrast with the majority of forward - deployed indian forces with a single china defence mission .   china is regularly operating with a permanent indian conventional force advantage along its border_areas . in the event of a major standoff or conflict with india , it would have to rely_upon mobilization primarily from xinjiang and secondarily from the western_theater_command forces deeper in china 's interior . by contrast , indian forces are already largely in position .   comparison of indian and chinese air forces   the most significant people 's_liberation_army air_force ( plaaf)forward air_bases and airfields near indian border_areas are located at hotan , lhasa / Gonggar , ngari - gunsa , and Xigaze . each hosts regular plaaf detachments , and these are the nearest facilities to indian targets in kashmir , northern india , and northeast india . they are vulnerable to a dedicated indian offensive . ngari - gunsa and Xigaze reportedly have no hardened_shelters or blast pens for their aircraft , which sit in the open . an indian early initiative to destroy or incapacitate these four bases would compel china to rely more upon aircraft from its rear - area bases , exacerbating its limited fuel and payload problems .   other comparative weaknesses permeate the plaaf
for women in afghan_security_forces , a daily battle a new generation of women is moving to take up leadership_roles in afghanistan . the price is a daily barrage of abuse , and the fear that not much has changed .   khost , afghanistan   motivated , educated and fresh from finishing police academy in turkey , second lt . Zala Zazai had stellar qualifications for the job she took in eastern afghanistan in june . it all mattered little once she started .   on social_media , she was called a prostitute , and men wrote that her very presence on the force would corrupt khost_province , where she was posted . her colleagues at police headquarters   where she was the only female_officer on a staff   of nearly_500   tried to intimidate her into wearing a conservative head scarf and traditional clothes instead of her uniform , and to hide in back corners of the office away from the public , she said . shopkeepers arrived at the station 's gates with no other business but to get a look at this novelty .   lieutenant Zazai , 21 , came home from her first day feeling sick and frightened . she felt so unsafe that she asked her_mother , Spesalai , who had accompanied her from kabul , to stay with her at a shelter deep_inside police headquarters . at night , the two women locked_the_door . during the day , lieutenant Zazai scrambled to expedite the paperwork for a pistol .   lieutenant Zazai in her office at police headquarters in khost .

the genetics of bill_gates : treason , decapitation , exile , slavery , and hiding the links to israel the gates family line from 1300 ad to the present day   i enjoy researching family histories . i 'm always fascinated_by how genes express themselves from generation to generation . we are the same creatures as our_ancestors were . even_though we may have become healthier , more savvy , and live in a very different reality from our distant relatives , does_n't_mean we ca_n't learn anything from their journey . in fact , the process of researching your own family tree will often leave you feeling as though you 've been looking in a mirror . if you go_back far enough , you may even come across yourself .   on this occasion i was motivated by the many people who were researching   , also_known_as william h. gates iii . preliminary_investigations led me to the conclusion that no one had gone further back than 1806 but this was n't really the case . in reality , the family history was everywhere , but it was fractured and disconnected . it soon became_apparent that many researchers had missed some big connections and that others seemed to be purposely leading people in the wrong_direction . but the story of bill_gates genetic journey is full of both necessary misdirection and peculiar happenstance . it is a tale of kings and knights , treason and slaughter , exodus and colonialism , slavery and war , and one massive family .   the genetic history of bill_gates   we begin the story of bill_gates ' ancestry at the turn of the century in the year 1300 ad .   was born in essex and he is as far back in the gates family tree as i can trace . thomas would also name his son   , who was born in high easter , essex , in 1325 , but he would barely get a chance to know his heir . thomas gates senior would die two years after the birth of his son in 1327 . it was the same year in which the newly crowned   would lose against the scottish in the   . there_is_little_evidence of what did end the life of thomas gates but these were turbulent_times in english history , so there_are_many_ways in which a 27_year_old could meet their doom . the 1300 's is not the most fruitful time for public records but we can gather that the young thomas gates would father the first recorded william gates of the gates family ,   as we enter the 1400 's , we discover that the gates family is from fine stock . around 1401 , william f. gates welcomed his son   into the world . eventually

xi_jinping plans to take control of pakistan 's politics , economy through the cpec_authority : world news reports xi_jinping plans to take control of pakistan 's politics , economy through the cpec_authority : world news reports   over the years china has made several efforts to take full control of pakistan 's political and economic_affairs .   since 2016 , president_xi_jinping has pushed the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) and cpec authorities who will bring the country 's infrastructure_projects and power_plants under its direct control .   according to an article by ali_salman Andani published in the asia times , khan , a puppet of the military , can manipulate the law to fulfill xi 's desire to control pakistan 's planning ministry .   " i consider the ministry of planning , development_and_special_initiative of pakistan as one of the most_important state_institutions , whose senior_bureaucrats can implicitly examine and oppose the cruel cpec xi scheme , because they have access to all classified_documents in the agreement and are involved , directly_and_indirectly , in the decision_making_process , " Andani thought .   " as long as control is under the control of civil institutions led by representatives of the people and civil_servants , overall accountability for xi 's master_plan is at_least to a certain level and at a certain point of time   if not all at once   it is possible .   leaving_aside civil institutions altogether will allow xi to play on both_sides of the council , " he said .   Andani said , " xi does_not_want the belt_and_road_initiative or its components to be_held_responsible or face resistance .   he knew that china 's dream of indoctrination of the majority of free people in the world in 2050 would not be fulfilled if the people in the countries that were victims of bri knew about its strategy to destroy their future and their future_generations .   "   the cpec_authority will also have constitutional power to initiate investigations or even impose sentences on holders of public office , including the prime_minister and the president of pakistan , or those who directly_or_indirectly engage in activities related to cpec will intentionally reject directives , instructions or certain orders .   Andani said , adding , " even the prime_minister 's power will be limited to what is specified in the 2020 cpec_authority bill . so he must also obey xi 's orders . "   " the truth is that xi is weighing on these countries in the debt_trap while they are already_suffering_from an intense balance_of_payments_crisis .   xi will slowly poison pakistan and other poor economies by creating an_extreme_shortage of foreign_reserves .   in the end , these countries must accept the invasion of their political and economic system by the

letters from peking : what galwan_valley taught us this summer there are five major takeaways_from the ongoing_crisis in ladakh that will_inevitably shape india 's china policy significantly . the   is that xi_jinping 's china is at a stageand in a yearwhere it has simply ceased to care about global public_opinion or parameters of reasonable conduct . it has little interest in healthy relations with india and considers the diminishing of india 's role , growth , weight and presence as a key foreign_policy objective .   xi_jinping 's china is at a stageand in a yearwhere it has simply ceased to care about global public_opinion or parameters of reasonable conduct . it has little interest in healthy relations with india and considers the diminishing of india 's role , growth , weight and presence as a key foreign_policy objective .   from its blatant support of terrorist infrastructure directed against india to its defence of terror states , the chinese world view sees an india under_siege as necessary and useful for its_own strategic comfort . by seeking to grab territory by force , it has announced it considers india an adversary and will seek to harm it more directly . some in india can continue to sink their heads deeper in the sand and avoid reading the letter from beijing , but the message is clearthe " hu & wen " days of " partnership " , of an " asian_century for all " , of " brics for a better world " are pass . this is imperialism with_chinese_characteristics .   takeaway is that china is perfectly at ease with the coexistence of commerce and conflict , trade and war . it has perfected the ability of sleeping with its enemies and selling to them as well . beijing has successfully done so with the americans for decades . it has inveigled successive regimes in washington to underwrite and create the biggest geopolitical risk to a world order crafted by the us_and_its_allies . with this experience , china believes it can attack india , abuse indians and support violence against indian interests , all while conducting economic statecraft and everyday business . the chinese are smug in their belief that actions in ladakh will not hinder trade with india but may even win it negotiating space vis -- vis a diminished india . it is for new_delhi to puncture this notion .   beijing has successfully done so with the americans for decades . it has inveigled successive regimes in washington to underwrite and create the biggest geopolitical risk to a world order crafted by the us_and_its_allies   takeaway points to the chinese strategic ability to manipulate and game democratic societies . china creates dissent and discord through misinformation and propaganda . this summer , it has weaponised the openness of the

four chinese_companies in india may be sharing intel with pla ; centre traces links with chinese military by banning huawei , india has nothing to lose .   india has identified at_least four chinese_companies in india including huawei that have connections with the people 's_liberation_army ( pla ) and have been sharing crucial intel with it ,   according to the report , a 2017 chinese intelligence law empowers government authorities to conduct raid on suspects while companies_like_huawei , zte and tiktok provide intelligence for such raids . the companies are reportedly obliged to share information and cooperate_with chinese intel_agencies irrespective of where they operate from .   " any organisation or citizen shall support , assist and cooperate_with the state intelligence work in accordance_with_the_law . the state protects individuals_and_organisations that support , assist and cooperate_with national intelligence work , " article 7 of the law reads .   the four identified companies are -- Xindia steels , Xinxing cathay international group , china electronics technology group corporation ( CETC ) , and huawei .   the development comes_weeks_after indian government banned_59 china - based apps that could be potential_threat to nation 's security and data .   Xindia steels is a joint_venture_between india and china and has recently established an iron_ore pelletisation unit in karnataka .   Xinxing cathay international group , which is the main shareholder in Xindia steels , also has its_own manufacturing_plant in chhattisgarh .   while mobile_phone giant_huawei has large sales operations in india , the CETC is going to invest_$ 46 million in a 200 megawatt pv facility in andhra_pradesh .   it is worth_mentioning an interesting piece of information , that huawei 's founder ren Zhengfei was earlier a deputy_director of the pla 's engineering corps . the CETC too has been a major military electronics maker for the pla .
shock military defeat would end xi_jinping 's china dream expectations of chinese invulnerability have been built up to such a level that any setback would severely impact the credibility and hence support for the ccp regime .   looking fixedly at the rearview mirror is not the best way to go forward at speed , and the fixation with the past that lutyens lok exhibit in their policy_recommendations ( or in their resistance to necessary policies ) has already cost india dearly since_1947 . per_capita_income and other indicators of societal progress have been rising , but only from " catastrophically low " to " abysmally_low " . the characteristic of those steeped in the culture of the lutyens zone is to fasten themselves to whichever party and whoever leader is dominant at the period , discarding the old in the manner that lionesses forget an ageing lion that heads a pride who gets chased_away by a competitor . should another change occur , within days if not hours , they will be at the side of the new victors , making themselves appear indispensable , and causing the new masters to infuse into their government enough elements of the old so as to ensure_continuity in the policies that have kept much of the population of the country poorly compensated , inadequately educated and badly housed . it was said of some of the ruling families that they forgot nothing and learnt nothing , which is why tectonic shifts in global geopolitics were not taken advantage of within the policymakers congregated inside the lutyens zone . when the doors of the uk were open to commonwealth citizens and hundreds_of_thousands of those from pakistan or the caribbean were flooding britain , the incomprehensibly difficult path towards a right as fundamental as a passport ensured that far_fewer citizens of india could make that journey . much of the migration was from locations in africa , where some of the rulers destroyed their_own economies by expelling the indian community , sometimes with great cruelty , as in Idi amin 's uganda .   the national leadership of the world 's_most_populous_democracy , having failed to keep the subcontinent united when the british left , and after handing_over to a hostile country the strategically essential territory since known as pok , those in authority not merely welcomed but facilitated the pla 's conquest of tibet_in_1950 by standing by in silence , but by even feeding chinese_troops marching into tibet with grain from india 's less_than ample granaries . in the 1990s , when the ussr collapsed , india lost about $_9_billion ( in 1993 values ) by agreeing to an artificially high price for the russian rouble , the only country to make such a sacrifice . it is true that the ussr stood by india when the us and the uk joined_hands to

" ali , the pseudonym taylor gave him , would n't provide any more specifics , not even a name .

inside the china biotech_firm racing for a covid-19 vaccine t was the chinese philosopher sun_tzu , and not al Pacino in   , who first said , " keep your friends close , and your enemies closer . " yin weidong , the ceo of chinese biotech_firm sinovac , seems to have taken that advice to heart .   on the desk in his office in beijing are two plastic models of a viruseach blue core surrounded_by red protein spikes . from the time it started_spreading in the central_chinese_city_of_wuhan in late_december , containing that virus has occupied virtually every waking moment for the scientist .   the pandemic we now know as covid-19 is rampaging across every continent . on the dozens of daily infection charts , broken down by nation and pasted floor to ceiling on yin 's office wall , the numbers tell a horrifying story : 16 million infections and 640,000 deaths_worldwide , including 146,000 american lives_lost as of monday .   but if the enemy is close , so is a possible new friend . yin 's desk is now also home to several small glass vials of sinovac 's covid-19 vaccinedubbed CoronaVacthat began phase_3_trials involving 9,000 volunteers in brazil last_week . ( a phase_1 trial involves small_groups of patients to check a vaccine for negative side_effects , and a phase two trial usually tests for a combination of safety_and_efficacy , while a phase_3_trial is like a phase_2 but involving many more participants . )   " looking at the data_collected , i_think we have more_than an 80 % chance_of_success , " says yin .   normally , getting from pathogen identification through phase_3_trials in about 10 years is considered quick . the mumps vaccine is generally_considered the fastest ever developed at four years . but if_all_goes_well , CoronaVac might be ready for regulatory_approval early_next_year . not that yin is satisfied .   " do you_really_think this is fast ? compared with the spread_of_the_virus , it 's not fast enough , " he says , holding his plastic nemesis aloft with grudging respect . " that is how we should measure our progress . "   during the 2002 to 2003_sars outbreak , which claimed over 774 lives worldwide , sinovac was the only firm to go into phase_1 vaccine_trials , but the pandemic suddenly disappeared . that meant that research was discontinued at a huge_loss for the firm . it was n't entirely wasted , however . now , 17 years later , sinovac is able to build on that earlier work , given that covid-19 is very similar to sars . it and coronavirus are " like brothers , " says yin .   still , creating an_effective_vaccine is just a third of the battle . the other two prongs of vaccine_development are production_capacity and

" we speak more farsi than hebrew in ' tehran ' ... so to a certain_extent , i would like to think that it is an israeli - iranian series , although officially it is not , " he said .   Zonder told_afp he believes the iranian and israeli people " could be friends , without the leaders who frighten their population and stir_up hatred in order to stay in power " .   lead actress niv sultan studied farsi for four_months , he said , to prepare for the role of an iranian - born jewish woman who is sent back on an undercover mission to the country of her childhood .   two iranian - born actors are also in the show -- Navid Negahban and shaun Toub , both of whom have had roles in the us series " homeland " , which is also based on an israeli - made espionage series .   on a separate note , Zonder said that " placing a woman at the heart of this new action series was a political decision " .   " we wanted to see what a young , talented but inexperienced woman chooses and can do in a world ruled by men when her commanders have failed , " he said . " it is definitely a feminist series . "   its producers hope " tehran " will have similar global success as previous series featuring israel 's notorious secret agents .   " fauda " , about an undercover israeli unit fighting arab militants , marked a breakthrough for attracting international audiences to israeli productions and runs to three seasons on netflix .   praised by some for its nuanced portrayal of the israeli - palestinian_conflict , it has also been criticised for being one - sided and glorifying israel and its agents .

los_angeles : fbi investigation exposes chinese imperialism 's hand in city council corruption los_angeles : fbi investigation exposes chinese imperialism 's hand in city council corruption   a federal_investigation into the los_angeles city council has exposed collusion_between chinese developers and public officials and further corroborated the critical_role nonprofits play in gentrification .   the ongoing investigation goes far beyond 14   district city Councilmember jos Huizar ,   whose house was raided first by federal agents on november 7 , 2018   . other city council members , their aids , and their families are all being_investigated by the federal_bureau_of_investigation ( fbi ) for political corruption in big city - backed real_estate developments , according to a federal warrant made public last_week .   the warrant lists the crimes_committed by local government officials as bribery , kickbacks , conspiracy , money_laundering , extortion , racketeering , unethical conduct and lying about conflicts of interests . the warrant also names several imperialist chinese real_estate_developers .   Huizar , whose offices in boyle heights and downtown la were also raided , was the first member of the city council to be targeted by the fbi , but his corruption has been obvious for some time . he has faced allegations of discrimination and retaliation , and he has been the subject of at_least two lawsuits filed by former staffers for sexual_harassment (   , once in 2013 and again in 2018 ) .   during_his_tenure , Huizar 's district has seen rampant urban_development and multi - million_dollar gentrification projects .   the fbi investigation_has_revealed_that Huizar may have been receiving payouts in exchange for pushing particular development_projects and using his city - funded staff to fundraise for his_wife and her job at the private catholic Salesian high_school , his alma_mater .   in addition to overseeing a strategic district in la , Huizar 's rise to the head of the city council 's powerful planning and land use management committee gave him even more power and control over land development for the entire city .   the la masses are not blind to the corruption at city_hall , but the evidence pouring out in Huizar 's case is staggering even to the cynic .   jos Huizar , friend to chinese imperialism   Huizar has been a city council member since 2005   through four election cycles   and is set to end his last term in 2020 . over the years , he has amassed political power by playing_a_key_role in supporting major developments , especially with foreign_investors .   greenland usa , an imperialist chinese multi - billionaire real_estate_developer , was named in the federal warrant released last_week . greenland usa 's parent_company is greenland holdings group which is one of the richest real_estate_developers in

Ewers and Tabatabai rightly underline this as a " game_changer " , as if this plan comes to fruition , potentially aided by chinese money , it could weaponise the strait_of_hormuz significantly , and offer both iran and the arab_world an unchained playground for asymmetric_warfare and kinetic actions against one and other . for countries such as india , this eventuality would be a significant foreign and domestic policy challenge , as its top oil suppliers , critical to its economic story , are in the middle_east .

the last thing trump should do is push china as his country falters the last thing trump should do is push china as his country falters   by william jones source : global_times_published : 2020/7/26 16:38:53   us_president_donald_trump wears_a_mask as he visits walter_reed national military medical_center in bethesda , maryland on saturday . photo : vcg   with the enforced closure of the chinese_consulate general in houston and us state secretary mike_pompeo 's declaration at the richard_nixon presidential library in california that engagement with china , as we have known it , is now at an end , it is difficult to see how an era of cooperation between the us and china can be soon reestablished . obviously president_donald_trump , taking a hit in the polls , feels that taking a tough anti - china stance will help_him_win the next election , and so he is playing into the china - bashing strategy laid out by his secretary_of_state .   but there is a general rule that foreign_policy issues never play_a_major_role in presidential_elections , except during times of war or the threat of war . while there may be some who mistakenly believe that their loss of employment , the growing_poverty , and the spread of disease are somehow linked to china , the majority is simply fed_up_with the way washington works - or does_n't work . this was the issue that put president_trump in office in the first place - and now it is coming back to bite him .   while much of the civil uproar we_are_seeing in the streets of the us is fomented by a variety of radical_groups , the fact of the growing support for the demonstrations indicates a deep dissatisfaction within the electorate over where things are heading . the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the us can , to a great_extent , be attributed to the lackluster performance of trump , who only now with the resurgence of the virus finally donned a mask and encourages people to wear one in order to stem_the_spread of the disease . the early failure to rigorously invoke the defense_production_act in order to mandate production of the needed protective_gear is still felt in the lack of equipment and facilities to deal with the resurgence in places like texas and florida .   and the revival of the us economy , which president_trump so proudly announced as the major task of his presidency , has not even gotten to the drawing board . while the resurgence of covid-19 has hamstrung the hoped - for reopening of the economy , his much - touted infrastructure program has gone nowhere from day 1 , in spite of the fact that it would have garnered that much sought - after support from democrats in the house . and it 's not clear that

Baijnath aryan feels himachal is a rare state , which " even now has vastly unexplored treasures . " he recalls finding a fantastic wood carving of a lion , lying abandoned outside a temple in Kalpa , when he travelled in the region in the mid ' 80s . they were installed on the four corners of the temple roof , as guardians , but with time , had damaged and fallen .   " i would love to display my_father 's collection in himachal , but feel the authorities lack interest . the bronze masks and kangra paintings i have should be seen by Himachalis . i_am open to taking the exhibits to museums around the state , " said Baijnath , adding : " i sometimes worry_about the collection . i_am a mortal and the collection is too vast and valuable .

putin says russian navy to get hypersonic nuclear strike weapons putin says russian navy to get hypersonic nuclear strike weapons   moscow ( reuters ) - russian_president_vladimir_putin said on sunday the russian navy would be armed with hypersonic nuclear strike weapons and underwater nuclear drones , which the defence_ministry said were in their final_phase of testing .   putin , who says he does_not_want an arms_race , has often spoken of a new generation of russian nuclear_weapons that he says are unequalled and can hit almost anywhere_in_the_world . some western experts have questioned how advanced they are .   the weapons , some of which have yet to be deployed , include the poseidon underwater nuclear drone , designed to be carried by submarines , and the Tsirkon ( Zircon ) hypersonic cruise_missile , which can be deployed on surface_ships .   the combination of speed , manoeuvrability and altitude of hypersonic_missiles , capable of travelling at more_than five times the speed of sound , makes them difficult to track and intercept .   speaking in st_petersburg at an annual naval parade that showcases russia 's best ships , nuclear_submarines and naval aviation , putin said the navy 's capabilities were growing and it would get 40 new vessels this year .   he did_not_specify when it would receive new hypersonic_weapons , but suggested that day was drawing closer .   " the widespread deployment of advanced digital_technologies that have no equals in the world , including hypersonic strike systems and underwater drones , will give the fleet unique advantages and increased combat_capabilities , " putin said .   in a separate_statement released via russian news agencies , the defence_ministry said testing of the Belgorod , the first submarine capable_of_carrying the poseidon drones , was underway and testing of the weapons_systems was nearing_completion .   " work is being successfully_completed to create modern_weapons systems for the navy , " it was cited as saying .   putin last_year threatened to deploy hypersonic_missiles on ships_and_submarines that could lurk outside u.s. territorial_waters if the united_states moved to deploy intermediate - range nuclear_weapons in europe .   washington has not deployed such missiles in europe , but moscow is worried it might .

efforts for grand step_forward islamabad : two most_important persons including prime_minister_imran_khan are considering to address much of the political and economic chaos that has troubled the first two years of the pti_government and has impacted the confidence , directly_and_indirectly , of the local and international business_community and investors .   an informed source termed the move as a " grand step_forward " being worked out by engaging all key_stakeholders . reformation of the accountability_process through consensus amendments in the nab law is one of the major challenges to be met for the achievement of main_objective   political and economic_stability .   the source said that there are three things on the table for discussion and settlement . first is the enactment of a new nab law in line with the ordinance that the pti had passed last_year but lapsed after_completing its constitutional four_months period . the focus of these amendments will be to continue with the accountability_process by carving_out those provisions which have been massively misused and abused by the nab and have created_an_atmosphere of harassment and injustice and because of which businessmen and bureaucracy in particular have stopped_working .   second challenge is the enactment of fatf_related 14 bills by the parliament . three of these bills have_already_been passed , one is left with the senate and 10 are at the stages of commitments .   the source said that all these bills , when enacted , will help put the country on track with regards to the financial commitments of international_organisations , making our financial system transparent and harder to manoeuvre for money_laundering etc . this will also take away the dark shadow of being boycotted by the international system that india has been trying hard against pakistan .   third challenge is the nfc_award , which is being worked around so that the burden of debt or defence could be shared with the provinces . according to the source , it is aimed to be done in a manner either without touching the 18th_amendment or if required with fewer changes . it will_be_ensured to solve the federal_government 's concern on the matter without creating political chaos .   " combined the three , the package deal has the potential to address much of the political and economical chaos that has troubled the government 's first two years and that has impacted the confidence directly_and_indirectly of the local and international business_community and investors , " the source said .   the source , however , feared that there are still many spoilers within the system and outside who are trying to derail this progress . the source added that it will be a test of nerves for pm_imran_khan to keep the delicate process steady and stable so that all three goals can_be_achieved without ego , politics and petty rivalry coming

" nationwide condemnation of the incident is natural . government should take_strict_action . "   government and senior_police_officials were not_immediately_available_for_comment .   the eviction was part of a drive to stop encroachment on land and the area the couple was farming had been allotted for the construction of a college , said a policeman who_declined_to_be_named as he was not authorised to talk to the media .   six police_officers were suspended on thursday and the state government has ordered_an_investigation_into the incident .   india banned discrimination_based on caste   a system which divided hindus into groups based on occupations   in 1955 . but centuries - old biases against lower - caste groups persist , making_it_harder for them to access education , jobs and homes .   a growing_population and rising pressure on land to build homes , highways and industry is triggering conflicts , with lower - caste citizens often facing eviction , particularly in rural_areas where biases are most entrenched , campaigners say .   more_than_half of india 's lower - caste population is landless , according to census_data . several states have laws aimed_at giving land to dalits but few have produced results , according to dalit activists and leaders .

a troubling pandemic thought : are these the good_old_days ? hope valley , r.i. ( ap )   news_articles do_n't carry hollywood - style viewer ratings or trigger warnings . maybe this one should .   but consider this : what if these are the good_old_days ?   depressing as that might_seem after the coronavirus_pandemic has claimed well over 630,000 lives worldwide , cost tens_of_millions their jobs and inflicted untold misery across the planet , it 's entirely possible   increasingly likely , some say   that things will get_worse before they get better .   americans in particular have been optimists by nature for the better part of four centuries . but even here , a bleak dystopian vision is emerging in some corners . it 's not pretty .   it imagines a not - too - distant_future where we 'll all look back with nostalgia at 2020 as a time when most of us had plenty of food and wine , could get many of the goods_and_services we needed , and could work_from_home at jobs that still paid us .   " this could be as good as it gets , so let 's take pleasure in what we have now , " katherine Tallman , the ceo of the Coolidge corner theatre , an indie cinema in Brookline , massachusetts , told a recent zoom roundtable .   continues to buffet the planet economically   , dashing hopes that the worst of the joblessness might be behind us .   for 18 consecutive weeks now , more_than a million americans have sought unemployment_benefits . new infections have been surging in states like florida and california that power the economy , threatening people 's health and livelihoods for the foreseeable_future .   that 's bad . but in online_forums and on social_media , futurists see the potential for worse . much_worse . their musings are n't for the faint of heart .   it 's likely that few , if any , of their forecasts will come to pass . this time next year , we may well marvel at how swiftly this existential_threat was vanquished . but with the numbers going in the wrong_direction , and collective confidence badly shaken , those given to ruinous thoughts can be_forgiven for thinking the worst :   what if humanity 's frantic_efforts to produce a viable vaccine take longer than envisioned , allowing the virus to kill indiscriminately in the interim ?   what if that coincides_with a climate calamity that ruins crops and shatters supply_chains , stripping supermarket shelves bare of much more_than hand_sanitizer and toilet_paper ?   for all our kvetching about masks , could we one day find_ourselves having to don hazmat_suits just to leave the house ?

" the only solution as the world has discovered is a smart_lockdown , which allows_for_economic_activity_with_sops . we are amongst the pioneers_of_this_approach , " the prime_minister said on twitter .   in its latest study , imperial_college of london ranked pakistan at fourth for coronavirus reproduction in the country based on july 20 data . pakistan has achieved 0.73 rate , while the countries getting below 1 rating are considered the best for their anti - covid efforts .   interestingly , the countries_including_germany and portugal , which rank above pakistan , are also advocating the very concept_of_smart_lockdown to prevent a new surge_in_infections . besides the administrative_measures to ensure_strict closure of hotspots , the prime_minister repeatedly addressed the nation advising them for strict_precautions to avert the disaster .   however , now as the results show that the measure works , many developing_nations are also promoting the policy . germany , italy , and portugal are also discussing urban shutdowns to avert a new increase in infections of coronavirus .   more and more countries are closing_down smaller territories , as opposed to shutting_down the whole country . bangladesh - based the business_standard lauded the prime_minister 's smart_lockdown_approach despite fierce_opposition .   the rationale_behind the smart_lockdown was to protect the country , particularly the daily_wagers , from the worst economic scenario in a country where millions already live_below_the_poverty_line .   with_the_passage_of_time , not merely the countries but the international_organizations , joined the prime_minister 's call for balancing between_lives_and_livelihood to avert massive_layoffs and consequent deaths due to hunger . by the end of the year , 12,000 people per day could die_from_hunger linked to covid-19 , potentially more_than will die from the disease itself .   this is more_than the peak global coronavirus death_rate of 10,000 per day in april , according to oxfam , an international confederation of 20 ngos_working in over 90 countries against injustices causing poverty .   new hunger hotspots are also emerging . middle - income countries such as india , south_africa , and brazil are experiencing rapidly_rising levels of hunger as millions of people that were just about managing have been

what the a.d.a. means to me photo_illustration by jon key ; 506 collection / alamy ( photograph )   we should celebrate . but there is still work to do .   this essay is based on an_interview of judy Heumann by Kaitlyn wells . ms. Heumann is the co - author of   " being Heumann : an Unrepentant memoir of a disability rights_activist , "   and is featured in the award - winning netflix documentary "   Crip camp : a disability revolution . "   i was 18 months old when my parents learned i had polio . it was 1949 , and things that were typical for children were not so typical for me . i was denied the right to go to school because the staff did_not_know how to accommodate a student who could not walk . instead , i received just two - and - a - half_hours of home instruction each week . people like me who did_not fit into a neat little box had no laws to protect them . we were not advancing in our education and no one had expectations for our futures .   this discrimination continued when i pursued my teaching career . though i passed all my exams , i was denied a teaching license in 1970 because new_york_city 's board of education thought i could not safely evacuate my students in case of a fire . there_was_no one who looked_like me   who used a wheelchair   fighting for this right . i   i began to see other disabled people fighting for inclusion , and i found empowerment in our collaboration . on april 5 , 1977 , more_than_a_hundred of us occupied a san_francisco federal building for what became_known_as the 504 sit - in . we had fought with the carter administration to sign regulations implementing section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 , which prohibited programs that received federal funding from discriminating_against disabled people , but after years of asking , 504 still had not been signed . we occupied the building for almost a month until our demands_were_met . section 504 was key because it laid_the_foundation for the americans with_disabilities act .   the a.d.a. helped open building doors , allowed us to earn an education and made it illegal to discriminate_against a qualified_person for employment . we should celebrate the strides we have made . but there is still work to do . the way society thinks about disability needs to evolve , as too many people view disability as something to loathe or fear . by changing this mentality , by recognizing how disabled people enrich our communities , we can all be empowered to make_sure disabled people are included .   photo_illustration by jon key ;

human_rights_groups : fashion_brands using chinese slave cotton 180 + human_rights_groups : world fashion_brands using chinese slave - harvested cotton   nearly_200 global human_rights and labor groups launched_a_campaign thursday demanding companies stop profiting from china 's enslaved ethnic_minorities , noting that " virtually the entire apparel industry is tainted by forced uyghur and turkic muslim labour . "   the group , calling itself the   coalition to end forced_labour in the uyghur region   , pointed_out_that over 80_percent of the cotton used to make clothing and other fabrics in china was picked in xinjiang , making it extremely likely to have been picked by uyghur slaves .   an estimated 84_percent of cotton in china grows in its western xinjiang_uyghur_autonomous_region   about 20 percent of the cotton in the world , the coalition noted on its site .   " almost every major apparel brand and retailer selling cotton products is potentially implicated , " the coalition asserted . " right now , there is near certainty that any brand sourcing apparel , textiles , yarn or cotton from the uyghur region is profiting from human_rights_violations , including forced_labour , both in the uyghur region and more_broadly throughout china . "   " brands continue to source millions of tons ofcotton and yarn from the uyghur region . roughly 1 in 5 cotton garments sold globally contains [ sic ] cotton and/or yarn from the uyghur region ; it is virtually certain that many of these goods are tainted with forced_labour , " the coalition said in a statement debuting its campaign . " moreover , apparel brands maintainlucrative partnershipswith chinese corporations implicated in forced_labour , including those that benefit from theforced labour transferof victims from the uyghur region to work in factories across china . "   the group is demanding that every company with ties to china " exit the uyghur region at every level of their supply_chain , from cotton to finished_products , to prevent the use of forced_labour of uyghurs_and_other groups in other facilities , and to end relationships with suppliers supporting the forced_labour system . " they are demanding companies reach this goal in 12 months .   exiting the uyghur slave_trade means not just ending operations in xinjiang , but cutting_ties to any chinese company or facility that itself has ties to xinjiang , even if the facilities the companies use are not there . it adds that companies have " no credible explanation " for how they can do business in china without profiting from slavery .   among the organizations joining the coalition are dozens of uyghur advocacy_groups around the world . joining them , however , are a wide_variety of organizations like tibetan and hong_kong solidarity groups and human_rights ngos like human_rights_watch . unions like the afl - cio and

( Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi / ap )   facing_mounting allegations_of_corruption and planned_protests next_week , zimbabwe 's government stepped_up a recent string of arrests of its critics , detaining the country 's most prominent investigative_journalist and an opposition activist .   at_least eight state agents monday stormed the residence of Hopewell chin'ono , the journalist who had recently exposed a corruption_scandal in the health_ministry . he had used social_media to echo a call by activist jacob Ngarivhume for protests next_week against corruption .   both were charged monday with incitement_to_violence , according to a statement from police . a government spokesman , nick Mangwana , said on twitter that " no profession [ is ] above the law " regarding the arrest of chin'ono .   on tuesday , the government announced that it would impose a   infections . critics linked the move to the planned_protests .   chin'ono 's reporting has repeatedly dogged the government for corruption , which   says costs the country more_than $_2_billion every year . his investigation led to the   of health minister Obadiah moyo earlier_this_month for awarding_contracts for pandemic - related protective_gear at inflated costs .   one year after mugabe 's historic ouster , zimbabwe looks much the same   in a separate case , former tourism minister Prisca Mupfumira goes on trial next_week for charges that he used millions_of_dollars from the state pension_fund for personal purposes .   zimbabwe is led by emmerson mnangagwa , a former minister and enforcer under robert mugabe , who ruled the country with an increasingly authoritarian style for nearly_40_years . mnangagwa was declared_the_winner of elections two years_ago that the   and has yet to accept .

" Hopewell in particular has been at the forefront of exposing that , and jacob is at the forefront of advocating protests against it . that 's what this is about . this is effectively an insecure regime trying to block the voices of those who want to help citizens understand the connections between corruption and their suffering . "   western embassies and human_rights_groups issued calls for their swift release but Coltart said he thought it was more likely , given recent precedent after the arrest of other government critics , that bail would be denied and chin'ono and Ngarivhume would be held past the planned_protests

homeland_security dept . admits making_false statements in fight with n.y. the surprise admission came as the trump_administration unexpectedly reversed its decision to bar new_yorkers from programs that allow travelers to speed through airports .   travelers who have enrolled in the global entry program provide information to the authorities ahead of time and can then use kiosks at international_airports .   paul j. richards / agence_france - presse   getty_images   homeland_security officials made false_statements in a bid to justify expelling new_york residents from programs that let united_states travelers speed through borders and airport lines , federal lawyers admitted on thursday .   the unusual admission , contained in a court filing , said the inaccuracies " undermine a central argument " in the trump_administration 's case for barring new_yorkers from the programs after the state passed a law enabling undocumented_immigrants to get driver 's licenses .   the filing was a surprising retreat by the administration in its continuing battle with democratic - led states and cities over immigration_policy .   federal officials had previously insisted that new_york was an_outlier in the restrictions it placed on the access the immigration_authorities have to state_department of motor_vehicles records .   for that reason , they argued , new_york was endangering_national_security and could_not_be trusted to participate in global entry and related programs .   but in their filing on thursday , the government lawyers acknowledged that several other states , washington , d.c. , and some u.s. territories also limited access to motor_vehicle information and had not been subject to similar clampdowns .   against that backdrop , the filing said , " the acting secretary of homeland_security has decided_to_restore new_york residents ' access to " what is officially_known_as the trusted traveler program " effective_immediately . "   the court filing on thursday came in response to lawsuits filed by new_york state and the new_york civil_liberties_union over the decision to kick new_yorkers out of the programs .   " defendants deeply_regret the foregoing inaccurate or misleading_statements and apologize to the court and plaintiffs for the need to make these corrections at this late_stage in the litigation , " said audrey strauss , the acting united_states_attorney in manhattan .   a spokesman for the united_states_attorney 's office declined further comment .   in their_own filing , justice department lawyers for the homeland_security department echoed ms. strauss 's letter nearly word for word , asking the court to " accept this notice to correct the record , and permit defendants to withdraw the aforementioned arguments . "   Letitia james , new_york 's attorney_general , welcomed the department 's decision to reverse_course , saying the state 's lawsuit had been focused on " stopping the president 's irrational , arbitrary and retaliatory rule .

zhou_rong : what do 3 g , 4_g_services mean to far - flung areas of pakistan ? by : zhou_rong   source : china_economic_net   published : 2020 - 07 - 20   beijing , july 20 ( china_economic_net ) - pakistani federal_minister_for_information_technology and telecommunication syed_aminul_haque has announced that 3_g_and_4_g_services will be provided soon to far - flung areas of balochistan , khyber - pakhtunkhwa and gilgit - baltistan .   right now the government of pakistan was committed_to_promoting the countrys technological capacity to develop a globally_competitive it sector and industry . as the minister put it , the project would meet the objective of providing infrastructure in order_to_ensure access and connectivity for people , provide broadband_services to the locals , improve their life standard , create_job_opportunities , empower_women and so on .   some people might not understand_why the project may help pakistani women a lot . we know that the phenomenon of male superiority still_exists in pakistan . although there have been a large_number of female military people , female medical_workers , female_journalists , female judicial workers , female scholars , and policewomen in pakistan , women are still not encouraged to appear in public_places .   however , online work driven by 3_g_and_4_g can prevent women from contacting people face_to_face in public . relatively speaking , for pakistan , womens participation in online employment is and will be more acceptable . the federal_government now decided to subsidy rs_650 million , and about two million people may benefit from it . to a certain_degree , it has successfully removed pay - wall restriction on coverage of covid-19 .   but popularizing 3_g_and_4_g in pakistan has never been an easy_job . take online class as an example . on march_13 , pakistan announced the closure_of_all_educational_institutions following the outbreak of covid-19 in the country . the federal_and_provincial_governments encouraged online_classes long_ago , but it was very_difficult to implement . many areas in balochistan are not equipped with fiber_optic lines . nine out of 32 districts are completely without mobile_internet_services , as the internet was shut_down due_to_security_reasons . since then all classrooms have remained_shut , prompting a huge crisis in the education_sector at_all_levels . pakistani_authorities have ordered universities to make classes_online only to help curb_the_spread of the virus , but the quality_of_education to certain_degree declined .   online_classes are nothing without internet . if the government is concerned about the future of pakistans education , it has to restore the internet in rural_areas . mobile_internet_services were shut_down in the tribal_region . its not only the students that are suffering due to a lack of mobile_internet_services in former_fata . there are many expats living in the middle_east . they need to communicate with their families and wire money . in remote_areas , the internet signal is poor as the service is available intermittently , and

what_happens_when_you 're disabled but nobody can tell the author and clinical_psychologist andrew solomon examines the disabilities that ramps and designated parking spots do_n't address .   such social insensitivity is endemic to the lives of people with permanent but invisible disabilities that affect their daily functioning , who are likewise deprived of outer symbols to signal their condition .   the word " disability " evokes images of ramps , lower - positioned urinals , grab bars and other allowances in our architectural landscape . but an_untold_number of people have disabilities   from a.d.h.d. to addictive disorder to lupus   that are n't_necessarily helped by a designated parking spot . a person who walks with a limp but uses no physical support may be jostled on the street like anyone_else . an autistic person , or a person with a mental_illness , will often be disdained or   for peculiar or antisocial behavior .   invisible disabilities can be easier in some ways than physically evident ones , but they can , equally , be more difficult . they have the advantages and disadvantages of secrecy .   the americans with_disabilities act ( a.d.a. )   , which marks its 30th_anniversary this month , requires employers , businesses , public facilities , transportation and telecommunications to make accommodations for a disabled person whose physical_or_mental impairment interferes with one or more major life activities . while accommodating people with invisible disabilities is mandated by law , what specifically constitutes a disability is opaque , and what_constitutes accommodation is just as vague . for many people , the a.d.a. is a broad , blunt tool that does_not always serve their specific needs .   ( c.d.r. ) lists the following invisible disabilities : " learning differences , deafness , autism , prosthetics , traumatic brain injury ( t.b.i. ) , mental_health disabilities , usher syndrome , bipolar disorder , diabetes , a.d.d./a.d.h.d. , fibromyalgia , arthritis , alzheimer 's , anxiety , sleep disorder , Crohn 's disease , and many more . " post - traumatic stress disorder , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis are other invisible disabilities . the c.d.r. cautions , " unless it is disclosed , no_one_knows for sure whether someone has an invisible disability . "   because of the issue of disclosure , there_is_no way to track the number of people with such disabilities . there are rough approximations of the number of people with , for example , lupus or cystic fibrosis , but some of those people may view themselves as substantially disabled while others may not . according_to_one_estimate from the   , about a billion people worldwide are disabled . of the 61_million adults in the united_states with a disability , a   found , only around 6 percent

pompeo criticizes ' totalitarian ' china as tensions_escalate speech at nixon library meant to show engagement 's failure   pompeo_speaks day after ordering houston consulate closing   watch : secretary_of_state_michael_pompeo cast china 's leaders as tyrants bent on global_hegemony as tensions_between the world 's two biggest_economies rise .   secretary_of_state_michael_pompeo cast china 's leaders as tyrants bent on global_hegemony , painting a dark portrait of the country 's direction as tensions soar between the world 's two biggest_economies .   president_xi_jinping " is n't destined to tyrannize inside_and_outside china forever unless we allow it , " pompeo said thursday at the richard_nixon presidential library in Yorba linda , california . " securing our freedoms from the chinese_communist_party is the mission of our time . "   pompeo cast competition with china as an_existential struggle between right and wrong , hearkening back to the language of the u.s.-soviet standoff during the cold_war . his remarks , at the site dedicated to the president who helped open u.s.-china ties half_a_century ago , were the culmination of a series of speeches by top administration officials about the threat from china .   " if we bend the knee now , our children 's children may be at the mercy of the chinese_communist_party , whose actions are the primary challenge today in the free world , " he said . " the free world must triumph over this new tyranny . "   ' china model ' aims for prosperity without democracy :   the speech came_a_day_after the u.s. unexpectedly ordered china to close its consulate_in_houston within_72_hours , following what it said were years of espionage directed from the diplomatic compound against u.s. commercial and national_security assets . china hit back on friday , announcing the   of the american consulate in the southwestern_city of chengdu and dismissing pompeo 's speech as " a mix - and - match of senior u.s. officials ' recent political lies about china . "   foreign_ministry_spokesman_wang_wenbin told a regular news_briefing in beijing that china had no interest in hegemony and blamed u.s. officials for " fanning confrontation " between_the_two_countries . " we have no intention to change the u.s. and the u.s. ca_n't change china , " wang said .   pompeo 's speech was built off a conviction widely_held within the trump_administration and its allies in congress , that u.s. efforts to bind china to the international system and accommodate its rise since the nixon era have failed , and that it 's time for a much_tougher approach . while pompeo did_n't call for regime_change , he came close , saying the u.s. must " engage and empower the chinese people .

Javion Vakhabov told about his government immense desire to explore all possible means to make the important rail_project a reality . a historic noteworthy dimension of the project is that the city of Mazare sharif in afghanistan and city of peshawar in pakistan will also be an_integral_part of this project . it merits mention that traders of peshawar used to do barter trade through afghanistan with their counterparts in uzbekistan during Mugual dynasty era of india . there was also a reasonable quantum of bilateral_trade through the open_ended exchange_rate mechanism of free convertibility of national currencies .   pakistan- central_asia connectivity is not only vital for economic_prosperity of the region but also for caucasian countries , middle_east_and_north_africa . the participation of ambassadors of afghanistan Roya rehmani , us_special_representative on Afghainstan zalmay Khalildad and envoy of kazakhstan Erzhan Kazikanov points to the bright prospect of this future scenario . Tarmez to Gawdarrial link project seems to be a harbinger of bringing prosperity to the people of this region .   people of pakistan and of course business_community as well had express joy and jubilation when six central_asian_states became independent . they were aspiring to restore the broken links of trade , cultural_exchange and visits to the cities of Bukhara , samarkand and tashkent in uzbekistan , which had remained the seats of learning and ancient civilization . the city of Bukhara has a special reverence for the people of pakistan . the compiler of the most authentic hadith book " Sahih - al bukhari , imam Muhaammad ibn ismail al - bukhari was born in Bukhara in 196 hijra ( 810 ad ) .   since 1991 central_asia opening has been a cherished dream for the people_from_all_walks_of_life in pakistan . renowned economists and trade leaders had always given valuable_input how for establishing trade_relations central_asian_countries and giving impetus to it . in the first pml - n government , economic_affairs minister sardar asif ahmad ali arranged seminars in the capital cities of all_four_provinces on the importance of economic_integration with central_asia and had led trade delegation to central_asian_states , but tangible_results did_not_follow .   launching of china_pakistan_economic_corridor ( cpec ) revived the expectation of central_asia opening . it was primarily a connectivity project , which the previous government tilted towards mainly an energy_generation project .

pakistan mulling_over reconsidering cpec : financial times deals that are giving illegal benefits to the chinese_companies need to be_revisited and made anew , abdul_razzaq_dawood said , as pakistani companies are at a disadvantage   karachi : pakistan is mulling_over a review of the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) agreementwith china , international economic magazine   on sunday , citing islamabad 's unease with what it claims is unjust benefit being enjoyed by beijing - origin companies .   according to the ft 's claim , chinese_foreign_minister_wang_yi , who was in pakistan over the weekend , indicatedhis country 's willingness to have discussions pertaining to the cpec again . in_this_regard , options to extend the loan_repayment period , among other plans , are being pondered upon .   renowned_economist abdul_razak_dawood , who is also the advisor to prime_minister_imran_khan on commerce , textiles , industries production and investment , is of the view that for the time being , all cpec - related_projects must be halted for at_least a year . deals that are giving illegal benefits to the chinese_companies need to be_revisited and made anew , he added , since pakistani companies are at a disadvantage .   " the previous government did a bad job negotiating with china on cpec   they did_n't do their homework correctly and did_n't negotiate correctly so they gave away a lot , " dawood noted , as per the ft .   " i_think we should put everything on hold for a year so we can get our act together . perhaps we can stretch cpec out over another five_years or so , " he added .   however , michael_kugelman , the deputy_director of theWilson center 's asia_program , commented that slowing_down the cpec would be a major change against the policies of the former_prime_minister_nawaz_sharif - led government .   " a decision to slow_down the # cpec process would be a major change from the previous government 's policy , " kugelman , a specialist on south_asian_countries ' relations with the us , tweeted .   several ministers_and_advisers , according to the ft , believe that the government should review cpec - led investments in order to renegotiate the trade_deal since it has unjustly benefitted the chinese_companies .   " chinese_companies received tax_breaks , many breaks and have an undue_advantage in pakistan ; this is one of the things we 're_looking_at because it 's not fair that pakistan companies should be disadvantaged , " he told the ft .   pakistani economists and officials agree that it was a better option to pause and spread cpec_projects over a lengthier time period , instead of ditching the deal altogether   something that may attract anger from beijing .   finance ministerAsad umar , on_the_other_hand , said islamabad

turkey deports uighur_muslims back to china via third countries : reports , world news turkey deports uighur_muslims back to china via third countries : reports   according to a report of the telegraph , turkey is helping china repatriate uighur_muslims by sending them to third countries from which they can be_extradited by beijing .   chinese government has already attracted widespread_criticism for its treatment_of_uighurs in the northwest region of xinjiang , where up to one million members of mostly muslim turkic - speaking minority_groups are held in internment_camps .   china 's government considers many members of the uighur ethnic_minority to be " terrorists " and " separatists . " it has imprisoned them on a mass_scale and has turned xinjiang into one of the world 's most tightly_controlled police states .   according to a report of the telegraph , turkey is helping china repatriate uighur_muslims by sending them to third countries from which they can be_extradited by beijing . the telegraph documented several cases in which turkey had sent uighurs to countries like tajikistan , where it is easier for china to secure their extradition .   china has stridently maintained that uighurs and xinjiang affairs are its internal_matter . china is taking extreme measures to silence anyone who speaks out against its government .   reports leaked last_month suggested that china detained muslim_minority uighurs for beards , wearing veils , visiting foreign countries and having " too many " children .   uighurs ' birth_rates have dropped by more_than_60 per_cent from 2015 to 2018 . across the xinjiang_region , birth_rates fell 24 per_cent last_year as compared to just 4 per_cent in the rest of the country .   beijing has maintained that vocational_training being carried is meant to help stamp out islamist_extremism and separatism and to teach locals new skills .   donald_trump 's ' concession speech ' on jimmy fallon goes_viral
chinese media : killer flood_waters are like ' naughty kids ' chinese_state_media : killer flood_waters are like ' naughty kids who want to go out and play '   chinese_state_media is taking some heat   even from within the tightly - controlled chinese internet   for minimizing the danger of a flood disaster that has already ruined millions of lives , and threatens to unleash an unprecedented humanitarian_catastrophe if the massive three_gorges hydroelectric dam fails .   a social_media post from the state - run xinhua_news_agency on wednesday compared the killer floodwaters to " naughty kids who want to go out and play . "   a chinese user on the wechat social_media_platform slamming xinhua for using its_own wechat account to trivialize the danger from the floods .   " it 's a shame for the media to portray disasters in an amusing way , " the critical user said , referring to a xinhua post that tried to anthropomorphize this season 's once - in - a - century floods by imagining the spirits of nature as bratty children on a mischievous rampage . the xinhua post was reportedly pulled down after the backlash .   residents of the yangtze_river region are bracing for another round of floods as the chinese government estimates damage from the 2020 monsoon_season is approaching $_23_billion . 93 of the yangtze 's tributaries have flooded and the great central river itself is threatening to surge against the three_gorges_dam , which is the last line of defense for millions of people and billions_of_dollars in assets .   the yangtze_river is asia 's largest at 3,900 miles in length and is a   of water and hydroelectric_power for an immense population . the region has hundreds of large and small_dams , plus thousands of reservoirs to handle heavy_rains , but the current_monsoon_season has overwhelmed the entire system . the water level in the three_gorges reservoir reached a record_high last_week , cresting just a little over ten meters below the 175 - meter maximum rated height for the dam .   on thursday that chinese citizens suffering through the floods are increasingly exasperated with dictator_xi_jinping 's refusal to visit the area and with their state media 's reluctance to show the full_extent of the damage , so they are uploading their_own videos that show cities wiped_out , homes_destroyed , and priceless historic monuments submerged underwater .   , the chinese people are growing increasingly suspicious that their rulers are not being honest with them about the danger to the three_gorges_dam . several alarming discharges involving " huge streams " of floodwater have been seen at the facility , despite_assurances that all operations are proceeding normally . three_gorges officials are making the first public admissions that the dam has suffered structural displacement and deformation , although they

Dahlia Lithwick : when we started this project , i_think we thought the nine women in your class would clump together and be like a pack . i was remembering when i started at stanford law school , in 1992 , that 's kind of how it was . but based on my conversations with your classmates , it does_n't_seem like that necessarily organically happened .   well for me , i had no time to waste , because jane was 14 months when i started . so my time was used very efficiently , for classes , for studying after class , then come home at 4_p.m. to take care of jane . i did_n't have time for any socializing , except on weekends . so the only person among the women , for a time , that i was close to was Jinnie davis . and that continued after law school .   read about Jinnie 's life , and her memories of justice ginsburg   she was in my section , and she was just a lovely person . she was a christian scientist . when marty had cancer his third year , our second year , she visited him in the hospital a few times , and i was

sc spots bias in nab handling of political case sc spots bias in nab handling of political case   " the bureau_seems_reluctant_in_proceeding_against people on one_side_of_the_political_divide , " says supreme_court_verdict .   afp / file   detailed_verdict assails antigraft watchdog 's conduct in dealing_with paragon_housing case   justice_baqar says it is frequently alleged the bureau is flagrantly used_for_political_engineering   judge regrets pygmies selected , nurtured , promoted and brought to power   islamabad : the supreme_court on monday described the national_accountability_bureau 's ( nab ) conduct in dealing_with the paragon_housing_society corruption_case as a clear_manifestation of utter_disregard to the law , fair_play , equity_and_propriety .   " the present case is a classic_example of trampling_of_fundamental_rights , unlawful deprivation of freedom , and liberty and the complete_disregard for human_dignity as guaranteed_by_the_constitution , " wrote justice_maqbool_baqar in an 87 - page strongly_worded detailed_verdict in the paragon_city ( pvt ) ltd case .   former railways_minister and pml - n stalwart khawaja_saad_rafique_and_his_brother khawaja suleman rafique were   in the case on march 17 this year after they deposited surety_bonds of rs3_million each .   justice_baqar had headed a two - judge_bench which took up the post - arrest bail_plea of the khawaja_brothers against the rejection of their bail by the lahore_high_court on june_18 last_year .   in the verdict , justice_baqar regretted that it was frequently alleged that nab was being flagrantly used_for_political_engineering and that the bureau 's discriminatory approach was also affecting its image and had shaken the faith of people in its credibility and impartiality .   " the bureau_seems_reluctant_in_proceeding_against people on one_side_of_the_political_divide even in respect of financial_scams of massive proportion while those on the other side are being arrested and incarcerated for months and years without_providing_any sufficient cause even when the law mandates investigations to be concluded_expeditiously and trial to be concluded within_30_days , " he said in the verdict .   " nonetheless , investigation is often not concluded for months and cases remain_pending for years . it is because of lack_of_professionalism , expertise and sincerity of cause that the conviction_rate in nab cases is abysmally_low . the above is certainly not serving the national interest , rather causing irretrievable harm to the country , nation and society in multiple_ways , " he regretted .   justice_baqar_observed that though curbing loot_and_plunder and combating corruption were a noble_cause , the means , process and mechanism employed should be within_the_parameters of law .   the arrest of a person , the judgement explained , was a grave matter , but the capricious exercise of the power to arrest had deleterious consequences and , therefore , needed to be exercised with care , caution and sensitivity . " arrest of a person has to be justified not only by referring to prima_facie evidence and adequate actionable material sufficiently connecting
our betrayal of tibet will keep haunting us an unsung_hero of the caribbean : dr. jung bahadur_singh of guyana   mahakali murti found broken in 900 - year - old , Hoysala - era lakshmi temple : hassan , karnataka   repeated suspension of true Indology from twitter is symptomatic of a deeper malaise   17 years into massacre of 11 of a hindu family , bangladesh fails to deliver justice   belated realization that bharat betrayed tibet dawned on the eternal blunderer , j nehru , in the last years of his life . guilt of the 1962 humiliation roiled him . but like most egoistical leaders who never admit their mistakes , the story trotted_out , and readily accepted , was that the chinese had backstabbed him . which , at best , is a true lie .   tibet 's tragedy still arouses strong emotions . this was evident from a repeat viewing of jean - jacques Annaud 's moving 1997 film , seven_years in tibet . an austrian mountaineer 's autobiographical account ( based on the book of the same name ) of how a chance association with the 14   dalai_lama during his formative_years between 1939 - 50 changed him completely has a deep resonance which only the universal dharmic values of hindu_dharma , begetter of buddhism , can induce .   seventy_years after the jackboots of the people 's_liberation_army ( pla ) ravaged the roof of the world , we still have our heads buried in sand . while nehru surrendered bharat 's strategic_interests in tibet to occupier china in 1954 , it was the nationalist bjp which hammered the last nails in the coffin of our ties with tibet ,   a spiritual connect spread over centuries . lest it be forgotten it was the atal_bihari_vajpayee regime which formally recognized tibet as part of china in 2003 .   the real body_blow , however , was administered by prime_minister_narendra_modi . all official contact with the dalai_lama and tibet 's government in exile at dharamsala was discontinued in 2018 . reduced to a footnote from the past was the ravishment of lhasa in 1950 , and the dalai_lama 's flight to bharat nine years later . even personal equations were brushed_aside in the desire to cocker china . so_much_so_that modi_ji did_not even think it fit to wish the octogenarian seer on his birthday which falls on july_6 .   contrast this with the touching humility of the dalai_lama who has never failed to reiterate his kinship with bharat and how beholden he was to the benevolence and bigheartedness of its people . by opting to ignore a saint seen as the world 's foremost symbol of compassion and joy , the message sent out was that sincerity and sentiment no_longer had a place in

repeated intelligence_failures : time to worry army vehicles leaving for leh with military contingents for troops_deployed in ladakh , on the manali - leh route during the ongoing_dispute at the india - china line_of_actual_control , in Kullu on thursday . ani   keep_an_eye_on the developments in what is known as the ' central sector ' where initial though yet to be officially_confirmed reports coming in suggest that the chinese have increased their activity in the area opposite Chitkul in kinnaur district of himachal_pradesh .   the mother of all pandemics notwithstanding , it is fairly obvious that china had put_into_place the plans to take on india quite_some_time ago . what is also becoming obvious with_every_passing_day is that on the indian side , despite having a plethora of intelligence_agencies , the entire establishment has been caught not just napping , but are so badly compromised by their failure , they have no_choice_but to further cover_up by creating more and more smoke in the hope their little empires do not sink . for those in the know , who have been warning that the rot is extremely deep , all they can do is despair at the state of affairs as the pigeons come home to roost .   keep_an_eye_on the developments in what is known as the " central sector " where initial though yet to be officially_confirmed reports coming in suggest that the chinese have increased their activity in the area opposite Chitkul in kinnaur district of himachal_pradesh . as the crow_flies , this is not very far from Nelang , the border post north of Harsil in uttarakhand . even_though the frontier in these areas is demarcated and the international boundaries are well_defined , xi_jinping seems intent on testing the indians along the entire 3,500_km border . the scale of operations today is much_larger , but the pattern being followed seems to be exactly the same as what the chinese had done in the pre-1962 build_up .   the kargil_war_in_1999 was labelled as an " intelligence_failure " and reams and reams were subsequently written on how so - and - so warned this one , and that one warned these ones , but those who mattered failed to join the dots until one fine morning , using indian cement bought from indian companies in indian markets , pakistani sangars and bunkers were ready and their occupants were ready to cock a snook_at the indian_army . a couple_of_months later after it was realised that the heights around drass , kargil and batalik had indeed been occupied , with more_than_500 officers and men killed on the indian side , the surviving intruders mainly from the northern_light_infantry , were forced_to_withdraw across the loc . india rejoiced . it had won the limited war . we buried the pakistani dead , returned their eight prisoners and appointed a committee
australia rejects beijing 's south_china_sea claims , backing us jul 25 2020_04:24 pm   a chinese_coast_guard ship near the scarborough_shoal , a reef in the south_china_sea claimed_by_both china and the philippines , on june_18 , 2016 . as the u.s. and china clash over technology , territory and clout , a new geopolitical era is dawning .   sergey Ponomarev , the new_york_times / file   australia has rejected beijing 's territorial and maritime_claims in the south_china_sea in a formal declaration to the united_nations , aligning itself more closely with washington in the escalating row .   in a statement filed on thursday , australia said there was " no_legal_basis " to several disputed chinese claims in the sea including_those_related to the construction of artificial_islands on small shoals and reefs .

"   the declaration comes after us_secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo declared beijing 's pursuit of territory and resources in the south_china_sea as illegal , explicitly backing the territorial_claims of southeast_asian_countries against china 's .   beijing claims almost all of the south_china_sea based on a so - called nine - dash_line , a vague delineation from maps dating_back to the 1940s .   the latest escalation comes ahead of annual talks between australia and the united_states , with ministers travelling to washington for_the_first_time_since australian borders_were_closed due to the coronavirus_pandemic .   the meetings come at a " critical time " and it is essential they are held face - to - face , foreign_minister_marise_payne and defence_minister linda reynolds said in a statement on saturday .   us relations with china have markedly deteriorated in recent_months , especially over trade_disputes , the coronavirus_pandemic and beijing 's crackdown_on_dissent in hong_kong .   on friday , beijing ordered the us consulate_in_chengdu to shut in retaliation for the closure of its houston mission over accusations of being a hub for intellectual_property_theft .   payne and reynolds also penned an article in the australian newspaper on saturday , labelling national_security_legislation imposed on hong_kong last_month as " sweeping and vague " .

" the initiative was driven by the top political_leadership , " a government official said .   much of the discussion at the meeting revolved_around a presentation made by security_agencies that put the spotlight on two core areas ; telecom and higher_education .   security officials who briefed the top civil_servants spoke_about several_instances of universities_and_colleges tying up with chinese institutes through memorandum of understandings ( mous ) without the requisite approvals .   a classic_example cited by the security_establishment was the chinese - government funded confucius_institutes to promote han_chinese language_and_culture - typicality set_up in association with a local partner institution .   in the telecom_sector , security_agencies pointed to the telecom department 's instructions to state - run phone company bharat_sanchar_nigam limited , bsnl , to amend its tender to exclude chinese equipment makers from a large 4_g upgrade project .   but private phone companies often prefer chinese equipment because they are cheaper . there have also been allegations that large tenders are tailored to suit chinese_companies . industry body coai had last_month spoken against restrictions on private_companies , insisting that geopolitical_issues should be kept separate from corporate decisions .   the education and telecom ministries have been asked to review the chinese involvement in the two sectors in light of the presentation made by the security_agencies and chart the next steps for the sector .   the rule that requires approvals from the education ministry

Areu 's claims and determined them to be " false , patently frivolous and utterly devoid_of_any merit . " fox_news issued the statement on behalf of the network as_well_as mr. carlson , mr. hannity and mr. Kurtz , who were also named as defendants in the suit .   the network did_not challenge ms.

"   fox_news has said previously that it suspended mr. henry as_soon_as executives learned of ms.

chinese ' dam conspiracy ' to win future world_war fought over water chinese ' dam conspiracy ' to win future world_war fought over water   china has built a large_number of dams to control the flow of rivers to prepare itself to deal with future crises in the wake of a world_war fought over water .   china appeared to be successful in its attempt , hampering the interests of nations like thailand and vietnam , in its neighbourhood   the chinese conspiracy seems to have recoiled on it as floods this year in china have impacted more_than_40 million people in china   surprisingly , china has built more_than 87000 dams in the past_several_decades   flood in india 's several states is a recurrent phenomenon affecting millions every year and despite taking curative measures taken year after year the country appears to helpless before nature 's fury . on the contrary , china has built a large_number of dams to control the flow of rivers to prepare itself to deal with future crises in the wake of a world_war fought over water .   china appeared to be successful in its attempt , hampering the interests of nations like thailand and vietnam , in its neighbourhood . the dna analysis today tries to understand china 's alleged design to put its rivals on their knees . the chinese conspiracy seems to have recoiled on it as floods this year in china have impacted more_than_40 million people in china .   surprisingly , china has built more_than 87000 dams in the last several decades . the question_arises why did china build such a large_number of dams ? usually , dams are built to control floods , use water_for_irrigation , generate_electricity , and store water , but china 's intention lies somewhere_else .   china wants to use water as a weapon . we need to first understand china 's intentions through a few_examples . firstly , china 's largest river yangtze and its_tributaries have witnessed the construction of about 100 dams until seven_years_ago . now , how many dams would have been built after seven_years .   secondly , china has built 11 dams on the mekong_river , which is the seventh major river in asia and flows through southwestern china to countries like myanmar , laos , thailand , cambodia , and vietnam . these dams were built to control the waters of mekong_river , whose tributaries are the lifeline for more_than_60 million people in southeast_asia . china , however , decides the fate of these people through dams on this river .   the third example is the brahmaputra_river , on which china got built the Zang - mu dam in 2015 . in tibet , china is building three more dams on the brahmaputra_river , which originates in

beijing may target british companies if 10_downing_street sanctions china beijing may target british companies if 10_downing_street sanctions china   by chen Qingqing source : global_times_published : 2020/7/20 21:33:40 last_updated : 2020/7/20 22:54:18   the british government has been urged to make a " smart choice " and not to burn bridges by continuing to provoke china on matters such as hong_kong , xinjiang , huawei and the south_china_sea , and dance to the tune of americans . otherwise , it will face_severe consequences of souring uk - china ties , officials and observers warned .   before us_secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo 's visit to the uk on monday , uk foreign_secretary_dominic_raab has been escalating his harsh rhetoric on china ,   that the british government has suspended its extradition_treaty with the hong_kong_special_administrative_region ( hksar ) .   in the face of escalating_tensions not only with the uk but also with the us , retaliation is always the last choice for the chinese government , some observers said . however , if the uk , as part of the five_eyes , upholds such a hostile_attitude toward china , beijing may have no_other_choice but to strike at british companies like hsbc and jaguar land_rover in response to the sanctions_imposed by 10_downing_street , observers_noted .   such a move is seen as " symbolic , " as the uk has parroted us ' tone in rejection of china 's recently_passed national_security_law_for_hong_kong . the uk 's possible move is also dangerous as it is very likely to further undermine china - uk relations , particularly after the huawei ban , which is widely_believed to be a disastrous decision of taking china - the uk 's most_important business_partner - as its enemy .   china is firmly_opposed to raab 's remarks about suspending the extradition_treaty with the hksar , urging the uk not to go further down the wrong_path to avoid further damaging china - uk relations , wang_wenbin ,   , told a routine_press_conference on monday .   the uk 's recent misrepresentations and actions on hong_kong affairs have ignored the fact that the national_security_law_for_hong_kong has helped stabilize the " one country , two systems , " and have seriously_violated the basic_norms of international_law , which is also a blatant interference in china 's internal_affairs , wang said .   pompeo is scheduled_to_meet british_prime_minister_boris_johnson and raab on monday , to discuss the coronavirus_outbreak , issues_related to the hksar , as_well_as us - uk free_trade_agreement negotiations , according to a statement on the us department of state 's website .   britain followed the trump_administration 's instructions in banning huawei last_week , even_though it argued strongly that the decision had_nothing_to_do_with the us .   " this visit serves as a ' pep talk ' for the uk , following london 's rejection of huawei and other
xi_jinping shows his clownish evil with ren Zhiqiang punishment proving his own paranoia , chinese_president_xi_jinping has reacted ferociously to being described as a clown .   as the chinese_communist_party 's discipline bureau , the central commission for discipline inspection , is responsible for enforcing xi 's will over the communist_party membership . and on thursday , the commission proudly   that ren Zhiqiang had been expelled from the party for " serious violations of discipline and law . "   who is ren , and what are his " violations ? "   well , he 's a property executive and , by chinese_communist legal standards , serial thoughtcrime offender . writing satirical articles in favor of political freedom , ren crossed a communist_party red_line earlier_this_year when he   xi as a " clown . " ren added , " the emperor is holding up a piece_of_cloth , trying to cover_up the fact that he is wearing no clothes at all . " good stuff . except if you 're xi or one of his drones . ren was quickly   into china 's gulag apparatus . now the commission has explained why . it says that ren " vilified the image of the party and the country ... and was not loyal to the party . " Amusingly , if absurdly , the commission adds that ren " seriously_violated " his " life discipline " and was caught " using public funds to purchase golf [ memberships ] . "   ren remains in the gulag , and his ultimate fate wo_n't be clear for the foreseeable_future . still , this massive overreaction to a humorous article speaks_volumes_about xi and the regime he leads .   for a start , it illustrates xi 's abiding insecurity and his paranoia about being perceived as weak . under great scrutiny for his handling of the coronavirus_pandemic and ability to advance his   of a china - led international order , xi also fears a political drift away from his supreme authority . hence , we see xi 's increasingly agitated and repressive_policies toward taiwan , hong_kong , and the uighur_population of xinjiang_province . this is a dynamic u.s. policymakers must be astute to as they increase pressure on xi in relation to chinese   . xi is increasingly likely to make policy not only in consideration of china 's interests but also in consideration of how his actions make him appear as a leader .   but the broader takeaway from ren 's purging is what it says about china as a nation .   blessed with 1.4_billion people , a great history , and extraordinary culture , and bountiful resources , china has much opportunity . unfortunately , under xi 's communist_party , that opportunity is subjugated to

lessons on violence for u.s. police from roman Centurions american police should know where rome wen ...   ancient notions of authority show where u.s. policing went_wrong .   a frieze on an altar in rome dedicated to the goddess peace shows Augustus with his cape pulled over his head , rex sacorum or high priest , four priests , and a lictor bearing an ax , circa 13 b.c.   PHAS / universal images group via_getty_images   faced with civil_unrest in almost every major american city , brought on by the collapse of police legitimacy as the result of a number of shocking videos of misconduct , defense_secretary_mark_esper   : " we need to dominate the battlespace " of u.s. cities , with military force . president_donald_trump echoed this advice calling on governors to use the national_guard and even regular military to restore_order , to achieve , in his words , " total domination . " " if a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary   then i will deploy the united_states military and quickly solve_the_problem for them , " he declared . the theme of domination and threats of further escalation subsequently permeated administration rhetoric , even as more soldiers were called to the capital .   threatening to send in the troops like this made for some tough - sounding bravadoeven though it was rapidly walked_back as the president claimed that he was actually talking_about " dominating the streets with compassion . " as federal forces   in portland , that language is returning , since the administration loves the tropes of militarism . but if the administration thinks that all it needs to do at home is to " dominate the battlespace , " then it has misunderstood the role of armed force and fallen into a classic error in security thinking . they have mistaken violence for power , a mistake that leaders have been making quite_literally since the ancient world .   the philosopher hannah arendt expounded on the distinction_between violence and power in her seminal 1972 essay "   . " violence , the ability of the state to coerce using armed force , is contrasted with power , " the human ability to act in concert " used by a leader only inasmuch_as they are " empowered by a certain number of people to act in their name . " the university_of_north_carolina military history professor wayne lee   , intermediate category to this analysis : force . force in this sense includes violence but is extended to include also the threat of violence , including the threat implied by the mere existence of force without its application .   consider the example of driving up to a red_light . if you were to attempt to

" the ramjet motor [ propulsion system ] provides the [ meteor ] missile with thrust all the way to target intercept , providing the largest no - escape zone of any air - to - air_missile , " the literature on the missile on MBAD website reads .   here 's what this means : when a meteor missile is fired , it is able to throttle its engine back while it is flying towards its target in the cruise phase .   this saves a lot of its fuel . when the missile reaches close to its target , it throttles up its engine using the saved fuel and enters the terminal phase of its flight in a high - energy state .   in comparison , in a standard air - to - air_missile , the propulsion system delivers energy in an unmodulated manner , providing the same amount of thrust over a certain period as it ca_n't be throttled .   if the target is far , the missile will have less energy in the terminal phase of its flight than

"   hussain 's account of direct_involvement by the military and political authorities in censoring stories critical to the government was repeated by half_a_dozen journalists . the pressure was reportedly exerted both through direct edicts to editors and producers , to less direct but more costly interventions such as pulling tv_stations from transmission , targeting advertising_revenue of dissenting media or pulling newspapers from circulation .   in many cases , the trend towards heavy censorship pre - dates khan 's premiership , but he has been criticised for allowing it to continue , if not ramping it up . in 2017 , mohammed_hanif ,   a celebrated pakistani novelist and satirist   , was surprised to open

growing global_recognition as pm 's smart_lockdown_strategy paying_dividends with a steep_decline from around 6800 covid19 patients a day in mid_june to 1209 during_the_last_24_hours across pakistan , the world 's acknowledgement for prime_minister_imran_khan 's smart_lockdown_strategy , mainly focussed on the balance_between_lives_and_livelihood , is growing .   on june_13 , pakistan had reported 6,825 coronavirus_cases out of 29,546 tests   the highest score so_far in the country . during_the_last_24_hours , only 1,206 persons tested_positive of a total of 22,006 tests .   however , courtesy of the prime_minister 's undeterred opposition to the blanket_lockdown , the country kept away the feared economic disaster faced by the countries in the region and in the developed world .   " the only solution , as the world has discovered , is a smart_lockdown , which allows_for_economic_activity_with_sops . we are amongst the pioneers_of_this_approach " , the prime_minister said on twitter .   in its latest study , the imperial_college of london ranked pakistan at fourth lowest for coronavirus reproduction in the country based on july 20 data . pakistan has achieved 0.73 rate and countries getting below 1 rating are considered the best for their anti - covid efforts . interestingly , the countries_including_germany and portugal which rank above pakistan are also advocating the very concept_of_smart_lockdown to prevent a new surge_in_coronavirus_infections . beside the administrative_measures to ensure_strict closure of hotspots , the prime_minister repeatedly addressed the nation , advising them for strict_precautions to avert the disaster .   " now as the results show that this measure works , many developing_nations are also promoting the policy . germany , italy and portugal are also discussing urban shutdowns to avert a new increase in infections of coronavirus . more and more countries are closing_down smaller territories , as opposed to shutting_down the whole country " , noted the bangladesh - based the business_standard while lauding the prime_minister 's smart_lockdown_approach that was taken despite " fierce_opposition . "   the rationale_behind the smart_lockdown was to protect the country , particularly the daily_wagers , from the worst economic scenario in a country where millions already live_below_the_poverty_line . with_the_passage_of_time , not merely countries but the international_organisations , joined the prime_minister 's call for balancing between_lives_and_livelihood to avert massive_layoffs and consequent deaths due to hunger .   " by the end of the year , 12,000 people per day could die_from_hunger linked to covid-19 , potentially more_than will die from the disease itself . this is more_than the peak global coronavirus death_rate of 10,000 per day in april " , reports oxfam , an international confederation of 20 ngos_working in over 90 countries against injustices causing poverty . "new hunger hotspots are also emerging . middle - income countries such as india , south_africa , and brazil are experiencing rapidly_rising levels of hunger as millions of people that were just about managing have
maharashtra : will choose a rickshaw over bullet_train any day , says uddhav_thackeray on mva alliance in the second part of his extensive interview to party_mouthpiece saamana , chief_minister_uddhav_thackeray focuses_on alliance teething troubles and politics at large .   maharashtra_chief_minister_uddhav_thackeray ( file_photo )   cm thackeray says he speaks to both sharad_pawar and sonia_gandhi   thackeray challenges opposition to try and destabilise his government   taking_a_jibe_at rajasthan crisis , thackeray says those quitting original parties have n't got cm position in new parties   taking_a_jibe_at the leader of opposition devendra_fadnavis ' description of the maha_vikas_aghadi as a three - wheeler government , chief_minister_uddhav_thackeray in his interview to saamana editor sanjay_raut , said that he would choose an autorickshaw any day over a bullet_train , as the rickshaw was used by the poor , while also saying the steering was firm with him .   the bullet_train has long been a symbol of the central bjp , so the remark is also being seen as an indication that for now , the shiv_sena prefers the mva over the previous alliance it had with the bjp . thackeray also commented that he exited the previous alliance because he only realised the intentions of the party later .   speaking on his equation with the other parties in the alliance , namely the congress and the ncp , the chief_minister assured that the lack of face_to_face meetings due to coronavirus restrictions did have an impact on the co - ordination initially .   he also acknowledged that congress had playfully mentioned that they felt he was more inclined_towards the ncp . thackeray , however , claimed that he had spoken to the party_leaders and there were no such misgivings anymore .   while thackeray 's equation and frequent_meetings with sharad_pawar have received much press , the relationship with the congress has been under a bit of a cloud . in response_to_a_question , thackeray assured that he also spoke to sonia_gandhi on the phone once in a while , trying to indicate all was well in the alliance .   in response_to_a_question on allegations that the government functioning was left entirely to bureaucrats , thackeray wondered_if those making_such_statements wanted to get_rid of secretaries and do all the work themselves .   taking the example of nagpur 's controversial municipal_commissioner Tukaram Mundhe , the chief_minister said that wherever a bureaucrat was bringing in better functioning he would back him / her , dismissing complaints against Mundhe by senior_bjp_leaders including union_minister_nitin_gadkari . this particular sequence of questions_and_answers was also an indication to those in the congress and his own party who had earlier complained that bureaucrats do_n't_listen to them .   interestingly the thackeray government had recently also brought out a notification reiterating a fadnavis era rule asking bureaucrats not to give precedence to

" india continues to modernize its_nuclear_arsenal , with at_least three new weapon_systems now under development to complement or replace existing nuclear - capable aircraft , land - based delivery_systems , and sea - based systems . several of these systems are nearing_completion and will soon be combat - ready , " according to the report .

why pm_modi 's ' Dravidi Pranayam ' failed at chabahar in 2016 , india , iran and afghanistan signed_an_agreement to establish a transit and transport_corridor using the chabahar_port . this was an_alternative_route and so roundabout that it was the equivalent of taking one 's hand behind one 's head to reach the nostril .   an iranian guard looks on at oil docks at the port of Kalantari in the city of chabahar , 300_km ( 186 miles ) east of the strait_of_hormuz . photo :   no offence meant to the great dravidian culture , but it is necessary to use the metaphor of '   ' to describe prime_minister_narendra_modi 's major foreign_policy failure at chabahar_port_in_iran .   before i tell_you_what '   ' is , let_me state my main_argument upfront : the failure at chabahar can be corrected only if india   in cooperation with china , pakistan , afghanistan , iran and other countries in the region   begins to do the ' connectivity   ' in south_asia and elsewhere the normal way .   to put it simply , india will have to partner with china in its belt_and_road_initiative at some point in future if it is serious about having land - based economic , trade and travel links with countries in our western and eastern neighbourhood , central_asia and eurasia .   bri , the ambitious_plan to modernise the road , rail , port , energy and industrial infrastructure , and revitalise socio - cultural bonds , along the ancient territorial and maritime_silk routes linking china to asia , africa_and_europe , is a reality india can_not_ignore , much less compete against . unveiled in two stages by chinese_president_xi_jinping in 2013   the " silk_road_economic_belt " in kazakhstan and the"21st_century_maritime_silk_road " in indonesia bri 's seven - year history has indeed highlighted its several shortcomings in both design and execution .   nevertheless , adhering to their ancient adage of " crossing the river by feeling the stones " , the chinese will continue to experiment , learn from their mistakes , and improve it by incorporating domestic and global feedback . but will they abandon it ? no . rather , they will implement it with the same determination that they displayed in building the great_wall many centuries_ago . indeed , bri 's regional and trans - regional footprint dwarfs the great_wall .   therefore , india can in no way circumvent china if it wants to become a major_contributor to , and also a big beneficiary of , asia 's future regional_connectivity and cooperation architecture . what india and china can cooperatively achieve is far_greater_than what each can do separately . defying this logic , the modi government has tried to pursue its_own separate connectivity plan with iran .

" she was my special mother , " cookie said . then glancing at her white casket , she addressed sr_ruth directly .   " you made me big , you sent me to school . you took me with you whenever you went . i ca_n't believe you are not here , " she said .   the 77 - year - old sister had been in charge of dar_ul_sukun for 51 years   " thank_you_very_much for all you did for me . i_love_you so much i_do_n't_know_what i will do without you . i will miss you , " she finished making all those present at the funeral and all those watching it live cry .   cookie lewis pays_homage to her ' special mother ' on wednesday . fahim_siddiqi / white_star   the 77 - year - old sister had been in charge of dar_ul_sukun for 51 years . dar_ul_sukun is home for the elderly , socially displaced girls_and_boys but above all it is home for physically_challenged children with severe disabilities . many of them , like cookie , have been born with deformities and are left there by their_own parents . cookie 's mother had left her there because she wanted a normal child . sr_ruth then even gave her own surname ' lewis ' to her . today all the children , nuns and staff feel heartbroken to have lost someone they all looked up to as their_own mother . she was an inspiration for the entire staff of dar_ul_sukun who tried walking in her footsteps . still , they say , there_will_be_no one quite like her and she has left_behind very big shoes to fill .   sr_ruth got_infected earlier_this_month while taking_care of some 21 children at the home who were also down with the coronavirus . after_testing_positive herself , she was admitted to the aga_khan_hospital

what i see when i see india 's policy on jammu_&_kashmir as a kashmiri_pandit log in / sign_up   a landmark announcement on august_5 , 2019 took the world , and all of india , by surprise . the news of the neutering of article_370 , thereby , revoking_the_special_status of jammu_and_kashmir ( j&k ) was unprecedented and unexpected . in an immediate backlash , pakistan expelled the indian_envoy ajay Basaria from islamabad in a move to downgrade diplomatic_ties with india .   as the shackles of special_provisions were removed from j&k , the now short - circuited introduction of a domicile legislation seems to be a distraction from the more contentious matters in j&k. when the entire_country was celebrating the removal of barriers for any indian citizen from investing or settling in j&k , the implementation of a domicile_law starts building iron curtains yet again , preventing india from direct_access into its_own union_territory . what is more frustrating is altaf_bukhari , founder of the jammu kashmir_apni_party ( jkap ) , founded on regionalism , meets with home_minister_amit_shah and receives assurance that the statehood will be returned to j&k soon . this came in a response to concerns_raised by the bukhari led jkap delegation on the article_370 removal .   while one is still grappling_with what the actual stance is of the current government , a hindu   ( leader of a village ) , ajay_pandita , is brutally_murdered in the valley in june 2020 . this has further angered the already disillusioned the kashmiri_pandits , hindus from kashmir_valley . it has reminded the country that justice was yet far from delivered for the millions of displaced kashmiri_hindus and those murdered , raped , looted within genocidal crime in 1989 - 90 . thirty_years on , there_is_no formal recognition of kashmiri_pandits as internally_displaced or refugees in their_own country .   the entire_process of domicile registration seems like a trap to white - wash the truth and hijack the real lacuna in justice delivery system in india . whose demand was it to introduce domicile_law in j&k ? whose interests and whims are being pandered to ?   it will be interesting_to_note here that india was among the early signatories to the united_nations ( un ) convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes of genocide in 1949 , later ratifying it in 1959 . contract bound to legislate genocide crime_prevention and punishment law , india , though , is yet to introduce such a law . when one looks at the full picture , there are visible and seemingly deliberate holes in india 's policy in relation to j&k , domestic or otherwise .   narratives emerge based on realities_on_the_ground and how they are communicated to the world . it seems that india 's narrative is a ' free - for - all '
indians in china say life was peaceful in china until india 's ban of wechat indians in china say life was peaceful in china until india 's ban of wechat   by li lei and hu Yuwei source : global_times_published : 2020/7/27 22:24:33   a user uses his smartphone while logos of wechat are seen on the background , 14 may 2020 . photo : ic   many indian people in china said that their life in china was calm even during the border_clash in may , but a ban on chinese_mobile_apps , especially on wechat , which is the latest to cease providing service in india , has severely_affected their lives and businesses .   the indian government has been targeting chinese_apps and the country reportedly banned 47 more chinese_apps on monday , following its ban_on_59 chinese_apps on june_29 , including hit short_video_app tik_tok . on the same day , a report by the economic times said that india is planning to investigate 275 chinese_apps for violation of national_security and user_privacy .   wechat has been out of service among its indian users since saturday after its company tencent sending a notification to its users , according to indian media Entrackr . in the notification , tencent explained they are " engaging with relevant_authorities and hope to be_able_to resume service in the future . "   imran brown , a tourism practitioner who is studying chinese language at shenyang normal university in northeast china 's liaoning_province , told_the_global_times his business plan has been ruined by the indian government 's ban on chinese_apps , especially on wechat .   " closing wechat is a mistake . people are in panic , which will make our life more difficult , " brown told_the_global_times , adding that " wechat is a very_important platform for indian people who have business interaction with chinese . "   brown worked in a travel agency when he was in india . he found the income of his indian colleagues who speak chinese and receive chinese tourists is much_higher_than those who only receive indian tourists .   so , 38 - year - old brown decided to come to china to study chinese in a two and half year language program to boost his income .   he is supposed to return to bombay this month , but he never expected the coronavirus to severely affect global tourism . moreover , banning wechat makes other chinese - related business_ideas impossible .   " i shared my life here in china with my friends in india . they were all interested in visiting china , " said brown . in the last_two_years , he received some of his friends in china and traveled to many cities together with them , and many of them started considering doing_business

here is why some indians continue to peddle negative notions about the possibility of # FabInIndia a semiconductor plant in india . representative_image .   let_us_hope that the efforts to achieve # FabInIndia do not get nipped_in_the_bud , by a handful of people .   these people are either driven by vested_interests or by their inability or refusal to come out of their past notions , and end up trying to damage efforts towards the missing piece of # FabInIndia .   after commerce minister_piyush_goyal   that the government of india was very keen to have a semiconductor fab plant in india   and also that the country would really want_to_see ( semiconductor ) fab ( plant ) coming up quickly , thereby inviting suggestions on how to go about achieving the same , articles started coming in some media fora about # FabInIndia .   had a positive outlook and quoted a realistic $_2_billion investment needed , some others , which i will not refer or quote here , continue to peddle the myth of why india will_not_be_able_to do it .   past experience tells_me that this kind of negative articles will continue to keep coming and some ' big shot ' indians or nris themselves may even try to kill any ' baby efforts ' in this direction .   mind you , ' big shot ' in any other field , even if it is a semiconductor design field , need not translate_into an expert on semiconductor fabs .   in this short article , i present three different_kinds of ' people ' who spread the negative notion that # FabInIndia will never happen .   1 ) there are people who continue to ' believe ' that # FabInIndia can happen only with $ 8-$10b investment . i have   in detail about why india need not aim for a high - investment , cutting - edge tech - node first , but there is enough market till year 2025 and beyond for , let us say , 28 nm digital ( which may need $_2.5_billion investment ) or maybe a 45 nm or 65 nm analog fab ( $_1.5_billion investment ) .   i_am told that these were also independently confirmed recently by a reputed market research group in a detailed_study , done at the behest of a certain group .   unfortunately , some ' semiconductor veterans ' in india , who come from the design side , have only limited knowledge of fabs , and many times even only specific know - how of even the design world and/or are stuck in past notions but still like to claim themselves as ' fab experts ' .   2 ) over the last_few_months , i have also realised that there

" pushing through eight nominations at this time in the cyclesome rather controversial to bootwould be tough under the best circumstances , " mara Karlin , a former deputy_assistant_secretary of defense during president_barack_obama 's administration , told   . without a point person on legislative affairs , she said , " it will be even less_likely . "   hood departs as the pentagon has seen its relationship with capitol_hill reach a low point on a range_of_issues . earlier_this_year , esper   bipartisan pushback from lawmakers after the trump_administration opted to reprogram billions_of_dollars toward the u.s.-mexico border wall from accounts overseen_by congress , raising anger about a possible end run around lawmakers .   congress also pushed_back forcefully on esper 's handling of the white_house 's demands for active - duty u.s. troop_deployments to the washington area during nationwide_protests against police_brutality_and_racial injustice after the death_of_george_floyd , with house armed services chairman adam_smith , a democrat , slamming a seeming " lack_of_coordination " in the response .   former senate aides say that hood , a long - tenured legislative affairs staffer during the george_w. bush_administration and a former senior aide to speaker of the house Newt Gingrich , was active in getting nominees onto the legislative calendar , answering_questions from lawmakers , and arranging office calls between the trump_administration 's
my mental_health journey : how ptsd gave me the strength to share my story covering traumatic stories and facing distressing circumstances take a toll on journalists . newsrooms must address it , but taboos are in the way .   the author   introducing a panel she was moderating at news Xchange on the subject of gendered online_harassment .   at the end of last_year , i was diagnosed_with post - traumatic stress disorder , or ptsd , as_a_result of multiple traumatic experiences in my journalism career and my personal life .   i suspect my experiences may resonate with some colleagues who still suffer in silence .   it 's encouraging to see some news_organizations creating safe_spaces for more open conversations about mental_health and ensuring emotional safety is as much a part of the culture as physical safety . where they lead , i hope others will start to follow . unfortunately for now , taboos remain .   i_am publicly sharing my journey for the first time to try to tackle some of those taboos and the stigma_around mental_health that still silences journalists .   admitting vulnerability can impact career prospects . individuals who are traditionally marginalized within our industry , including journalists_of_color , are less_likely to feel_safe speaking about their suffering , and yet more likely to be at risk of mental_stress .   as a profession , we need to see that the structures which perpetuate inequity in our industry often prevent those who are less_privileged from feeling safe speaking about the burdens they carry .   recent_years have given rise to a perfect_storm of factors_impacting the mental_health of journalists .   relentless breaking stories , a rise in attacks against the press , a crisis of trust , job_cuts , sinking ad revenues causing stress , burnout , vicarious trauma , moral injury , and exhaustion have taken their toll on the mental_health of individuals and the cultural and economical health of our industry . if we are n't well , we ca_n't do our best work .   even before the global_pandemic , i heard many anecdotes of colleagues on the brink . many of them were women , impacted by an industry where they were exposed to gendered attacks in the field , newsroom and online . others were freelancers affected by job_insecurity .   a growing_number of studies examining journalists suggest that they experience ptsd at a rate higher_than the general population , said clinical_psychologist and trauma specialist kevin becker . in the u.s. , the lifetime prevalence for ptsd is 8 % . studies of journalists exhibiting ptsd range from 4 % to a high of 59 % ( for photojournalists working in conflict_zones ) depending on conditions , locations and job duties .   more recently ,
the silk roads : before and after Richthofen the silk roads : before and after Richthofen   an exhibition by the silk museum , china   china 's historic silk_route has long captured imaginations as large trade networks that connected ancient china to empires of central_asia across hundreds of years . the silk_route , which started in guangzhou in the 2nd century_bc and remained in use till the 18th_century , is no_longer seen as exclusive to china 's history . it is now seen as a key network for understanding how global politics and cooperation have evolved since_ancient_times . to celebrate not only the road but also the history of its discovery and excavation , the china national silk museum has inaugurated the exhibition " the silk roads : before and after Richthofen . "   the china national silk museum ( CNSM ) was founded in february 1992 near the west lake of hangzhou as one of china 's first state museums . its purpose was to research , conserve and display chinese textiles , such as silk . since most of the silk indigenous to china has been found along the silk_route , in multiple parts of the xinjiang_province , and Dunhuang of the gansu_province , the museum has devoted a considerable_amount of its resources to studying and preserving relics from the silk_road .   its main_focus is how the road has been shaped by people , and the connections they make , whether as merchants along the actual trade_route or groups of archaeologists from various countries who came together for excavation . the exhibition pays_tribute to ferdinand von Richthofen , a german geographer who first coined the term in 1877 , and his student sven Hardin who launched the first of the expeditions . it traces the road 's beginnings from zhang qian 's mission in 138BC and emperor Wudi of the han dynasty 's official establishment of trade_routes , to its official recognition as a unesco heritage_site in 2014 .   a portrait of ferdinand von Richthofen   the first half of the exhibition focuses_on the various networks and transactions which took_place on the silk_road , as reconstructed by the evidence found . prior to the silk_road , there was small_scale trade happening due to the expansion of the Macedonians , persians and Mauryans . but the silk_road established official networks for trade_and_commerce which extended into these other empires mentioned_earlier . extensive documentation on bamboo slips provide a plethora of material , whether they were rates of products , receipts of transactions , or written accounts of interactions with new civilizations and cultures .   a buddhist stone slab ( credits to wu Huixin )   this part of the exhibition also includes the journeys of missionaries and famed explorers like buddhist_monks and missionaries , suleiman the magnificent

ilhan_omar campaign Mailer accuses opponent of being ' in the pocket of wall_street ' and only quotes jewish donors by name ilhan_omar campaign Mailer accuses opponent of being ' in the pocket of wall_street ' and only quotes jewish donors byName   the mailer references three jewish donors , plus " michael , a donor from Scarsdale , new_york . "   rep. ilhan_omar 's ( d - minn. ) campaign recently sent out a mail piece ripping her primary opponent , attorney Antone Melton - Meaux , for the large donations he 's gotten from wealthy and moderate donors . the only donors to her opponent identified by name in the mailer are jewish .   the mailer , received by voters in the district last_week and obtained by vice news , leads with the headline " can we trust Antone Melton - Meaux 's money ? " it accuses him of being " in the pocket of the gop , " " in the pocket of wall_street , " and " in the pocket of the medical industry , " and pulls various quotes from a   about his donors attacking omar .   the only names cited in the mailer are stanley weinstein , a retired real_estate executive from miami_beach who was the only on - record buzzfeed quote ; billionaire jonathan gray , the head of Blackstone group private_equity_firm ; and seth Klarman , a billionaire hedge_fund owner who has donated in the past to the gop . all three men are jewish ( both MinnPost and the mailer inaccurately refer to gray as " john " ) .   none of Melton - Meaux 's other donors are mentioned by name in the mailer . the only other quote with identifying information attached to it is from " michael , a donor from Scarsdale , new_york " one of the wealthiest and most heavily jewish towns in the country .   Melton - Meaux has raised an eye - popping amount for a little - known house challenger   $_3.2 million in the last quarter   and much of that money has come from pro - israel organizations as_well_as jewish donors , some of whom have donated in the past to republicans or work on wall_street . it 's a common campaign tactic for progressives to attack their moderate foes for taking big corporate money . but by solely mentioning jewish donors by name while painting Melton - Meaux as being in their " pocket " to do their bidding on financial issues , her campaign 's mailer makes an argument that critics see as an anti - semitic trope especially in light of her string of previous controversial_remarks about israel .   the mail piece has triggered a heated_debate within minneapolis ' jewish_community .

exclusive : french limits on huawei_5_g equipment amount to de_facto ban by 2028 exclusive : french limits on huawei_5_g equipment amount to de_facto ban by 2028   paris ( reuters ) - french authorities have told telecoms operators planning to buy huawei_5_g equipment that they wo_n't_be_able_to renew licences for the gear once they expire , effectively phasing the chinese_firm out of mobile_networks , three sources close to the matter said .   file_photo : a view shows a huawei logo at huawei_technologies france headquarters in Boulogne - Billancourt near paris , france , july_15 , 2020 . reuters / gonzalo Fuentes   like other countries in europe , france is laying the ground for its next - generation 5_g mobile market in the middle of a growing geopolitical storm between two global superpowers .   the united_states say the company 's equipment could_be_used by the chinese government for espionage - a charge denied by huawei and beijing - and has pressed its allies to ban it .   france 's cybersecurity agency ANSSI said this month it would allow operators to use equipment , including huawei 's , under licences of three to eight years . but it added it was urging telcos not currently using the chinese company 's gear to avoid switching to it .   operators must each apply for dozens of licences for equipment to cover different_parts of the country .   the sources said ANSSI had informed operators of most licence decisions for large cities . they said the bulk of authorisations for huawei gear were for three or five_years , while most of those for equipment from european rivals ericsson   ANSSI 's decisions have not been made public , either by the agency or by the companies .   the sources added that operators had also been told by french authorities during informal conversations in recent_months , not stated formally in documents , that licences granted for huawei equipment would not be renewed thereafter .   a spokesman for the prime_minister 's office , which_oversees the permissions on 5_g equipment , said ANSSI was working with operators within the legal_framework , adding that any authorisation granted at present did_not impinge on whether these would later be renewed or interrupted .   such restrictions , though , would amount to a de_facto phase - out of huawei within france 's 5_g_networks by 2028 , given the short time - frame of the licenses , according to the sources , who_declined_to_be_named because of the sensitivity_of_the_matter .   french operators might still manage to get an eight - year authorisation for huawei equipment in some cases , and could yet decide to use its gear for that time period , the sources said . but even this meant eventually dismantling it , they added
the d.c. establishment 's dangerous china delusion exclusive : curtis ellis pummels ' experts ' whose foreign_policy with beijing has failed for decades   published july 24 , 2020 at 7:50pm   secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo joined a string of administration officials laying out the true_nature of the chinese_communist_party .   national_security_adviser_robert_o'brien spoke_about its ideology . fbi_director chris wray talked_about its espionage . attorney_general_william_barr spoke_about its economic threat .   pompeo put it all together , detailing what the ccp means for our economy , our liberty and the future of democracies around the world .   in the midst of all this the administration took action .   it imposed_sanctions on chinese_companies using slave_labor to produce goods for such major international brands as apple , ralph_lauren , google , hp and tommy Hilfiger .   it sanctioned chinese officials , businesses and banks complicit in crushing freedom in hong_kong .   and it took the unprecedented action of closing the chinese_consulate in houston , the ccp 's base for espionage .   these actions represent a sharp break from past administrations , both democratic_and_republican , who imagined economic_engagement would make china more free and america more prosperous .   there is now no argument the ccp did_not become more democratic , and its predatory trade practices , espionage and outright theft have exacted a steep toll on our economy and society .   but the eminentos of the foreign - policy establishment still argue over what to do about the regime 's malign behavior .   while the experts_say china is guilty of bad_things , when_it_comes_to solutions they resort to clichs and a rose - colored view of the world .   as the brilliant fulbright university_professor chris Balding   one of the favorite clichs of the divorced - from - reality experts is " we must work with our allies to take on china . "   in the real world , countries have concrete reasons for not confronting china .   our nato_ally germany still has n't denounced the ccp 's concentration_camps and human_rights_abuses in hong_kong for fear_of_losing access to china 's market .   and by the way , this idea of " working with allies to manage china " is what we 've_been_doing for decades . that 's what the world_trade_organization and the alphabet soup of u.n. agencies is all about . the thinking went we and our allies would bring china into the club of civilized countries and teach it country club behavior .   instead it became the turd in the punchbowl and now demands we all drink up .   so for those who say " we must work with our allies , " the question is how exactly they propose convincing angela_merkel it 's bad

yes , let 's ban chinese_communist_party members critics are aghast that president_donald_trump may , as   , deny visas to members of the chinese_communist_party ( ccp ) and their families . the paper also states that his administration is even thinking of taking a more drastic_step : revoking visas to such individuals already in the united_states .   furthermore , trump may extend the ban , which would be issued under the authority of the immigration and nationality act , to members of the people 's_liberation_army and executives of state enterprises .   the trump_administration has already been denying visas to china 's officials and other chinese_nationals , including those_responsible_for repression of uyghurs_and_other muslims , journalists , students with links to chinese military institutions and employees of huawei and other chinese_tech_companies . the just - signed hong_kong_autonomy_act authorizes still more visa denials .   in sum , a visa prohibition , as the   notes , could affect as many as 270_million chinese . in a country of 1.43 billion people , that is about one in every five residents .   moreover , because virtually all the country 's elites belong to that organization , this prohibition , if it were enforced , would result in a complete_breakdown in relations with china .   the ccp , now more_than 99 years_old , is no_longer a revolutionary vanguard . a crucial transition occurred in may 2000 , when jiang_zemin , considered the leader of the party 's third generation , sponsored the three represents ideological campaign . the ccp , according to jiang 's campaign , must always be representative of the foremost productive forces in society , of the most_advanced culture and of the fundamental_interests of the people .   in this major ideological shiftideology is critical in communist Chinaprivate entrepreneurs , once the class " enemy " of workers and peasants , were welcomed into the ruling organization , helping to transform it from revolutionary to mundane .   the ccp no_longer talks about the three represents , but that formulation nonetheless remains its guiding spirit . it has become , in recent_years , even more of a bureaucratic organizationand in some cases , a social club or chamber_of_commerce . many chinese now join the ccp not to work for the attainment of the perfect state of CommunismMarxist zealots are not in great supply in china , these daysbut to get ahead in business , gain a leadership_role in arts organizations or attain social prominence .   as_a_result , the party has become , as some say , " flabby , " and flabby party members are harmless to the united_states . " the overwhelming_majority of ccp members have no involvement or input into beijing 's policymaking , so going after the entire party_membership is like china sanctioning

imran_khan speaks with hasina_wajed : bold initiative towards bangladesh ? in what appears like a diplomatic coup , pm_imran_khan spoke with bangladesh 's pm , sheikh_hasina wajid . he also invited her to visit pakistan , many suspect that china may have helped_bring pakistan and bangladesh close to each_other - as part of china 's silent process of isolating india in the south_asian_region .   prime_minister of pakistan , imran_khan on wednesday expressed_his_desire for " closer and fraternal " relations_with_bangladesh , by speaking to the pm , sheikh_hasina wajid .   imran_khan takes bold initiativetowards bangladesh   pakistan and bangladesh : is china helping ?   many analysts in islamabad   and on pakistani media   had been predicting that given how modi_regime had treated bangladesh on caa issue , china may work upon bangladesh to take it away from delhi 's exclusive sphere_of_influence . these whispers had increased with the indo - china standoff_in_ladakh and with the change in nepal 's attitude_towards delhi .   it was getting obvious   in islamabad 's diplomatic_circles   that china was flexing_its diplomatic muscle in the region around india . it is believed that india 's tiny ally , bhutan , is also fast improving its relations with beijing . so it was only_a_matter_of_time_before bangladesh too becomes part of the way the regional wind is now blowing .   imran_khan invites hasina_to_visit_pakistan   he also reaffirmed_pakistan 's commitment to south_asian_association_for_regional_cooperation ( saarc ) and underlined_the_importance of both countries working for enhanced regional_cooperation for sustainable_peace and prosperity .   he reiterated the invitation to prime_minister hasina_wajed to visit pakistan , the pmo said . however bangladesh 's pm visiting pakistan in foreseeable_future will be a major regional development , this is something new_delhi will try_its_best to prevent . india has invested lot of political capital in creating distances between pakistan and bangladesh   two Siamese twins separated by indian intervention in 1971 . however saarc was a creation_of_bangladesh and pakistan and before sheikh_hasina returned to power in dhaka , pakistan and bangladesh had come closer to each_other despite the tragic_events of 1971 .   bangladesh elections 2018 were controversial   when ms. wajed became the pm of bangladesh again in 2018 , there was much doubt over the fairness of the elections .   had promised the election would be free , fair and all - inclusive . weeks before the election , however , opposition party candidates began reporting attacks by supporters of the ruling_awami_league party .   opposition candidates filed hundreds of complaints with election authorities , alleging ruling_party supporters were not allowing them to carry_out their campaigns .   video_clips , which claimed to show al leaders violently threatening opposition party supporters to stay_away_from polling_places , circulated in social_media during the run
the sino - iran agreement : a regional game - changer ? shift of power in the usa : biden centre of global focus   us strategy against the rise of china in the south_china_sea   the challenges of hybrid_warfare to the national_security of pakistan and its counter strategies   the temple controversy : the state of hindu_minority in pakistan   the new_york_times recently reported that china and iran are in a process of negotiating a long - term bilateral_cooperation agreement . the proposed agreement stretches back to president_xi_jinping 's state visit to tehran in 2016 during which the vision for sino - iran cooperation was agreed . both states decided_to_expand trade over 10 years whilst also agreeing to enhance_cooperation as part of a longer 25 - year plan . although details have not been officially_released in the public_domain , an 18 - page draft of the proposed agreement reported by the new_york_times suggests that the deal encompasses a comprehensive economic and political dimension that has the potential for major strategic ramifications and mark a significant_shift for china , iran , and the wider_region .   the agreement will supposedly result in $_400_billion of chinese investment in iran over 25 years . as part of the agreement , iran will grant china significant discounts on oil_and_gas with the ability to delay payments for up to a period_of_two_years ( iran holds the second - largest natural_gas and the fifth - largest crude_oil reserves in the world ) . china will also have the added benefit of paying for the energy_resources in soft currencies . this would ensure that china has access to a regular , large , and secure source of energy at a discounted_rate .   in exchange , china will invest and expand_its_presence in the iranian banking , telecommunications , ports , and railways sectors and therefore address iran 's growing financial and infrastructural needs in addition to investing in dozens of other projects . this will give iran much - needed investment into key_sectors of an iranian economy that are in desperate need of an upgrade following the u.s. led economic_sanctions over its nuclear_programme . china has already defied u.s. sanctions by continuing to buy iranian_oil which has seen china emerge as a major iranian trading_partner and oil importer over the course of the last_decade . the proposed agreement will , therefore , be viewed as a major long - term investment to further_enhance and deepen_bilateral cooperation at a time of need for iran .   from a regional perspective , the agreement may also be seen as a strategic move to counter the warming ties_between long - term iranian ally and china 's regional_rival , india , and iran 's staunch enemy and china 's global rival , the united_states . although the united_states has dominated the middle_east for decades

( xinhua )   a revolutionary , cognition - subverting next_generation fighter_jet , characterized_by long - range , high capabilities in penetration , awareness , firepower and fast decision - making , is about to come into being amid great_power_competition , according to a recent paper by the chief designer of china 's j-20 stealth_fighter jet .   artificial_intelligence is a key field to help pilots process vast information and make decisions in complicated battlefield environments , it said .   amid great_power_competition and the commissioning of more and more fourth_generation fighter_jets ( or fifth_generation under us classification , which_includes china 's j-20 , us ' f-22 and f-35 ) , there have been extensive_discussions on the changes in types of warfare , and the development of post - fourth_generation fighter_jets , said yang wei of aviation_industry_corporation_of_china ( avic ) , in a paper_published in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica , a chinese monthly journal on aeronautics , last_month .   yang is the chief designer of china 's first fourth_generation fighter_jet , the j-20 .   in the paper , yang said that in older generations of fighter_jets , maneuverability used to be the deciding_factor , but this concept is becoming outdated with the development of advanced medium - range air - to - air missiles with their beyond - visual - range attack capabilities .   information has now become the deciding_factor , as modern fighter_jets focus on gaining more information with the help of aesa radars and data chains , while also reducing opponents ' ability to gain information , including using stealth technology and electronic countermeasures .   when aircraft can get more information with these advanced devices , pilots must have extensive knowledge , sharp analysis and sound decision - making to put them to use .   yang said artificial_intelligence will help pilots process the information , and help them become mission objective - oriented .   each step in the original observe - orient - decide - act ( OODA ) loop in the air_combat decision - making process will feature artificial_intelligence 's assistance , the paper said .

( xinhua / pan ying )   urumqi , july 24 ( xinhua ) -- while few plants can withstand the ravages of a desert , a special breed of saltbush is thriving around Taklimakan , china 's largest desert located in the southern part of xinjiang_uygur_autonomous_region .   in the outskirts of Haitiqi village in hotan county , hotan prefecture , some 50 mu ( about 3.3 hectares ) of grey - green densely branching shrubs as tall as one meter stand in sharp_contrast to the beige landscape .   known as the four - wing saltbush due to its wing - shaped fruit , the plant , which grows well in saline or alkaline soil , is gaining_popularity in south xinjiang as a desirable choice for desertification prevention_and_control .   " it also serves as a kind of nutritious feed for livestock , " said Memtimin Metiniyaz , a local villager who just collected some four - wing saltbush from the sandy land to feed his 15 sheep .

hr says talent is crucial for performanceand the pandemic proves it five talent - management_practices can help steer organizations through new ways of working and into the post - covid-19 era .   to say that chief hr officers   ( CHROs ) are busy in the covid-19 era would be an_understatement . now , more_than_ever , they are central to how companies are reimagining their personnel practices to build organizational resilience and drive value .   in the earliest days of the crisis , CHROs kept people safe while fostering connectivity and caring in an intensely stressful time . in planning for and implementing the restart , they have been working   to maintain morale and productivity   for remote workforces while trying_to_figure_out_how and when to get folks back into office settings .   those responses were to circumstances that no one had ever faced before . now , though , the covid-19 crisis is accelerating preexisting trends in five areas of talent management that are part of the CHRO playbook : finding and hiring the right people , learning and growing , managing and rewarding performance , tailoring the employee experience , and optimizing workforce planning and strategy . in this article , we look at how CHROs can take action in those areas to craft a strong and durable talent strategy for the postpandemic world .   finding and hiring the right people   during the covid-19 crisis , changes in customer demand have caused a temporary spike in hiring in areas such as grocery while leading to massive_layoffs in sectors such as hospitality . even with those shifts and an overall rise in unemployment , efficient_and_effective hiring will continue to be importantespecially for the scarce skills required for the next normal in areas such as it .   in may 2020 , we surveyed more_than_190 chief officers and functional leaders across industries to find out how they were thinking_about spending allocation in the months_ahead . of those leaders , 67_percent say they anticipate spending less on permanent hiring in the next_12_months ( exhibit_1 ) .   while some of that decline is related to a reduction in labor demand , organizations are also rethinking their hiring processes more_broadly . for example , given successful experiments in remote hiring during the covid-19 crisis , companies are reconsidering the need to go on campus for interviews ( which would admittedly be more difficult now , with many colleges_and_universities planning to use remote_learning in the fall ) . that is an acceleration of a preexisting trend : companies such as goldman_sachs were using remote interviewing for on - campus hiring before the pandemic . we expect that trend to continue in the postpandemic era .   in addition , temporary labor , which shrank faster_than overall jobs did

china consulate fight shows trump 's hardliners are in charge pompeo , aides increasingly winning battles over u.s. policy   secretary_of_state to address china in speech at nixon library   pompeo says u.s. will protect american interests from china   donald_trump spent the first three years of his presidency balancing the demands of   rs who wanted a crackdown on china against his own desire to pursue a trade_deal and cultivate a stronger relationship with xi_jinping .   the unexpected order wednesday to close the chinese_consulate in houston made one thing clear : the hawks are now in charge .   eager to blame china for the covid-19 pandemic and fed_up_with what u.s. officials call a history of espionage and intellectual - property theft , trump has allowed a small group of advisers led by secretary_of_state_michael_pompeo to push u.s. policy toward its most antagonistic in decades . the result is a series of sanctions , restrictions and condemnations that culminated in the houston decision .   " despite the overall message that the administration was tough on china we saw very much the opposite until we had a pandemic to contend_with , " said mira Rapp - Hooper , a senior_fellow with the council_on_foreign_relations . " they actually pursued a very narrow china policy up until spring . "   the battle has now been opened on a range of fronts : china 's tightening_grip over hong_kong , its treatment of muslims_in_xinjiang , its infiltration of technology and the theft of intellectual_property . in nearly every policy realm , the u.s. is pushing back harder . it 's banning_chinese academics and expelling chinese journalists and warning that the u.s. needs to cut its dependence_on_chinese goods .   pompeo 's team , along with deputy_national_security_adviser matt pottinger , are the key architects of the change . they 're finding a more willing audience in the white_house for their argument that the u.s. needs to strike back after what they see as decades spent ignoring china 's behavior , criticizing both republican and democratic administrations for being naive .   according to one person_familiar_with internal discussions , pompeo and his in - house advisers have come to conclude that a capitalist , democratic u.s. and a communist , unelected leadership in china are fundamentally at odds and can not coexist .

sherry_rehman calls for prioritizing cpec ventures chairing the meeting_of_the_special_committee on china_pakistan_economic_corridor ( cpec ) , parliamentary_leader of the ppp in the senate , senator   asked if the news about cpec losing its lead ministry to the authority is true .   " it has come to our attention that some important changes are under_consideration on how the cpec_authority will be run . we hear that the planning minister will be removed from lead_roles to be replaced by the cpec chairman , and various new powers will be given to the cpec_authority . there should be more clarity on this as this news was not refuted .   if this is indeed true then why are the powers of the planning minister being limited ?   is it because of lack of performance ?   what is the role of the prime_minister in this ?   will cpec_authority not be under_the_supervision of any ministry ? "   she questioned the senator said , " the purpose of the authority was to coordinate better between 16 ministries that are involved in the inter - ministerial coordination . the lapses in the project occur due to mismanagement and lack of strategic planning . either way it is important to establish strong ministerial capacity and leadership in moving projects forward with inclusion and transparency . " she added .   while discussing the need for developing stronger partnerships among provinces , and noting slowness in projects in balochistan , she said , " the province of balochistan is close to our_hearts and all the projects under_the_umbrella of cpec are important for development " .   she highlighted_the_importance of gawadar in cpec , and said , " the city of gawadar and the province of balochistan would not only thrive but the trade and economic_activities would leave a positive_impact on the overall development of the country .   the operationalisation of gwadar_port and completion of advancement ventures within the city would be a enormous accomplishment for the area " . " cpec is an vital stage for pakistan and all parties stand joined together on it . it is crucial that the territories are taken into certainty as their organization is of gigantic significance , " she added .   the committee was briefed that 19 ventures were completed , 28 were beneath implementation and 41 were within the pipeline . the cpec chairman guaranteed the committee that all ventures will_be_completed on time inside the stipulated and given timelines as they were finished at the time of marking understandings .   parliamentary_leader of the ppp in the senate , senator   concluded by emphasizing the need for expediting work on the various projects_related to power_generation , agriculture , science_and_technology and communication infrastructure .

do_n't fear electromagnetic pulses , fear nuclear oblivion electromagnetic pulses are the last thing ...   one of america 's weirdest strategic obsessions wo_n't go away .   a surface test of a nuclear_device in nevada circa 1955 shows the beginning of a mushroom_cloud .   it is hard to pinpoint what , specifically , the electromagnetic pulse did to the electronic infrastructure of hiroshima , japan , on aug. 6 , 1945 . in the days and months after the blast , the first use of a nuclear_weapon in war , electrical_power remained out in the city . if no specific attention_was_paid to the particular way that part of a nuclear blast interacts_with the electrical grid , it is because the effect of the weapon was total and horrific . amid the rubble , the radiation , the fire and ruin and mass death , fried electronics were barely noticed .   the electromagnetic pulse that comes from the sundering of an atom , potentially destroying electronics within the blast radius with some impact miles_away from ground_zero , is just one of many effects of every nuclear blast . what is peculiar about these pulses , often_referred_to_as EMPs , is the way the side effect of a nuclear blast is treated as a special threat in its_own right by bodies such as the task_force on national and homeland_security , which , despite the official - sounding name , is a privately funded group . these groups continue a decadelong tradition of obsession over EMPs , one president_donald_trump and others have   . these emp - specific fears are wholly divorced from the normal risk calculations of a war between nuclear - armed states and the threat of nuclear oblivion . doing so obscures the historyand misunderstands the dangers .   EMPs were anticipated before they existed . Enrico Fermi of the manhattan project   at the trinity test site so that the detonation would remain useful science . later nuclear_tests would look at the way this pulse risked disabling other warheads in flight , and what_would_happen_if a warhead was detonated so high above earth that the pulse was its primary effect .   for the early planners of the apocalypse , the greatest_risk posed_by an emp was to nuclear_warheads themselves . strategic planning called for multiple warheads to obliterate a city , and the engineers were worried_about what might happen if the first nuke to explode disabled the electronics inside the other warheads , causing them to land inert instead . this was called "   , " and researchers at the lawrence Livermore national laboratory ran monte carlo simulations to estimate the odds .   once understood , the problem of nuclear_weapons disabling other nuclear_weapons was solved , primarily , by engineering around the known parameters of EMPs

what makes AsiaPacific 's generation z different ? , thomas Rdiger smith , and   gen Zers in the AsiaPacific region are n't like their older siblings . here is what_you_need_to_know .   are coming of age .   by_2025 , the group will make up a quarter of the AsiaPacific ( apac ) region 's populationthe same as millennials ( born 19801995 ) . and as gen Zers mature , they will make and spend more money . although gen Zers share many qualities with millennials , it 's wrong to think of them simply as a younger version . generation z has its_own unique characteristics . for one thing , unlike millennials , gen Zers are entering_into adulthood during a global_pandemic . still , the demographics are clear : by_2025 , the two cohorts will compose half of apac consumers .   in an effort to understand the distinctive ways that gen Zers research , consider , purchase , and use products , in the second_half_of_2019 mckinsey surveyed more_than_16,000 consumers in six countriesAustralia , china , indonesia , japan , south_korea , and thailand .   about 3,000 generation z consumers responded in each country except thailand , where there were around 1,000 respondents .   then we compared results across three generationsGen Zers , millennials , and gen Xers ( born 19651979 ) . the survey asked respondents about their general attitudes_toward brands , shopping , digital , and media , as_well_as their outlook on the world . it also asked specific questions_about shopping habits and brands for selected categories ( exhibit_1 ) .   in this article , we describe the consumer trends that are shaping the behavior of gen Zers , the six broad segments that describe them , and how companies can reach them .   gen Zers in apac : five consumer trends   obviously , there are massive differences among the six surveyed countries in their population profile ( aging japan versus more youthful indonesia ) , economics ( australia 's gdp per head is several times that of thailand ) , and history_and_culture . in specific_areas , china shows tendencies that set it apart . nevertheless , we were able to come to five broad conclusions about apac 's gen Zers :   they rely_on social_media but are thoughtful about how they engage with it .   they want it alland are used to getting it .   they prefer brands that show their personality and uniqueness but that are also well_known enough to be recognized .   they are greatly influenced in their brand selection by video content .   they want to be seen as environmentally conscious , but they often do_n't_want to pay for this .   they rely_on social_media but are thoughtful
pompeo_urges more_assertive approach to ' frankenstein ' china pompeo_urges more_assertive approach to ' frankenstein ' china   washington ( reuters ) - u.s. secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo took fresh aim at china on thursday and said washington and its allies must use " more creative and assertive ways " to press the chinese_communist_party to change its ways , calling it the " mission of our time . "   speaking at the nixon library in president_richard_nixon 's birthplace in Yorba linda , california , pompeo said the former u.s. leader 's worry_about what he had done by opening the world to china 's communist_party in the 1970s had been prophetic .   nixon , who died in 1994 and was president from 1969 - 74 , opened the way for the establishment of u.s. diplomatic_relations with communist china in 1979 through a series of contacts , including a visit to beijing in 1972 .   in a major speech_delivered after washington 's surprise order this week for china to close its houston consulate , pompeo called_for_an_end to " blind engagement " with china and repeated frequently leveled u.s. charges about its unfair trade practices , human_rights_abuses and efforts to infiltrate american society .   he said china 's military had became " stronger and more menacing " and the approach to beijing should be " distrust and verify , " adapting president_ronald_reagan 's " trust but verify " mantra about the soviet_union in the 1980s .   " the truth is that our policies   and those of other free nations   resurrected china 's failing economy , only to see beijing bite the international hands that were feeding it , " pompeo said .   " the freedom - loving nations of the world must induce china to change ... in more creative and assertive ways , because beijing 's actions threaten our people and our prosperity . "   recalling remarks he made after meeting british leaders in london this week , pompeo said " maybe it 's time for a new grouping of like - minded nations , a new alliance of democracies , " while adding : " if the free world does_n't change , communist china will surely change us .

" pakistan took two_weeks to inform us about this ordinance and shared the copy of the ordinance only after india requested for the same , " srivastava said .   india , he added , has conveyed that the ordinance neither fulfils nor does it give complete weight to the judgment_of_the_icj .   " with regard to the ordinance , it seems , pakistan was non - serious in its approach and was not interested in implementing the judgment_of_the_icj in letter_and_spirit , " the government spokesperson said .   the whole_exercise_of_not_providing any document related to the case_even_after_repeated_requests , not providing an unimpeded_consular_access and some_reported_unilateral_action_of_approaching the high_court on part of pakistan_again_exposes_the_farcical_nature of

XXVII , no . 05   a picture dated_april 1 2007 , shows pakistan 's first deep_sea_port in gwadar   why do you oppose the china - pakistan economic_corridor ? it 's a huge project that will certainly benefit pakistan .   what is in pakistan 's interest is not_necessarily in the interest of balochistan . if_you_want to pass through balochistan , use its coast and extract its minerals , the baloch people are the main_stakeholders . their interest should come first .   there is already some resentment_among the baloch , especially in the dealings_with the chinese . how they sidelined the baloch people in Sandak is an indication of what_will_happen . according to fazle haider ( a well_known_journalist ) there_will_be_no copper , gold or silver left when the chinese will leave . they have extended their lease until 2017 .   my point is that we should keep_in_mind the interest of balochistan . the wishes of the local people should be held supreme . china is not coming to balochistan to help the baloch people , but because of its_own_interests .   but wo_n't there be a lot of new jobs for the baloch people if the gwadar_port is developed and the economic_zones along the route become operational ?   i 'm_sure you have heard that story   a poor man found a magic lamp ; he told the genie to make him a large palace , then put some rich people in it , and then asked to be made the security_guard of the palace .   the baloch do_not_want to be security_guards of someone_else 's palace . dr_abdul malik baloch ( the chief_minister of balochistan ) may get us some meager jobs . but there is a saying that freedom in poverty is better_than prosperous slavery .   this is not an issue of jobs . the baloch say it is our land . it was ours when it was desolate . now that they have discovered gold , silver and copper , it is ours .   there_will_be_no copper , gold or silver left when the chinese will leave   and what do the baloch people say about the recent debate over the route of the project ?   it is not about the route . we have apprehensions about the entire project . we have apprehensions about the future of gwadar , from where the route will emerge . we have apprehensions regardless_of_whether the road_passes_through larkana and Ratodhero , or zhob or dera_ismail_khan . the road to gwadar will pass through balochistan , and so the interests of balochistan are at_stake .

xi plans to control pak 's political economy through the cpec -ani authority xi plans to control pak 's political economy through the cpec -ani authority   hong_kong , july_26 ( ani ): over the years china has made several efforts to take full control of pakistan 's political and economic_affairs .   since 2016 , president_xi_jinping has pushed the china - pakistan china economic_corridor ( cpec ) and cpec authorities who will bring the country 's infrastructure_projects and power_plants under its direct control .   according to an article by ali_salman Andani published in the asia times , khan , a puppet of a military company , was able to manipulate the law to fulfill xi 's desire to control the pakistan ministry of planning .   " i consider the ministry of planning , development_and_special_initiative of pakistan as one of the most_important state_institutions , whose senior_bureaucrats can implicitly examine and oppose the cruel cpec scheme xi , because they have access to all confidential_documents in the agreement and are involved , directly_and_indirectly , in the decision_making_process , " Andani argues .   " as long as the control is under the control of civil institutions led by representatives of the people and civil_servants , overall responsibility for xi 's master_plan is at_least at a certain level and at a certain point of time   if not all at once   it is possible . leaving civilian institutions at all will allow xi to play on both_sides of the board , " he said .   Andani said , " xi does_not_want the belt_and_road_initiative or its components to be_held_accountable or facing_resistance . he knows that china 's dream of indoctrination of the majority of free people in the world by_2050 will not be fulfilled if people from affected countries . bri knows about its strategy to destroy their future and their future_generations . "   the cpec_authority will also have constitutional power to initiate investigations or even impose sentences on holders of public office , including the prime_minister and the president of pakistan , or those who are directly_or_indirectly involved in activities related to cpec intentionally reject directives , instructions or certain orders .   Andani said , adding , " even the prime_minister 's power will be limited to what is specified in the 2020 cpec_authority bill . so he must also obey xi 's orders . "   " the truth is that xi is weighing on these countries in debt_traps while they are already_suffering_from an intense balance_of_payments_crisis . xi will slowly poison pakistan and other poor economies by creating extreme shortages of foreign_reserves . in the end , these countries " must accept the invasion of their political and economic system by the chinese_communist_party , " he said .   the author believes that

's 5_g_network , suspended an extradition_treaty with hong_kong and offered refuge for millions of eligible hong_kongers who feel_threatened by beijing 's tightening_grip on the semi - autonomous city .

disposal of any corruption_case in 30 days not possible , nab_chairman tells supreme_court nab_chairman_javed_iqbal has stated that 120 additional accountability_courts needed to be established in lahore , karachi , rawalpindi/ islamabad and balochistan . -- file_photo   chairman_nab_justice ( retd ) javed_iqbal on saturday informed the supreme_court that it is impossible to conclude a corruption_reference within a 30 - day time_frame due to a lack of accountability_courts to adjudicate a high number_of_cases .   the reply was submitted today in response to the directions_issued_by chief_justice_of_pakistan_gulzar_ahmed to the government to form 120_new_accountability_courts so all the pending national_accountability_bureau ( nab ) cases could be wrapped_up within_three_months .   the cjp had asked the law secretary to set_up new courts after_getting_approval_from the competent_authorities . the court had also sought_suggestions_from the nab_chairman for the expeditious_disposal of pending references .   in a response submitted to the sc , the nab chief said the anti - graft_body had multiple_times conveyed these issues to the government that the accountability_courts are unable_to_meet the legal_requirements due to a shortage of courts and judges .   " that under_section 16(a ) of the national_accountability_ordinance , 1999 a timeframe of 30 x days is set for conclusion of trial by the court and it is required to conduct proceedings on day - to - day basis . however , with the present strength of accountability_courts and the workload of cases pending_adjudication before each accountability_court , ( on average each accountability_court is currently handling 50 x references ) , it practically is impossible to adjudicate and finalize matters within 30 x days . "   he also stated that stay_orders issued by the high_courts in petitions_filed_by the accused are also one of the reasons_behind the backlog in the disposal of cases .   the former sc_judge maintained that the courts do not follow the rules laid_down by the supreme_court in granting bails , adding that the process_to_declare an accused as absconder is also time - consuming .   the delay in mutual_legal_assistance from destinations is also cited as one of the reasons .   he informed the court that due to the wrong definition of ' politically_exposed personalities ' by the courts it_becomes_difficult to explain this to the foreign agencies .   the nab_chairman stated that 120 additional accountability_courts needed to be established in lahore , karachi , rawalpindi/ islamabad and balochistan .   " if district_and_sessions_judges are not available then retired_judges can be hired for the purpose . "   a three - member_bench of the apex_court_comprising_chief_justice gulzar_ahmed , justice_mazhar_alam_khan_miankhel and justice_yahya_afridi , had asked the authorities to form 120 courts during the hearing of a case regarding the delay in the trial of cases by the accountability_courts in the light of section 16 of the national_accountability_ordinance , 1999 requiring a decision of nab cases within_30_days .

" of course , a threat of war with china itself would be an unimaginable catastrophe , " he said .

farage : ' the chinese state has conducted murder on a vast scale ' farage : ' the chinese state has conducted murder on a vast scale '   nigel_farage said that it is time for western_nations to stand up to the chinese_communist_party ( ccp ) for the horrors the regime is committing against the uyghur people in xinjiang , which he described as a " stain on the world " .   the brexit party_leader said that he , alongside other sino - skeptics , may have focussed too_much on the economic and security risks_posed_by the chinese state , rather_than the humanitarian atrocities_committed_against the uyghur_muslims in xinjiang and the falun_gong spiritual movement at the hands of the chinese_communist_party .

"   " i_am not alone . over the last couple of decades , the western world and its media have given very little attention to human_rights_abuses in china . as_a_result of this , most people who are quite happy to buy competitively priced goods from that country simply do_n't_realize the breadth of the crimes_against_humanity for which the chinese regime is responsible , " mr farage wrote .   addressing the mass_internment of uyghurs muslims in concentration_camps , the forced sterilisation , and mass brainwashing to " join the cult of hero - worshiping president_xi_jinping " , mr farage said : " while it is true that some uighurs are responsible for terrorist reprisals in response to the crackdown by the chinese authorities , nothing can excuse what the chinese state has done to these people . "   " the time has come for the west to address this stain on the world , " he proclaimed .   i will never understand_why   could ask people to sign this petition to legally recognise the uighur_muslim genocide , while lib dem leadership candidates   ignored my repeated public pleas to do so on here while i was on silent hunger_strike   mr farage 's pronouncement comes as united_states secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo flew_to_london to meet

india silently upgrades taiwan ties fri , jul 24 , 2020 page8   india silently upgrades taiwan ties   one of the consequences of india 's face - off with china in the galwan_valley in its ladakh_region last_month   chinese_soldiers_killed 20 unarmed indian_soldiers with iron_rods and clubs_studded_with iron nails   is that india is upgrading and intensifying its ties_with_taiwan . this is reflected , as a first step , in the appointment of a top career_diplomat as india 's representative to taiwan .   because india and taiwan do not maintain formal_diplomatic_ties , due to india 's adherence to a " one china " policy , new_delhi and taipei use different nomenclatures for their missions .   india 's representation in taipei is officially_known_as the india - taipei association .   notwithstanding its " one - china " policy , india is looking_at_ways to strengthen its ties_with_taiwan . india 's new envoy to taipei , joint_secretary Gourangalal das , headed the us division in india 's ministry_of_external_affairs and succeeds Sridharan Madhusudhanan , who is also a senior career_diplomat   das ' widely publicized appointment poses a sharp_contrast to the quiet appointments of past representatives to taiwan and comes soon after india 's grueling face - off with china .   indian politicians and officials are no_longer shy of openly calling for intensifying ties_with_taiwan , not only in economic and trade terms , but also in cultural and social terms . technological , medical and scientific cooperation , and tourism are areas both_sides could also promote . people - to - people contacts are expected to get a strong boost .   buddhism and Taoism evoke considerable interest among many indians who speak of ancient connections with chinese spiritualism , which is seen as preserved in taiwan , but suppressed in china .   the killing_of_20_soldiers   at_a_time_when chinese_president_xi_jinping 's ( ) conduct was severely criticized in india , as elsewhere in the world , for the scandalous cover - up of the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan   has further infuriated indians , who are urging indian_prime_minister_narendra_modi to disregard china 's sensitivity over taiwan and upgrade ties with the latter .   das ' appointment demonstrates that india attaches_great_importance to its ties_with_taiwan , which has become a much sought - after economic partner , but also as a source of investment and technology .   intensifying business ties_with_taiwan would also reduce india 's dependence_on_chinese electronics and communication supplies .   taiwan sees india as a key_partner in its new southbound policy , which focuses_on developing its ties with south_and_southeast_asia .   it has also appointed a seasoned_diplomat , department of east_asian_and_pacific_affairs director - general Baushuan Ger ( ) as its new representative to india , replacing tien chung - kwang ( ) who headed

covid-19 and gender_equality : countering the regressive effects what is good for gender_equality is good for the economy and society as well . the covid-19 pandemic puts that truth into stark relief and raises critically_important choices .   to affect lives_and_livelihoods around the world , we can already see that the pandemic and its economic_fallout are having a regressive effect on gender_equality . by our calculation , women 's jobs are 1.8 times more vulnerable to this crisis than men 's jobs . women make up 39_percent of global employment but account for 54_percent of overall job_losses . one reason for this greater effect on women is that the virus is significantly increasing the burden of unpaid care , which is disproportionately carried by women . this , among other factors , means that women 's employment is dropping faster_than average , even accounting for the fact that women and men work in different_sectors .   given trends we have observed over the past_few_months , in a gender - regressive scenario in which no action is taken to counter these effects , we estimate that global gdp_growth could be $_1_trillion lower in 2030 than it would be if women 's unemployment simply tracked that of men in each sector . ( it is important_to_note that the impact could be more severe than the one we have modeled here if factors_such_as increased childcare burdens , attitudinal bias , a slower recovery , or reduced public_and_private spending on services such as education or childcare make women leave the labor_market permanently . ) conversely , taking_action now to advance gender_equality could be valuable , adding $ 13 trillion to global gdp in 2030 compared with the gender - regressive scenario . a middle pathtaking action only after the crisis has subsided rather_than nowwould reduce the potential opportunity by more_than $_5_trillion . the cost of that delay amounts to three - fourths of the total global gdp we c

bilawal accuses imran_khan of giving_nro to indian_spy_kulbhushan_jadhav ppp_chairman_bilawal_bhutto_zardari alleged on thursday that the pti_government and prime_minister_imran_khan were trying to give " concessions similar to the national_reconciliation_ordinance [ nro ] " to the convicted_indian_spy_kulbhushan_jadhav .   in a thunderous speech in the national_assembly , where a recent ordinance related to indian_spy_jadhav 's appeal against military court_verdict was being discussed , bilawal said that the prime_minister , since day one , has been saying that he will_not_give_nro to anyone .   " the number of nros pm_imran gave , no dictator or leader has [ ever ] given in the history of pakistan , " said the ppp_leader , adding that when the senate took_up_the_matter of the indian_spy , the government issued_an_ordinance in_this_regard .   he also responded to an earlier statement of pti senator and minister_shireen_mazari , who said that the pti ( when in opposition ) had taken a stance against accepting the jurisdiction of the international_court_of_justice in the case .   " if you are not acknowledging the jurisdiction of the international courts that does_not_mean you give_nro through the pakistani laws to an indian_spy , " retorted bilawal , as the opposition_members thumped their desks in approval .   bilawal said that pti minister_murad_saeed came forward in the defence of the indian_spy , saying that the party will not accept the government 's ordinance regarding jadhav 's appeal .   on wednesday , the government had approached_the_islamabad_high_court to appoint_a_legal_representative for indian_spy_kulbhushan_jadhav .   ' nro given to ehsanullah_ehsan '   bilawal also lambasted the pti_government , saying that the government also gave nro to tehreek - e - taliban pakistan terrorist_ehsanullah_ehsan .   " they have given nro to ehsanullah_ehsan , they have released him , " he said .   the ppp_leader said that when the news of the terrorist 's release surfaced , he had submitted a question in the house asking about the ttp member 's release , however , till_date he has not receive an answer to his query .   " the answer for ( the sake of martyred ) aps students needs to be given , " he said .   bilawal said that pm_imran has never spoken_out_against terrorists in his speeches .   the ppp_chairman then spoke_about the national_accountability_bureau , saying that the institution should carry_out accountability without discrimination .   bilawal called for the formation of a new body that holds both the government and opposition_members accountable . " there should be an institution that holds judges and generals accountable as well , " he added .   a day earlier in a press_conference , bilawal had called for the shutting_down of nab , saying that the chairman justice ( retd ) javed_iqbal should " pack up and go home " .

pakistan 's stunning flattening of covid-19 curve this story appears_to_be good to be true to the seasoned scepticism of the pakistani mind   sometimes it feels_like imran_khan and pakistan have been saved from a coronavirus catastrophe by a selector in the heavens . the speed with which pakistan flattened its covid-19 curve   defying all local and international projections   is a feat that even aliens can not deliver . it 's nothing short of a miracle that pakistan has pivoted from a worst - case scenario trajectory to successfully flattening_the_curve without_any widespread shortage_of_ventilators , hospital_beds or ppes .   at first , like many in the press , i bought into the narrative that the reduction in tests was driving the reduction in cases . this was quickly debunked when data_showed that the positivity_ratio has collapsed by half ( more dramatically in punjab , from 25 % to 5 % ) and the number of people hospitalised or needing ventilators is declining proportionally . this means pakistan 's progress is real . even after the number_of_tests stabilised , the number_of_cases continued_to_decline sharply . so , i gave dr_zafar_mirza , pakistan 's health minister , a call to understand what explains pakistan 's surprising flattening_of_the_curve ahead of expectations .   " first of all , it 's a fact that pakistan crossed its covid-19 peak in the middle of june , " shared dr_mirza . " even by our own estimates , we_were_expecting the peak to hit us in july or mid - august and there are a number of factors that are driving this early decline . " the two most prominent factors , according to dr_mirza , are a change in human behaviour ( pakistanis understanding the risk of covid-19 and taking_precautions seriously ) and early , effective_interventions by the government ( for example , 2,300 smart_lockdowns impacting 47 million pakistanis ) .   this story appears_to_be good to be true to the seasoned scepticism of the pakistani mind , so i pushed him on alternative explanations . what if there are other factors driving this like humidity or host genetics or cross immunity ( pakistanis take vaccines for a host of other diseases and this might build their resilience against covid-19 ) . " they may have been a factor , but we can not say conclusively , " argues dr_mirza . plus , the fact that cases in india continue_to_rise , even_though it shares most of these factors with pakistan , shows there is something unique about the way the covid-19 curve is behaving in the country .   dr_mirza detailed the more_than fifty evidence - based policy_decisions rooted in data which helped pakistan flatten_the_curve ahead of expectations . " how did you stay grounded in data when there was mass hysteria in the press and political_pressure from the
wo_n't let anyone steal money : supreme_court islamabad : the supreme_court tuesday questioned transparency in the mode of expenditure of the national_disaster_management_authority ( ndma ) while dealing_with covid-19 and locusts and said it would_not_allow_anyone_to steal money .   this observation from the apex_court came during the hearing of corona suo_motu_case by a five - member_larger_bench of the apex_court_headed_by_chief_justice of pakistan justice_gulzar_ahmed .   the chief_justice_observed that the ndma was dealing_with floods , locusts as_well_as importing machinery for preparing medical kits like n-95_masks , etc , but no documentary proof had been submitted to the court despite_repeated directions . " we have sought_details from the ndma three times but we are yet to be provided with details , " the cjp_remarked .   " you have received billions_of_rupees of funding from donor_agencies but how you are utilising it , we_do_n't_know , " the cjp told the ndma_representative .   the chief_justice_observed that it was due to rampant_corruption that pakistan was called the most_corrupt country in the world .   the cjp recalled that they had passed orders seeking reports from the ndma but these were not being complied_with .   " should we issue a contempt_of_court_notice to the ndma or ask the prime_minister to remove the organization head ? " the cjp_asked the official adding that every_aspect of the matter should_be_ensured in a transparent_manner and nobody should_be_given a specific favor .   he noted that rs10,725,000 was given in cash to a company , VisionAir , in lieu of chartering a plane adding that as per agreement , the money was to be paid in dollars and online but the payment was made in cash .   the chief_justice further said the company was even not a beneficiary adding that the ndma was favoring one company . justice_ijazul_ahsen observed that the ndma had been_given_a_free_hand but " we are concerned only to the extent of utilizing the funding in a transparent_manner so that the image of the country should not tarnish abroad .   the chief_justice noted_with_concern that the documents_submitted by the ndma were totally contradicting its claim in the report adding that the organization does_not_know_how to proceed with the court 's order and how to submit_report before it .   attorney_general_khalid_javed submitted that a notice be issued to the said party . the chief_justice also asked for documents permitting the import_of_machinery from al - hafeez Crystoplast ( pvt ) ltd.   " why court order was not complied_with by submitting the said documents despite our repeated three orders ? " the cjp inquired adding that who was the owner of the company and was yet to appear_before_the_court .   justice_ijazul_ahsen_asked as to who had paid for the machinery_imported from china and asked why the details of chartering the plane and its payments were not being submitted . director_admin ndma

the curious_case of davinder_singh table of contents - archive | 2020 lockdown editions   mainstream , vol LVIII no 31 , new_delhi , july_18 , 2020   seven months after catching jammu_and_kashmir ( j&k ) police deputy_superintendent_of_police ( dy sp ) davinder_singh escorting two alleged terrorists_belonging reportedly to hizbul_mujahideen group of pakistan , in his hyundai i10 car on the srinagar - jammu highway , the premier national investigations agency ( nia ) finally presented a charge - sheet in a nia_special_court in jammu on july_6 . curiously nearly a month before that a delhi court_granted_him bail for the failure of delhi police to file a charge_sheet_against davinder_singh .   singh was arrested on january 11 with two alleged hum terrorists naveed_babu , mushtaq rather and their overground contact and a lawyer irfan_shafi when they were stopped at a check_post while ostensibly driving down to jammu . several news_channels also reported that the hum men being escorted by davinder_singh were heading for delhi to launch one more parliament style attack in the national capital and presumably davinder_singh was in the know of it when he decided to provided them the necessary cover to facilitate their journey to delhi in his car .   from day one davinder_singh 's case was very curious and is becoming progressively curiouser by the day . the nia has now come out with the charge that davinder_singh was " in touch_with_certain_officials of the pakistan_high_commission_in_new_delhi through_secure_social_media_platforms . "   the nia_charge_sheet stated that , " the investigation_has_revealed_that the accused_were_part_of_a_deep - rooted_conspiracy_hatched_by the pakistan_based_terrorist_organisation hizbul_mujahideen and pakistan state agencies to commit_violent_acts_and_to_wage a war_against_the_union_of_india " so in effect the nia has concluded that davinder_singh was complicit in " waging_a_war against the union of india . "   but less_than_a_month ago delhi police raised no objections when davinder_singh 's counsel sought bail in new_delhi from the court of special judge Dharmender rana on the grounds that no charge_sheet_has_been_filed by the delhi police even after the prescribed limit of 90_days has passed and the police has not even sought any extension for this purpose from the court ! this apparently implied that till the date the judge granted davinder_singh bail , the other investigating_agencies like the delhi police which had registered_a_case_against davinder_singh who had been brought to delhi after his arrest had no_clue why they had put him in jail . upon davinder_singh 's arrest , the delhi police had mindlessly slapped a case that this group were actually working for mumbai 's underworld_don_dawood_ibrahim who fled after mumbai bomb_blasts of 1993 to karachi and presumably settled there .   the nia , on_the_other_hand , claimed that davinder_singh was in touch_with the pakistan embassy_officials in delhi and was surreptitiously working for pakistani terrorist_outfits for long . but since when , they wo_n't tell . but once the investigating_agencies have presumably established that davinder_singh was
cpec_projects must be prioritized , says sherry_rehman islamabad : while_chairing_the_meeting of the special committee on cpec , parliamentary_leader of the ppp in the senate , senator_sherry_rehman asked if the news about cpec losing its lead ministry to the authority is true .   " it has come to our attention that some important changes are under_consideration on how the cpec_authority will be run . we hear that the planning minister will be removed from lead_roles to be replaced by the cpec chairman , and various new powers will be given to the cpec_authority . there should be more clarity on this as this news was not refuted . if this is indeed true then why are the powers of the planning minister being limited ? is it because of lack of performance ? what is the role of the prime_minister in this ? will cpec_authority not be under_the_supervision of any ministry ? " she questioned   the senator said , " the purpose of the authority was to coordinate better between 16 ministries that are involved in the inter - ministerial coordination . the lapses in the project occur due to mismanagement and lack of strategic planning . either way it is important to establish strong ministerial capacity and leadership in moving projects forward with inclusion and transparency . " she added .   while discussing the need for developing stronger partnerships among provinces , and noting a slowness in projects in balochistan she said , " the province of balochistan is close to our_hearts and all the projects under_the_umbrella of cpec are important for development " .   rehman highlighted_the_importance of gawadar in cpec , and said , " the city of gawadar and the province of balochistan would not only thrive but the trade and economic_activities would leave a positive_impact on the overall development of the country . the operationalization of gwadar_port and completion_of_development_projects in the city would be a big_achievement for the area "   " cpec is an_important_platform for pakistan and all parties stand united on it . it is vital that the provinces are taken_into_confidence as their partnership is of immense_importance , " she added .   the committee was briefed that 19 projects_were_completed , 28 were under implementation and 41 were in the pipeline . the cpec chairman assured the committee that all projects_will_be_completed on time within_the_stipulated and given timelines as they were finalised at the time of signing agreements .   parliamentary_leader of the ppp in the senate , senator_sherry_rehman concluded by emphasizing the need for expediting work on the various projects_related to power_generation , agriculture , science_and_technology and communication infrastructure . she said , " we want cpec to progress , and the development initiatives under this project need to be made inclusive by taking all on board as it is a game_changer for the

" you put on your own first , and then we want to help others as_quickly_as_possible , " peter marks , a senior_official at the u.s. food_and_drug_administration who oversaw the initial phases of vaccine_development for the u.s. government , said during a panel_discussion in june . the major difference , of course , is that airplane oxygen_masks do not drop only in first classwhich is the equivalent of what_will_happen when vaccines eventually become available if governments delay providing access to them to people in other countries .   160 candidate_vaccines against the new coronavirus in development , with 21 in clinical_trials . although it will be months , at_least , before one or more of those candidates has been proved to be safe_and_effective and is ready to be delivered , countries that manufacture vaccines ( and wealthy ones that do not ) are already competing to lock in early access . and to judge from the way governments have acted during the current pandemic and past outbreaks , it seems highly likely that such behavior will persist . absent an international , enforceable commitment to distribute vaccines globally in an equitable and rational way , leaders will instead prioritize taking_care of their_own populations over slowing_the_spread of covid-19 elsewhere or helping protect essential health - care_workers and highly_vulnerable populations in other countries .   that sort of " vaccine_nationalism , " or a " my country first " approach to allocation , will have profound and far - reaching consequences . without global coordination , countries may bid against one another , driving up the price of vaccines and related materials . supplies of proven vaccines will be limited initially even in some rich_countries , but the greatest suffering will be in low- and middle - income countries . such places will be forced to watch as their wealthier counterparts deplete supplies and will have to wait months ( or longer ) for their replenishment . in the interim , health - care_workers and billions of elderly and other high - risk inhabitants in poorer_countries will go unprotected , which will extend the pandemic , increase its death_toll , and imperil already_fragile_health - care systems and economies . in their quest to obtain vaccines , countries without access to the initial stock will search for any form of leverage they can find , including blocking exports of critical vaccine components , which will lead to the breakdown of supply_chains for raw ingredients , syringes , and vials . desperate

gwadar_port handed_over to china from divided to united_states   of america ?   landmark handover starts new chapter of pak - china friendships   china took control monday of a strategic pakistani port on the arabian_sea , as part of a drive to secure energy and maritime routes that also gives it a potential naval_base , sparking indian concern .   the pakistani cabinet_approved the transfer of gwadar , currently a commercial failure cut_off from the national road_network , from singapore 's psa international to the state - owned china company on january 30 .   it had not been clear when the actual handover would take_place , but pakistani president_asif_ali_zardari presided_over the signing of a memorandum_of_understanding on monday that was broadcast_live by local television .   " the contract of operation of gwadar_port is formally given to china . today , the agreement is transferred from the port of singapore authority to china_overseas_ports_holding_company limited , " zardari announced .   " the award of this contract opens new opportunities for our people ... it gives new_impetus_to_pakistan - china relations . "   the pakistanis pitched the deal as offering an energy and trade corridor that would connect china to the arabian_sea and strait_of_hormuz , a gateway for a third of the world 's traded oil , overland through an expanded karakoram_highway .   experts_say it would cut thousands_of_kilometres off the distance which oil_and_gas imports from africa and the middle_east have to travel to reach china .   " gwadar_port will enhance trade_and_commerce not only between pakistan and china but also in the region , " said zardari .   china paid about 75_percent of the initial $_250_million used to build the port but in 2007 psa international won a 40 - year operating lease .   then - ruler_pervez_musharraf was reportedly unwilling to upset washington by giving control of the port to the chinese .   on february 6 indian_defence_minister a.k. antony said new_delhi was concerned by pakistan 's decision to transfer management of the deep - sea_port to china , which has interests in a string of other ports encircling india .   pakistan foreign_ministry_spokesman moazzam ahmad_khan dismissed those concerns last_week , telling reporters : " this is not something that any other country should have any reason to be concerned about . "   gwadar is part of the southwestern_province_of_baluchistan , the most deprived part of pakistan despite being rich in oil_and_gas deposits . the province is gripped by a separatist_insurgency and record_levels of sectarian_violence .   on saturday , a bomb killed 89 people in a hazara shiite_muslim neighbourhood of the provincial_capital_quetta , barely a month after twin suicide_bombers killed 92 people at a hazara snooker hall elsewhere in the city .   zardari said the building of infrastructure

' jobless phd holders to cross 3,000 mark by end of this year ' by the end of this year , the number of jobless phds in the country will cross 3,000 , the phd association of pakistan ( pap ) told the news .   expressing their concerns_over the high number of unemployed phds , pap office_bearers said the government had been paying no attention to resolve the problems_being_faced_by the phd_scholars in the country and no effective_steps had been taken by the authorities_concerned for placement of the unemployed phds in varsities and higher_educational institutes .   meanwhile , the higher_education_commission of pakistan ( hec ) chairman , dr_tariq_banuri , in a statement has said that around 45,000 non - phd faculty_members are currently employed in state - run varsities across pakistan .   neither have the universities shown the inclination to integrate unemployed phds instead of non - phds in the academia nor have the relevant_authorities taken any concrete_measures to provide_job_opportunities to them . likewise , public_and_private_sector varsities seem to prefer recruiting non - phd faculty_members in sheer_violation of the hec 's directives .   on the one hand , fresh_phds are protesting_against not getting jobs and on_the_other_hand , many educational_institutes have been hiring retired teachers on a contractual_basis and as a visiting_faculty member . this trend is not only discouraging for fresh_phds but also a clear_violation of orders of the apex_court .   " if the negligent attitude and such discouraging policies continue under which retired people are being reappointed as teachers instead of fresh and energetic phd doctors , pakistan would face a severe_shortage of phds in the future , which would hamper its academic and research progress , " said pap patron - in - chief dr sidra bajwa . she added that phd_scholars played_an_important_role in the development of any country and the number of phd doctors and research articles were the most_important factors that caused rising of varsities in the global university_rankings .   she called on the authorities to ensure the formulation and implementation of an effective policy to integrate the local and foreign qualified phds in the academia of pakistan .   the hec in 2009 initiated the interim placement of fresh_phds phase - i ( ipfp ) programme to generate_employment_opportunities for phd_scholars . the ipfp 's objectives were two - fold   providing jobs to fresh_phds and helping universities benefit from their academic and research experience .   following the ipfp 's rules , the commission placed until 2018 hundreds of fresh_phds in public_sector_universities as assistant professors for an interim_period of one year . later on , these scholars would be accommodated as a permanent faculty_member in their relevant varsities .   " through the ipfp phase - i , around 70_per_cent of phds were absorbed as a permanent faculty_member by their_respective

chinese army is full of wimps , sissies & little emperors . we are not saying this . this is what china thinks the people 's_liberation_army of china 's only justification to exist in the modern world is that they emerged victors in the chinese civil_war . apart_from that victory , there is n't really much to the pla 's credit , and that might explain chinese unwillingness to escalate_matters with any country , especially india , beyond a point , despite aggressive_posturing by the dragon on all fronts .   chinese superiority , militarily so , is a myth . china often worries_about the lack of a battle - hardened army of soldiers that can put up a tough fight . and as per military discussions on the chinese_side itself , much of the pla 's incapacity to indulge in heated armed_conflicts , stems_from the one - child policy of the communist state which has turned_out_to_be an_unmitigated_disaster for the country .   the one - child policy was brought into force in 1979 by the ccp , to curb_the_menace of a growing_population . anyone with more_than one child , post-1980 , was made to face the wrath of the tyrannical chinese state , not to mention that the second child was snatched_away from parents and dispatched to anonymity .   of the one - child policy , defence think_tanks within china are of the increasing opinion that the pla is made up of " wimps " . "   soldiers from the one - child generations are wimps who have absolutely no fighting_spirit ,   , a government publication in china .   close to 70 % of the chinese military force is comprised of single - children , with no siblings . as such , they have been brought up as pampered " little emperors " by parents_and_grandparents . having psychological impacts that growing up alone might have , there is a constant_fear among strategic quarters in china that the softness of their force would spell a death - knell for the country 's expansionist and belligerent ambitions around all of its borders . in 2015 , perhaps having smelled the coffee , china brought in the two - child policy .   however , for the said relaxations to reap_benefits would take   , at_least . going by the aggressive_posturing which the dragon is currently indulging in , with its inefficient and   military , it would n't be long before they receive a drubbing of their lifetimes . chinese families are very emotional about their child , since there 's only one . as such , millions of children grew_up believing they were " little emperors " . studies_have_shown stark   between children having siblings in china before 1980 , as opposed to those who grew_up

global hunger index 2019 : india ranked lower_than nepal , pakistan , bangladesh watch | india 's first_batch of homegrown asafoetida   india is ranked 102 of 117 countries in the global hunger index 2019 , behind its neighbours nepal , pakistan and bangladesh .   seventeen countries , including belarus , ukraine , turkey , cuba and kuwait , shared the top rank with GHI scores of less_than five , the website of the global hunger index that tracks hunger and malnutrition said . the report , prepared jointly by irish aid agency concern worldwide and german organisation Welt hunger Hilfe termed the level of hunger in india " serious " .   in 2018 , it was ranked 103 out of 119 countries . in 2000 , the country was ranked 83 out of 113 countries . now , with 117 countries in the fray , it has dropped to 102 .   its GHI score has also decelerated   from 38.9 in 2005 to 32 in 2010 and then from 32 to 30.3 between 2010 and 2019 . the GHI score is calculated on four indicators   undernourishment ; child wasting , the share of children_under_the_age_of_five who are wasted ( that is , who have low weight for their height , reflecting acute undernutrition ) ; child stunting , children_under_the_age_of_five who have low height for their age , reflecting chronic undernutrition ; and child_mortality , the mortality_rate of children_under_the_age_of_five .   the share of wasting among children in india rose from 16.5 % in the 2008 - 2012 period to 20.8 % in 2014 - 2018 , according to the report .   just 9.6 % of all children between 6 and 23 months of age are fed a " minimum acceptable diet " , it said .

punjab censors books under guise of islam and nationalism the punjab government has taken its unchecked abuse of islam and nationalism a step further , in its recent passage of the tahaffuz - e - bunyad - e - islam act which gives one governmental pr office ( public_relations ) the power to surveil and ban any local or foreign book or publication , before or after its printing , if the director_general public_relations ( dgpr ) feels it is against islam , pakistan , or pakistani culture .   the new bill grants the dgpr sweeping_powers to inspect_any_printing_press , publication house , bookshop . he also has the power to confiscate_any book whatsoever , before or after its printing , essentially giving one non - elected person control over which books or publications [ including pamphlets , booklets , digital e - books , or soft copies of any publication , and even maps and sheet music ] are available to an entire_nation of more_than_200_million_people .   bear_in_mind that sociologists who have devoted their lives to studying culture still do not agree on one universally_accepted definition . not to mention , that culture is constantly_changing- as people and societies evolve to become better versions of themselves . " pakistani culture " therefore creates a vague and all - encompassing excuse for the dgpr to ban any book or publication contrary to his personal prejudices or the political interests of his boss [ or the boss 's boss ] .   the bill , now law , also gives the dgpr a complete_record of every book or publication in the country . essentially , the dgpr not only has the power to surveil and ban any books or publications he finds disagreeable , all book publishers and printers must give him complete access to what is being written so he can take action well before a single written word reaches people .   for local books , it reads : " every publisher of books shall_be bound to provide memoranda of all books , published by him , to the authorized officer , after every three_months with other details . "   for imported books , it adds : " every importer of books shall_be bound to provide memoranda of all books imported in the province by him , within fifteen_days of import of books to the authorized officer . "   furthermore , the bill makes it compulsory for every publisher ( of local or imported publications ) to first send copies to the dgpr 's office which has the final say on what pakistanis can read and what they can not . without his approval , nothing can be published .   breaking this extremely censorious rule reminiscent of zia 's period , can lead to imprisonment of up to five_years

intelligence_failure on pla_intrusions in ladakh brings back memories of kargil the numerous flaws that the kargil_review_committee had pointed to appear to have repeated themselves .   an_indian_army_convoy_moves along_a_highway_leading_to_ladakh , at_gagangeer_in_kashmir 's ganderbal_district june_18 , 2020 . photo : reuters / danish ismail / files   it is perhaps iniquitous at_this_stage to reiterate the gross intelligence_failure by india 's security_agencies , and its army , in detecting chinese military_incursions at_multiple_points_along the line_of_actual_control ( lac ) in eastern_ladakh , as the face - off between_the_two_armies endures .   but perhaps it is not premature to believe in the imminence of an inquiry , much like in the instance of the 1999_kargil_war , into major blunders and negligence that led to the ingress by the people 's_liberation_army ( pla ) , and the consequent alarming possibility of permanently losing indian_territory to china .   after all , it appears that the numerous flaws that the kargil_review_committee ( KRC ) revealed at multiple_levels in intelligence_gathering , the army 's operational strategies and organisation , and procedural sharing of data by multiple security_agencies , persist . in a ruinous replay of kargil 21 years later , all these factors and more seem to be largely_responsible_for the current military impasse in ladakh .   according to senior security officials , the multiple agencies involved in monitoring the lac on the ground , in the air and via satellites , appear to have feebly watched the pla intrusion across the lac unfold before them .   the three broad surveillance and intelligence_gathering layers employed along_the_lac include joint_patrols by the army 's ladakh_scouts and indo - tibetan_border_police ( itbp ) personnel , imagery and signals_intelligence supplied by israeli drones , operated by the army and the indian_air_force and the third most formidable tier : dedicated military satellites .   the latter two capabilities are dispersed between the national_technical_research organisation , created in 2004 , and the tri - service directorate of signals_intelligence that operates under the ministry of defence ( mod ) and the research and analysts wing , india 's external information gathering agency .   the first level of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) is relayed to select itbp and army formations , whilst imagery from the other two is disseminated to the defence image processing and analysis centre ( DIPAC ) in new_delhi and the directorate of signals_intelligence .   in turn , it is further dispersed to various intelligence_agencies , but particularly to the army 's directorate of military_operations and the analogous directorate of military_intelligence ( DMI ) , whose primary task is to provide timely , relevant , accurate and synchronised intelligence support to back the forces tactical , operational and strategic - level requirements .

temporary basic_income to protect the world 's poorest people could slow the surge in covid-19 cases , says undp find our offices around the world   get_in_touch , share your ideas , and discover how we can work_together for a sustainable , just , and equitable future .   posted on july_23 , 2020   many of the huge_numbers of people not covered by social insurance programmes are informal_workers , low - waged , women and young people , refugees_and_migrants , and people_with_disabilities   and they are the ones hardest_hit by this crisis . photo : undp bangladesh / fahad Kaizer   new_york the immediate introduction of a temporary basic_income for the world 's poorest people could slow the current surge in covid-19 cases by enabling nearly three billion people to stay_at_home , according to a united_nations_development_programme ( undp ) report_released today .   temporary basic_income : protecting poor_and_vulnerable people in developing_countries   estimates that it would cost from $ 199 billion_per_month to provide a time - bound , guaranteed basic_income to the 2.7_billion people living below or just above the poverty_line in 132 developing_countries .   the report_concludes that the measure is feasible and urgently_needed , with the pandemic now spreading at a rate of more_than 1.5_million new cases per week , particularly in developing_countries , where seven out of ten workers make a living through informal markets and can not earn_money if they are at home .   many of the huge_numbers of people not covered by social insurance programmes are informal_workers , low - waged , women and young people , refugees_and_migrants , and people_with_disabilities   and they are the ones hardest_hit by this crisis . undp has carried_out assessments on the socio - economic_effects of covid-19 in more_than_60 countries in the past_few_months and the evidence_shows that workers who are not covered by social_protection can not stay_at_home without an income .   a temporary basic_income would give them the means to buy_food and pay for health and education expenses . it is also financially within reach : a six - month temporary basic_income , for example , would require just 12 percent of the total financial response to covid-19 expected in 2020 , or the equivalent of one - third of what developing_countries owe in external_debt payments in 2020 .   " unprecedented_times call for unprecedented social and economic measures . introducing a temporary basic_income for the world 's poorest people has emerged as one option . this might have seemed impossible just a few_months_ago , " said undp administrator Achim steiner .

farooq_abdullah calls for restoration_of_statehood to jammu_and_kashmir , pins hopes on sc for ' justice ' farooq_abdullah calls for restoration_of_statehood to jammu_and_kashmir , pins hopes on sc for ' justice '   national_conference_president_farooq_abdullah .   as the revocation_of_jammu_and_kashmir 's special_status is set to complete one year on august_5 , former chief_minister farooq_abdullah on sunday called for restoration of its statehood and hoped the supreme_court would render justice by striking down the repeal_of_article_370 provisions .   these changes were a " betrayal " of the trust reposed by the people of jammu_and_kashmir when the state acceded to the union of india , he said .   the centre had abrogated_the_special_status on_august_5_last_year , saying article_370 had stalled the development of jammu_and_kashmir , prevented proper education , health_care and growth of industries besides not helping in curbing terrorism .   the national conference ( nc ) , of which abdullah is the president , has mounted a legal_challenge in the supreme_court to the abrogation_of_article_370 and carving_out of two_union_territories of jammu_and_kashmir , and ladakh from the erstwhile_state .   the legislation_passed by parliament and the subsequent orders issued by the president were " unconstitutional " , it has submitted in the apex_court which has set_up a five - member_bench to hear the matter .   " as a political_party it is but natural that we will keep the people informed about what_we_are_doing to get justice . we are very_clear that we_do_not_accept the changes forced on us and will continue to oppose them , " said the veteran leader who was arrested hours before article_370 provisions were scrapped on august_5 and spent over seven months in detention .   abdullah , who has served three terms as the border state 's chief_minister , said , " we will fight for our rights , campaign for our rights within democratic means . we have never used guns , we have never used methods which are not constitutional . we are a democratic mainstream party and will use all democratic means at our disposal . "   describing the changes as " vishwasghat " ( betrayal of trust ) reposed by people of jammu_and_kashmir at the time of accession , he said , " the trust we had reposed in delhi has come to nought . "   " there is a loss of trust and delhi has to rebuild the trust . that trust will come only when the statehood is restored and other changes are reversed . that has to be done , " abdullah , a sitting member of lok_sabha , said .

tortuous relations_between pakistan and iran two joint_investigation_team ( jit ) reports , one released by the federal_minister_for_maritime_affairs , ali_haider_zaidi , and the other by sindh 's provincial administration , corroborate each_other 's sensational findings about uzair_baloch , who remained a notorious underworld figure in karachi for years . the report issued by zaidi , however , also highlighted baloch 's influence on the pakistan_peoples_party , though this portion was seemingly excised from the document circulated by the sindh_government .   both reports gave us a glimpse_into baloch 's relationship with iran . according to the report uzair claimed to be in possession of an iranian passport and was in contact with the neighboring_country 's intelligence_agencies . the reports reveal that he was tasked to collect_information on pakistan army 's deployment in karachi , military officials and key military_installations in the city .   it is not important which jit_report is true since both of them contain startling_revelations_about iran . zaidi said that the report was released after it was shown to prime_minister_imran_khan , implying that its circulation received a tacit_approval from the highest political office in the country and its release was meant to signal the government 's intent and policy both to the general_public as_well_as iran . this explosive approach to delicate diplomatic matters is counterproductive and should have_been_avoided , especially given our recent_history of difficult relations with the middle_eastern state .   to give a background of the current relations_between_the_two_countries , indian_spy_kulbhushan_jadhav used iran as a transit_route to enter pakistan and commissioned wide_ranging terrorist_activities in balochistan . the heavily_fortified and secured border between the two neighboring_states could not have been crossed without the help of iranian border officials . furthermore , during the time of the taliban rule in afghanistan , pakistan gave diplomatic and economic support to the group , resulting in regular demonstrations in tehran against pakistan and the burning of the pakistani_flag . given that iran is fully under the control of the revolutionary regime , such anti - pakistan sentiment could_not_have_been_possible without tehran 's approval and hence this reflects its official policy toward pakistan back then .   this animosity_between pakistan and iran is largely a product of the iranian_revolution since friendly_relations were a norm during the reign of reza shah Pahlavi . iran was the first country to recognize pakistan , and the shah was the first foreign leader who traveled to it . iran supported pakistan during the 1965_war with india , providing medical and economic assistance . it also provided 5,000 tons of oil to pakistan and hinted_at stopping oil_exports to india .   according to the website of the iranian_embassy in islamabad , tehran also bought 90 sabre jet_fighters from west germany and handed_them_over to pakistan to augment the defense capability of the south_asian state after the war with india came_to_an_end , though such cooperation
xi_jinping plans to control pakistani politics , economy through cpec_authority : report over the years , china has made_several_attempts to gain ultimate control over pakistan 's political and economic_affairs .   since 2016 , president_xi_jinping has lobbied for the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) and a cpec_authority that would place the country 's infrastructure and power_generation_projects under his direct control .   although the proposal was rejected by the nawaz_sharif government , it was ultimately accepted by prime_minister_imran_khan .   according to an article by ali_salman Andani in the asia times , khan , a puppet of the military_establishment , was able to manipulate the law to meet xi 's desires to control pakistan 's planning ministry .   " i regard the pakistani ministry of planning , development_and_special_initiatives as one of the most crucial state_institutions , which senior_officials could implicitly examine and resist xi 's draconian cpec program , because they had access to all secret_documents on the deal and were involved . , directly_and_indirectly , in the decision - making process , " said Andani .   " as long as the reins were in the control of civilian institutions headed_by representatives of the people and officials , deep accountability for xi 's master_plan at_least to some level and at some point   if not immediately   was possible . putting_aside civilian institutions completely would allow xi to play on both_sides of the board , " he said .   the article said that by_2050 , xi planned to have ultimate control over the majority of emerging_market_economies .   Andani said , " xi does_not_want the belt_and_road_initiative or any of its components to be_held_responsible or face resistance . he knows that his chinese dream of indoctrination of a majority of the world 's free peoples by_2050 will not come_true if the peoples of the countries affected by the bri come to know his strategy to destroy their future and that of their generations . futures . "   he said the authority of the cpec will be the authorized_representative of the communist_party_of_china ( cpc ) in pakistan , responsible for the design , implementation , expansion , enforcement , control , regulation . , coordination , monitoring , evaluation and implementation of all activities related to the cpec .   the authority of the cpec will also have the constitutional power to initiate an investigation or even impose_sanctions on any public_office_holder , including the prime_minister and president of pakistan , or those directly_or_indirectly involved in cpec - related_activities that willfully resist specified instructions , instructions or orders . " Andani said while adding , " even the prime_minister 's powers will be limited to what is specified in the cpec_authority bill 2020 . he will therefore have to obey xi 's orders .

" i only sold three heads of cattle in the past_four_days , " al - Quraan , who lives in the central gaza_strip , told_xinhua .   the father of 10 lamented the heavy_losses he has been seeing due to the economic_recession , noting that he used to sell more_than 20 heads of livestock during eid_al - adha season .   eid_al - adha , or the feast_of_sacrifice , falls at the end_of_this_month when muslims will slaughter sheep , goats , camels or calves .   the spread of the coronavirus in gaza has overshadowed the preparations for the feast as it has severely_damaged the already sluggish economy of the israeli - blockaded territory .   livestock merchants complain_about the stagnating sales in the gaza markets due to the reluctance of customers to purchase sacrificial_animals under severe economic_conditions .   al - Quraan explained that he had to sell his livestock on installments . however , he said there are still few buyers .   " people suffer financially even before the coronavirus_outbreak , " al - Quraan said , adding that merchants had to reduce the prices to attract customers .   palestinians gather at a livestock_market ahead_of_eid al - adha festival , in deir al - Balah refugee_camp in central gaza_strip , on july_21 , 2020 .   dozens of local livestock sellers gathered at dir al - Balah livestock_market in the central gaza_strip , waiting for long hours under the burning sun to sell a few heads of sheep .   " i can not believe that i have only sold 15 out of 250 calves in my farm , " said 50 - year - old Mazen Shuheiber , owner of a farm in the southern_gaza_strip .

cpec , gwadar and chabahar : changing regional geopolitics president_hassan_rouhani has expressed more_than once that upon their operationalization , gwadar_deep_sea_port of pakistan and chabahar_port of iran can supplement each_other as sister ports . in 2002 , pakistan started construction of gwadar_port with the help of china purely for the economic purposes . upon its completion in 2006 , its operational responsibilities were given to port of singapore authorities ( psa ) in february 2007 .   unfortunately , psa could not put it into operation and later in 2013 these responsibilities were given to china . as per contract , the port which will remain as pakistani property however , it will_be_operated by the state - run chinese_firm ; china_overseas_port_holding_company ( cophc ) .   owing to its proximity with iran , oman and other gcc states , it was also envisioned that gwadar_port and its huge storage_facilities can_be_utilized for the neighbouring_states and heavy_weight petroleum shipper companies . in a way , this port was envisioned to attain and sustain the larger trade and economic goals which would benefit the countries of west_asia and south_asia alike . besides , the port and its planned communication infrastructure would establish a linkage_between energy_efficient and energy deficient countries of the asian continent .   though operationalization of gwadar_port took a lot of time , however , this deep_sea_port is all set to undertake the major_economies responsibilities for the larger good of pakistan , china and all regional states .   since india was involved in the construction and funding of chabahar_port , therefore , there were apprehensions that , this iranian_port could be later used to counter the gwadar_deep_sea_port ; indeed , to the disadvantage of south and west_asian region . in fact , much before the construction of chabahar_port , india proclaimed itself as the regional_hegemon and a dominant naval power .   it started using the site of the chabahar_port and its surrounding zones for promoting terrorist_activities against pakistan , gwadar_port and the cpec . this was revealed from the indian terrorist spying chief , commander_kulbhushan_jadhav , once he was arrested in april 2017 while entering balochistan_province of pakistan for meeting the terrorists . as the senior most officer of indian spying network ( raw ) , he confessed his role against the gwadar_port , cpec and promotion of terrorism , sectarianism , sub - nationalism and separatism in various_parts of pakistan .   despite having a free_hand in the construction and operationalization of gwadar_port , india has been exploiting iran for over a decade now . rather serving the iranian purpose , india has been using the port and its facilities for its_own strategic_objectives and gaining indian foothold in afghanistan and central_asian_states . besides , new_delhi has been using this facility and iranian energy_resources as a blackmailing strategy . after a lot of deliberations

china focus : china flies AG600 large amphibious aircraft from sea china focus : china flies AG600 large amphibious aircraft from sea   qingdao : china 's indigenously - developed AG600 large amphibious aircraft succeeded in its_maiden_flight over sea on sunday_morning in qingdao , east china 's shandong_province , its developer announced .   the aircraft_took_off from the sea off qingdao at 10:18 a.m. and completed the test flight after flying for about 31 minutes , said state - owned plane - maker aviation_industry_corporation_of_china ( avic ) .   the successful maiden_flight from the sea is a major step_forward in the development of this large amphibious aircraft following its_maiden_flight in 2017 and first takeoff from a water_reservoir in 2018 , said the avic .   the successful maiden_flight paved_the_way_for the aircraft to undergo the following phases of test flights over sea and verification of its performance as an amphibious aircraft .   the AG600 , together with the y-20 large transporter and C919 single - aisle passenger airplane , is part of china 's key project of independently - developed " large aircraft family . "   codenamed Kunlong , the AG600 is a key aeronautical equipment in china 's emergency rescue system , said the avic .   an AG600 " Kunlong " amphibious aircraft slides on the sea off qingdao , east china 's shandong_province , july_26 , 2020 . ( xinhua / li Ziheng )   the AG600 is designed to meet the country 's demands for forest firefighting , marine rescue and other critical emergency rescue missions .   it is also the first time that china 's aviation_industry has developed a special - mission large civil aircraft model .   to prepare for the maiden sea takeoff , the avic completed multiple test flights over sea so that crew_members could become familiar_with the air and marine_environment , according to the developer .   the development team and test flight team have optimized the aircraft , trained test flight pilots and made preparations for test flights in a maritime environment .   starting in 2009 , the AG600 amphibious airplane project has been designed with the potential to have multiple variants , seeking to continuously meet various demands of customers , said the avic .   the multi - tasking amphibious plane can take off and land on both ground and water , thus packing more potential for various missions .   with long - range and long - haul capabilities , the AG600 can efficiently shuttle between the fire site and water source , each time carrying as much as 12 tonnes and dropping water over an area of 4,000 square_meters .   the AG600 is designed to operate in complex weather and environment conditions . in rescue missions ,
china encroaching nepal land ; could set_up ' border_posts ' in seized territories china 's expansionist_agenda is not only visible on the india - china line_of_actual_control ( lac ) but also at the nepal - china border . in a   by nepal 's agriculture_department , massive road development_projects in the tibet_autonomous_region have led to rivers changing their course and expanding china 's boundary into northern territories of nepal .   chinese j-20 stealth jets decades ahead of any indian aircraft including rafale_jets   it warned that there is " a high possibility that over the period of time , china may develop its border observation_post of armed police in those territories " .   earlier by eurasian_times , soldiers from china 's people 's_liberation_army ( pla ) and indian_army were engaged in a fearsome clash_in_galwan_valley which led to the death_of_20_indian_soldiers and unconfirmed casualties_on_the_chinese_side .   china had previously admitted they had casualties but did_not_reveal the numbers . during the military_talks between the officers of the indian_army and the pla , it was confirmed by the chinese_side that one of their commanding_officer had died .   the loss of nepalese_territory due to the rivers changing course could run into " hundreds of hectare land " , it said . " if the receding of land by the river continues , then hundreds of hectare naturally go towards tibet_autonomous_region . there_is_a_high_possibility that over_a_period_of_time , china may develop border observation_posts of its armed police in those territories , " stated the document .   nepal and china share about 1,414 kilometres_long along the himalayas . the survey department of nepal has estimated that the changing course of 11 rivers had already cost nepal 36 hectare , or 0.36 sq_km , across four of its districts ; Humla , Rasuwa , Sindhupalchowk and Sankhuwasabha .   this encroachment by china was first reported last_year which led to several protests in nepal . kp_sharma_oli , the prime_minister of nepal is accused of downplaying the encroachment to avoid deterring its ties_with_china .   indian_army_chief general , m.m. naravane , indicated that nepal 's objection to india 's newly - inaugurated road via the lipulekh_pass in uttarakhand is likely at the behest of china . analysts_believe that oli channelled the public_outrage against china towards india by altering the map and including kalapani , limpiyadhura and lipulekh as_part_of_its_territory .   as reported by various media_houses , a diplomat in new_delhi said pm_oli did_not_inform parliament before it voted on the map earlier_this_month that he had ignored an offer of dialogue between the foreign_secretaries of the two countries . instead , he gave parliamentarians the impression that his government was forced to push the envelope since new_delhi had declined his offer for dialogue .   chinese billionaire and co - founder of alibaba_group , jack_ma , was handed
can counter - coercion work against a belligerent china ? thinking or debating_whether india needs to shed its blinkers of age - old diffidence and issue a direct time - bound ultimatum to the pla to vacate positions that have upset the status_quo can no_longer be tantamount to blasphemy .   while there is a lot of chatter about various strategies that india could adopt in the wake of the recent pla aggression and continued military_build_up in eastern and northern ladakh , there appears_to_be a sense of acceptance creeping in that not much is going to change as the summer passes by and the snows come in . the expanding asymmetry in comprehensive_national_power between_india_and_china means that any indirect strategies that are being furthered by india would largely act as insignificant pinpricks on the dragon 's scales . among these are economic leverages , diplomatic posturing , demonstration of military_capability and political_rhetoric . that the indian military will give a bloody_nose to the pla in any_kind of frontal engagement should the latter attempt_to_push further , albeit with heavy attrition to its_own forces , is a ' no_brainer of an argument .

what countries will be the most_powerful in 2030 ? these just might have the top five .   who is on top and who is down and out keeps shifting throughout history . here 's our guess about where the great_powers will stand in ten_years .   the focus of ground combat operations   has shifted dramatically since the end of the cold_war . relatively few operations now involve the defeat of a technologically and doctrinally similar force , leading to the conquest or liberation of territory . preparation for these operations remains important , but ground combat branches also have a host of other priorities , some ( including counter - insurgency and policing)harkeningback to the origins of the modern military organization .   this first appeared in 2017 and is being reposted due_to_reader_interest .   what will the balance of ground combat power look like in 2030 , presumably after the wars on terror and the wars of russian Reconsolidation ( more to come on this idea below ) shake out ?   predictions are hard , especially about the future , but a few relatively simple questions can help illuminate our analysis . in particular , three questions motivate this study :   does the army have access to national resources , including an innovative technological base ?   does the army have sufficient support from political authorities , without_compromising the organization 's independence ?   does the army have access to experiential learning ; does it have the opportunity_to_learn and innovate in real - world conditions ?   given these questions , most ground combat forces of 2030 will very much resemble the most lethal forces of today , with perhaps a couple of important changes .   the indian_army is poised to stand alongside the world 's most elite ground combat forces . the army has dealt_with combat operations across the intensity spectrum , contending against a maoist insurgency at home , a pakistani - supported insurgency in kashmir , and a variety of other , smaller domestic operations . at_the_same_time , the indian_army remains well - prepared for high_intensity combat against pakistan , having long accepted the need for realistic combat training . altogether , these experiences have helped hone the force into an_effective_tool for new_delhi 's foreign and domestic policy .   the fatal flaw that could take down an f-22 or f-35   smith & Wesson 's .44 magnum revolver : why you should fear the ' dirty harry ' gun   5 best shotguns in the world ( Winchester , Remington and Beretta make the cut )   while indian_army equipment has lagged_behind competitors in important ways ,   india now has access to nearly the entire universe of military technology   and the

foreign_ministry approves_$ 25,000 for renovation of just one bathroom islamabad : foreign_ministry has sanctioned $_25,000 for the repair and renovation of just one bathroom of the official_residence in new_york of the country 's permanent_representative to the united_nations .   informed_sources said that in the name of renovation of the official_residence of pakistan 's permanent_representative to the un , already $_50,000 have been spent from mission 's account , $ 225,000 are committed whereas additional $_25,000 has now been sanctioned for the renovation of the master bathroom .   operative part of an official letter_dated june 24 , 2020 , issued by foreign_ministry and addressed to Parepun new_york ( permanent_representative un ) , reads as : " 2 . the foreign_secretary has given approval for the expenditure amounting_to_$ 25,000/- for the repair and renovation of the master bathroom of the permanent_representative , subject to fulfillment of all_codal_formalities . 3 . Parepun new_york is required to please convey relevant bank_account details to Parep new_york ( cg ) for transfer_of_funds . 4 . Parep new_york ( cg ) is required to kindly transfer an_amount_of_$ 25,000/- from its FIGOB account to Parepun new_york . "   according to a source this latest sanction of $ 25000 is just one extra spending on a bathroom , which is already in good condition . the source said that munir_akram , pakistan 's permanent_representative to the un , is already living in the us and had an old house outside new_york .   the source said that $ 225,000 coming in the name of renovation of official_residence other than this $ 25000 . around_$_50,000 has already been spent from mission 's account , the source said .   the source said that this is a wasteful expenditure particularly in view of the country 's worrisome economic situation . " this issue needs inquiry , " the source said , adding that the spending also violates prime_minister_imran_khan 's policy of austerity and simplicity .   prime_minister_imran_khan has repeatedly spoken of promoting austerity and adopting simplicity . he has also been directing his cabinet_members that austerity_measures be implemented_in_letter_and_spirit .   the premier has also been explaining to the cabinet of all those initiatives that he personally took for austerity keeping_in_view the current economic_challenges faced by the country . the government has also been claiming to have saved billions by cutting wasteful expenditure .   after the formation of pti 's government , several steps were taken by the federal_government including turning the prime_minister house into a university and auctioning the cars and buffaloes of the pm house .   prime_minister house 's luxurious rooms , halls and bathrooms were shown on tv_shows to propagate how the public money was wasted in the past . but now on just one bathroom 's renovation $_25,000 ( rs4.2 million ) has been sanctioned
china 's espionage on us soil wo_n't end with consulate closure china 's houston consulate might have   , but do_n't_expect that decision to have a major impact on beijing 's espionage campaign on u.s. soil .   china views its u.s. diplomatic presence as a subset of its intelligence presence . this activity is pursued by ministry_of_state_security intelligence officers and people 's_liberation_army attaches operating out of beijing 's embassy and its four remaining consulates in new_york , chicago , san_francisco , and los_angeles . in turn , the trump_administration will be well_aware that china 's espionage effort wo_n't be significantly restrained by the closure of its houston station .   this closure , then , is ultimately designed to establish a new consequence foundation to guide china 's perception of what it can_get_away_with when_it_comes_to spying on u.s. soil . china 's intelligence challenge for america , here , is threefold .   the first issue is that beijing_sees its targeting of u.s. intellectual_property , government officials , and chinese american_citizens as critical national priorities . determined to replace the u.s.-led international order with a beijing - based   , chinese_president_xi_jinping needs to steal as much high - value technology as he can in order to buffer china 's own domestic economy and ensure that any challenge to his rule is quickly stamped out .   this latter factor underlines the particular aggression of chinese intelligence officers toward chinese american_citizens on u.s. soil . due to their general opposition to the chinese_communist_party 's tyranny and their often overt preference for political reform , xi 's paranoid security services view those individuals   to the communist_party regime .   another challenge is that the u.s. lacks the counterintelligence capability to monitor china 's espionage effort adequately . the ministry_of_state_security has   its tradecraft in recent_years , cutting back on its use of platforms such as cellphones , which the u.s. has the advantage in detecting . that means human surveillance_teams need to follow chinese spies physically . this poses a resource problem , in that at_least seven people are needed at any one time in order to monitor covertly a trained intelligence officer .   considering that a significant_portion of china 's accredited diplomats are spies , it is simply not possible to keep_an_eye_on all of them at all times . that is to say nothing of the various   , both official and occasional , whom china employs . it must be said , however , that china 's intelligence presence on u.s. soil also provides   for the recruitment of american agents . this recruitment is exceptionally difficult on chinese soil due to the extensive soviet - style monitoring of cia officers .   finally , there 's the fact that much of china 's spying
dream of ram_mandir_at_ayodhya is finally coming true . here is how congress tried to derail it for years remember when after denying lord_ram 's existence they said that only congress pm will build ram_mandir and bjp will never as they 'll ' run out of election_promises '   pm_modi to visit ayodhya for bhoomi_poojan for ram_mandir ( image_courtesy @narendramodi on twitter )   in september 2007 , the central government run by congress - led UPA1 had said that there_is_no historical proof of lord_ram 's existence .   no historical proof of ram   in 2007 , an_affidavit filed by the congress - led government read " valmiki ramayana and Ramcharitmanas admittedly form an_important_part of ancient indian literature , but these can_not_be said to be historical_records to incontrovertibly prove the existence of the characters and occurrences of events depicted therein . " the affidavit was filed to register the upa_government 's opposition to the demand to scrap the Setusamudram project as it would damage the ram setu .   did_you_know rahul_gandhi 's close_aide and senior_congress_leader kapil_sibal fought the ram_janmabhoomi case for the sunni_waqf_board   the building of a magnificent ram_temple at the disputed site_in_ayodhya . and that he also employed   and asked the apex_court to delay the decision in the ram_janmabhoomi case till 2019 elections .   while sibal may claim he is fighting against the construction of grand_ram_temple at ayodhya in his ' personal_capacity ' only those with iq lower_than that of rahul_gandhi would actually believe that . another eminent congress_leader shashi_tharoor had earlier   that no ' good hindu ' would want a ram_mandir at babri site . tharoor   that one should have the ram_mandir in one 's heart . tharoor , ironically , wrote_a_book titled ' why i_am a hindu ' . perhaps the book was rhetorical rather_than introspective .   in november_2018 , months_ahead of 2019 general_elections , congress_leader cp joshi had   that only a congress prime_minister will build a ram_mandir_at_ayodhya .   cp joshi on ram_mandir in november_2018   just ahead of 2019 elections , after years of denying the very existence of lord_ram , congress went into an overdrive in a bid to consolidate hindu votes . congress had suddenly promised ram_mandir_at_ayodhya , that too under a congress government headed_by a congress pm . rahul_gandhi 's posters where he was made to look like lord_ram had appeared .   rahul_gandhi as lord_ram   the party went from denying existence of lord_ram to portraying their pm candidate as lord_ram ( which by their_own logic would not exist ) .   rahul_gandhi when he realises congress ' logic   it was not only congress but its entire ecosystem that rooted against the construction_of_ram_mandir . remember how there were numerous op - eds where the self

why traditional custodians must involve all of hindu society in making temples great Rangesh sridhar and amar Govindarajan   if temple resources were indeed made available , millions of scholarships and new institutions can be opened up to hindu students of all castes .   we need our temples and their resources to take on a quasi - political role and help bring in a hindu renaissance .   there has been significant momentum on the issue of freeing hindu_temples from state control . there_have_been_instances of temple land sales being opposed , fund transfers from temples objected to and court challenges to new laws that allow more temples to be taken over by state government run bodies .   all of these are good developments in the sense that it sends out a strong_signal that temple administration can_not_be taken_for_granted anymore , and that there are alert activists looking for evidence to punish wanton wastage of temple resources .   however , there is yet to be a meaningful_dialogue on what_happens once the temples are free . it may be argued that what_will_happen to temples can be debated once the temples are free and that the current challenge is to first stop state control .   but that is not true . without viable structures that can take over temple management and run them in a transparent and efficient_manner , and convince the hindu populace of its inclusiveness , there will always be a degree of support for government involvement in temples .   to be_able_to remove the state the temple activists must show an efficient alternative that will benefit not just the limited circle of a small community of traditional custodians but the wider hindu_community in the district that the temple is situated in   at_stake here is not just the rights of traditional custodians of temples but also the future of millions of hindus . if temple resources were indeed made available , millions of scholarships and new institutions can be opened up to hindu students of all castes thereby deterring conversions through christian educational_institutions .   through preferential_treatment to hindus , temples can provide social security nets ( jobs ) to millions of hindus thereby making them stakeholders in a more prosperous temple ecosystem .   hindu_temples could be running massive hospitals - once_again drawing millions of devotees and simultaneously acting for their benefit .   but in order for the temples to be_able_to do all this they must be empowered and organised in a manner that involves all sections of hindu society . here are some ways to ensure temples are more_than traditional places_of_worship under control of one community .   first , the stated mandate of the organisation must be the propagation of hindu faith - of their_own respective sect , the economic well

once science_fiction , gene editing is now a looming reality this article is part of a series exploring how the americans with_disabilities act has shaped modern life for people_with_disabilities .   ask any expectant couple what they hope their baby will be , and one answer is likely to be " healthy . "   but one gene gone awry can imperil a child 's health , causing serious disease or a disability that leaves one more_susceptible to health issues . with advances in gene - editing technology , though , biomedicine is entering an uncharted era in which a genetic_mutation can be reversed , not only for one person but also for subsequent generations .   public debate has swirled around genetic_engineering since the first experiments in gene splicing in the 1970s . but the debate has taken on new urgency in recent_years as gene modification has been simplified with   ( short for clustered regularly Interspaced short Palindromic repeats ) technology .   scientists have compared the technology to word processing software : it acts like a cursor placed next to a typo , capable of editing a gene at a level so granular it can change a single letter in a long genetic_sequence .   while still highly theoretical when_it_comes_to eliminating disabilities , gene editing has drawn_the_attention of the disability community . the prospect of erasing some disabilities and perceived deficiencies hovers at the margins of what people consider ethically acceptable .   " people are understandably very scared of it , of the many different roads it could take us down as a society , " said meghan Halley , a bioethics researcher at stanford_university and mother of three children , including a 5 - year - old with a disability . " broadly_speaking , this is always going to be problematic because of the many things that disability means . "   crispr is widely_seen_as holding great promise for treating diseases that until now have been intractable .   there are two main types of crispr - based editing . one is the correction of a gene in an individual living with a condition or disease . this is known as somatic cell editing ( " somatic " refers to the body ) .   , npr reported that victoria gray , a woman with sickle cell disease , experienced a significant_decrease in her episodes of painful sickle crises in the first year after gene - editing treatment .   in the future , ms. gray 's children or grandchildren may be_able_to take_advantage of the other type of crispr " fix " : an edit to the human germ line . this involves making changes to a fertilized egg that not only last   through the life of an individual but also are

( ians / mea )   in the last_few_weeks , india 's eastern neighbor is being wooed by not just china but pakistan also , even as india is mending its relations after last_year 's downswing owing to the controversy over the national_register for citizens . while pakistan is trying to improve its rock - bottom relations_with_bangladesh and china is giving concessions through its belt_&_road_initiative , india is now bettering its ties with a friendly country .   earlier_this_week , pakistan prime_minister_imran_khan telephoned his_bangladeshi_counterpart_sheikh_hasina on wednesday_afternoon in a rare effort to patch_up long - fraught_relations . though the bangladesh government called it a " courtesy call , " it is seen as a proactive effort by islamabad to warm up to a country which has remained suspicious of pakistan right since bangladesh 's birth in 1971 .   pakistan is believed to have played_a_role in the assassination of sheikh_mujibur_rahman , the first leader of the newly - formed bangladesh , and the father of current bangladeshi prime_minister hasina .   the genocide perpetuated by the pakistani army under the orders of general_yahya_khan through operation Searchlight , which targeted bengali students , university_teachers , women , activists and minorities including hindus . the leaders and supporters of the awami_league party bore_the_brunt of the pakistani armed_forces genocide on the bengalis .   even_though pakistan and bangladesh bilateral_relations improved over decades , pakistan tried to use its high_commission_in_dhaka for anti - india activitiesinfiltrating fake_indian_currency and supporting terror_activities from bangladeshi soil . for these reasons , the hasina government kept an arm 's distance from pakistan after she became prime_minister in 2009 . though dhaka acquiesced to speak with islamabad , dhaka preferred to keep the talks low - key while a jubilant islamabad went ahead with a longish press_release .   china has been upping its economic and military game all around india including in bangladesh . it has undertaken several core projects_under_the_bri in india 's eastern neighbor , which_includes building ports , strengthening its defence infrastructure and the navy . china has been supplying submarines and ships to bangladesh and is upgrading its naval facilities . however , it goes to the credit of bangladesh that it has not been swayed_by chinese_investments and   having witnessed the growing chinese imprint in the neighborhood and also its unreliability as a bilateral partner , india is now looking back at narendra_modi 's ' neighborhood first ' policy which he had kick - started in 2014 at the time of taking over as the prime_minister . however , as the policy unraveled five_years later in 2019 , india is

" our relations_with_bangladesh are time - tested and historic . we appreciate their consistent_stand that jammu_and_kashmir and all its developments are india 's internal_matters . it 's a stand they have always taken , " said ministry_of_external_affairs ( mea ) spokesperson_anurag_srivastava , as reported by ndtv .   the recent conversation_between khan and hasina comes_at_a_time_when tensions_between_india_and_china escalated over the last_few_months over disputed_borders . however , political pundits say while islamabad may seem to be trying hard to smooth its relationship with dhaka , it had recently adopted resolutions against the war_crimes trial of bangladesh wherein some major criminals were hanged for committing_crimes_against humanity in 1971 .   delhi braces for major showdown on nov 26 as thousands of farmers plan to march down to national capital   pm_modi reviews

( reuters ) - the u.s. demand this week that china close its consulate_in_houston is the latest_in_a_string of disputes that have taken the relationship_between the world 's two biggest_economies to its lowest_point in decades .   file_photo : the flags of china , u.s. and the chinese_communist_party are displayed in a flag stall at the yiwu wholesale_market in yiwu , zhejiang_province , china , may 10 , 2019 . reuters / aly_song / file_photo   here are the main points of contention_between beijing and washington :   u.s. president_donald_trump has accused china of a lack_of_transparency about the coronavirus , which first emerged in the chinese_city_of_wuhan late_last_year . he regularly refers to it as the " china virus . "   trump said chinese officials " ignored their reporting obligations " to the world_health_organization about the virus - that has killed hundreds_of_thousands of people globally - and pressured the u.n. agency to " mislead_the_world . "   china says it has been transparent about the outbreak and the who has denied trump 's assertions that it promoted chinese " disinformation " about the virus . the united_states plans to quit the who in mid-2021 over its handling of the pandemic .   the trump_administration began increasing tariffs on imports_from_china , its largest_trading_partner , in 2018 as part of an_ambitious_plan to force beijing to curb subsidies on state manufacturing and tough demands on u.s. companies in china .   after more_than a year of tit - for - tat tariffs that slowed global economic_growth , the countries signed a trade_deal in january_2020 that rolls_back some tariffs , but does_not address_the_core_issues . beijing has pledged to increase imports of u.s. goods by $_200_billion over two years .   the u.s. commerce and state departments are pushing u.s. companies to move sourcing and manufacturing out of china .   the united_states has hardened its position in recent_weeks on the south_china_sea , where it has accused china of attempting_to_build a " maritime empire " in the potentially energy - rich waters .   brunei , malaysia , the philippines , taiwan and vietnam challenge china 's claim to about 90 % of the sea . a july_13 statement by u.s. secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo was the first time the united_states had called china 's claims unlawful and accused beijing of a " campaign of bullying " .   china and the united_states have clashed over pro - democracy_protests_in_hong_kong , most recently beijing 's imposition of new security_legislation on the former_british_colony , which returned to chinese_rule_in_1997 .   trump this month signed_an_executive_order to end preferential economic treatment for hong_kong , allowing him to impose_sanctions and visa_restrictions_on_chinese officials

cracking the case of south india 's missing vegetables la Frontera , santa_cruz de Tenerife , spain   Monumento Meridiano Cerro ( Meridiano zero monument )   what i learned about a pioneering black cookbook author by cooking her recipes   a food designer used quarantine to track down the mystery produce in his grandmother 's cookbook .   Muralidharan worked with illustrators Shrishti Dabolkar and Priyadarshini Narayana to create renderings of the vegetables featured in   akash Muralidharan 's quest to find   forgotten south indian vegetables began when he cleaned out his bedroom . it was january_2020 , and he had just returned to his home city of chennai after_finishing his master 's degree in food design and innovation in milan . like many students returning_home after graduation , Muralidharan found that his childhood bedroom had become a storeroom . Muralidharan was clearing space for himself when he spotted it : his grandmother kamala Natarajan 's copy of   , is a classic text of 20th - century vegetarian tamil brahmin cooking . authored_by meenakshi Ammal , a widow turned chef - auteur , the book consists of 350 recipes for beloved dishes including   sambar , rasam , payasam , and uppuma   at_a_time_when both vernacular indian cookbooks and widows ' participation in public life were rare in tamil_nadu ,   was trailblazing . it became a staple of young_women 's bridal trousseaus and a culinary lifeline for the tamil brahmin families who migrated to the united_states and europe in a time when letters lagged and bad lines often cut phone_calls short . today ,   remains a beloved reference for home_cooks looking to recreate their grandmother 's recipes , as_well_as outsiders learning the basics of one of south india 's many region- and community - specific cuisines .   , or air potatoes , are rough - skinned , root - fuzzed yam - cousin with origins in tropical asia .   , or grandmother , had also received   as a wedding present . as Muralidharan flipped through her spotless copy , the recipes were redolent with memories . " she was one person who introduced me to food , " he says .   Muralidharan had grown up in a joint family that included his paati kamala , cousins , and aunts and uncles . kamala would rest in the afternoon , reading   until she leapt up , entered the kitchen , and recreated its contents by memory .

pakistan 's information war campaign against india needs attention what is noteworthy is that the same anti - india narrative is repeated ad nauseam from every medium and platform   whether it is politicians like imran_khan or shah_mehmood_qureshi , the ispr , or print , electronic_and_social_media .   there has been a sharp_increase in pakistan 's vicious information war campaign against india .   there has been a sharp_increase in pakistan 's vicious information war campaign against india . an analysis would reveal three triggers : the   attack of february_2019 , the return of the   government in the may 2019 elections and the august_2019 revision of   balakot demolished pakistan 's longstanding assumption that the nuclear equivalence guaranteed that india would not retaliate_against terrorist_attacks . the return of the bjp government signalled that india would continue to follow a muscular policy for the next_five_years . the article_370 decision demolished the centrepiece of pakistan 's nationalism   " kashmir_banega pakistan "   and raised apprehensions about india 's plans for pakistan occupied_jammu_and_kashmir ( pojk ) .   these developments have forced it to shift the emphasis of its anti - india strategy from fomenting_terrorism supported by an information war component to an information war supported by terrorism .   pakistan has two main instruments working_in_tandem for the furtherance of this policy   the isi and the inter - services public_relations ( ispr ) . the ispr is a one - stop - shop for the info war against india . it has , over the years , recruited thousands of youth , trained them in the mechanics of social_media and used them to project anti - india themes .   the core pakistani objective is to demolish " brand india " by attacking its key_components   an inclusive and secular society , democratic_polity , decisive government , a developing economic_powerhouse and strong foreign_policy . this has been done by trying to polarise society and disrupt social_cohesion . the expectation is that such a strategy would have a cascading_effect , adversely impacting india 's secular_and_democratic_credentials , scare foreign_investment and lead to questions_about its international image .   the key platforms for this strategy are twitter , whatsapp , youtube and   . a large_number of fake social_media_accounts , especially on twitter , have been created . even_though twitter is not the most_popular platform in terms of numbers in either india or pakistan , it is perhaps the most effective form of instant communication . pakistan has developed malicious narratives embellished with fake audio_and_video clips . the use of handles with phoney middle_eastern identities is the latest addition to its bag of tricks .   internal developments and dissent in india have been manipulated , packaged and used to develop a narrative damaging india 's

" we correct the news and save_lives , " said Baher Jassem , an iraqi activist from the tech 4 peace collective , which switched from its four - year campaign against fake political and economic news to setting the record_straight on covid-19 .   every few hours , the collective 's facebook , instagram and twitter pages publish screenshots of fabricated_news stories about the virus , from claims about new remedies to celebrity deaths from the illness or a reassuring wave of recoveries .   the pictures are marked with a red stamp reading " fake post " , accompanied_by a correction and links to more accurate_information . their accounts reach more_than_one_million followers .   " we do_n't just want to expose lies . we want to spread_awareness_about the coronavirus , the right way to protect_yourself , the wrong remedies that are circulating , " Jassem told_afp .   the corrections campaign could not have come sooner : the region appears_to_be experiencing a long - feared covid-19 spike .   iraq 's daily case rate increase exploded to more_than_2,000 in late june , nearing 3,000 per day this month .   lebanon , oman and algeria saw peaks of daily new cases in mid - july , while saudi_arabia and jordan witnessed crests in late june but appear to be stabilizing .   doctors in iraq blame online misinformation : their patients have insisted coronavirus is an american conspiracy , or people are actually dying from a sarin gas attack , or that iraq 's blistering heat would halt the virus 's spread .   medics say such false_information could make people less_likely to wear_masks in public , abide_by social_distancing or wash_their_hands regularly .   misinformation about covid-19 has been spreading in various languages since the pandemic 's early_days , but the proliferation in arabic is particularly dangerous because of the lack of quality reporting , activists told_afp .   indeed , reporters_without_borders has noted authorities ' tightening control over media in the middle_east in 2020 , specifically over information relating to covid-19 .   as_a_result , activists said , news consumers are suspicious of the information they find in traditional outlets and more likely to entertain conspiracy_theories .

chinese debt_trap_diplomacy : noose_around the neck of naya_pakistan ? chinese debt_trap_diplomacy as part of chinese economic imperialism   chinese debt_trap_diplomacy is used by imperialist china to control the world . many countries_around_the_world that voluntarily or involuntarily fell into the chinese debt_trap , are following the orders of communist ccp china . recent 2 ordinances signed by president of pakistan has tightened the chinese noose_around naya_pakistan 's already_fragile neck .   the world 's focus on soviet_russia and ignorance of china was fully used by china to an extent that but it 's not a fair enough game . chinese economic policy was simple   create a manufacture based ecosystem guaranteeing the lowest manufacturing cost in the world , part of it arising from slave_labour camps and part of it due to the export_subsidies china provides to it 's exporters .   for the manufacture industry china built , china needs a market to sell   countries which are economically backward , governments which are corrupt and countries which perceive themselves to be vulnerable and wanted allies . there are some cases , though , where the governments wanted to genuinely help their citizens but were caught in the chinese debt_trap .   xi_jinping 's imperialistic ambition and hunger for power has sidelined the democratic_institutions , elected_representatives , constitutional_bodies in every country china has stepped in . as mentioned_above , chinese_communist ccp has done this to expand its direct influence over the political and economic processes in the countries .   we covered about the chinese debt_trap_diplomacy to take over the entire_world .   in another another previous article   we covered , how china has used debt_trap_diplomacy to gain control in african_continent .   we covered in details the case of ghana , and how china is exploiting the natural_resources and destroying the environment especially the land and the water_resources that are the lifeline of millions of people of ghana .   noose_around the neck of naya_pakistan ?   pakistan is a classic_example of a failed country . the corrupt polity and army needed to run it 's anti - indian agenda even if it is at the expense of pakistan and in the recent_years , china has become the milch cow for pakistani army to spread it 's nefarious_agenda . with matching interests over india , it is but natural that china will embrace pakistan with_open_arms , but on it 's own terms . as like with every other country , china is slowly poisoning pakistan by creating extreme shortages of foreign - exchange reserves . in the end , these countries will have to accept the invasion of their political and economic systems by the communist_party_of_china . two statements actually spell out the trouble which pakistan is in   an adage which goes in indian

pompeo says us to expand arctic role to deter russia , china copenhagen , denmark ( ap )   u.s. secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo said wednesday the united_states will become more active in the arctic to counter growing russian influence and thwart attempts by china to insert itself into the region .   during a brief visit to denmark , pompeo hailed the reopening of the u.s. consulate in the semi - autonomous danish territory of greenland and announced a new sustainable fisheries and commercial engagement agreement with the Faroe islands , another danish territory in the north_atlantic .   " it 's a new day for the united_states in greenland , " pompeo told_reporters at a_joint_news_conference with danish foreign_minister Jeppe Kofod .   the u.s. consulate in Nuuk , greenland 's capital , reopened in june after a decades - long_hiatus . the move attracted_attention because of u.s. president_donald_trump 's stated interest last_year in purchasing greenland from denmark .   Kofod said the idea of the u.s. buying greenland , which was roundly rejected and ridiculed by both Greenlandic and danish officials , was not raised during his talks with pompeo on wednesday .

Jenis av rana , the Faroe islands ' minister for culture and foreign_affairs , told danish media ahead of Kofod 's meeting with pompeo that he was keen to discuss what role washington sees the north_atlantic archipelago playing in the arctic .   he also wondered about the possibility of a free_trade_agreement between the united_states and the Faroe islands , an autonomous danish territory with some 52,000 inhabitants that is located north of scotland between iceland and norway .   av rana told danish broadcaster TV2 he was concerned the arctic could become a battleground for the u.s. and other major global powers , including russia and china .

" cpec is a transformational_project , a game_changer for pakistan . the environment in the region is improving by the day , pakistan is becoming the centre of all the development , and peace_and_prosperity is becoming visible in our lifetime . we have to take_advantage of this . "   he said cpec was planned in three_phases . the first was meant to fill_the_gaps in our infrastructure in communication and energy .   giving example of the roads , the eastern route from peshawar to karachi , he said : " we 've just completed the multan to sukkur_motorway . now one section of that road is left , which is sukkur to hyderabad . similarly , hard_work on the western_route is going on . the western_route mostly passes_through remote_areas which can uplift the economy of those areas and it will be great in order to mobilise all logistics from china to pakistan . "   mentioning the priority_areas in the second_phase , he said the focus was on mass industrialisation through special_economic_zones .   there are a total of nine zones to be built and they 're working on three prioritised zones   rashakai , faisalabad and dhabeji   adding one more in balochistan .   on agriculture , he said the focus was on three things : enhancing the yield of our agriculture , induction of technology and water_conservation and farm management .   then there is the area of science_and_technology for which they 're working with the ministry_of_science_and_technology .   mr bajwa said : " we are taking cpec into the tourism_sector . it is one area we have a lot [ of ] potential but suffering because of a lack of system and infrastructure .

the iran question makes a comeback the iran question has come once_again to haunt indian foreign_policy , as it does every few_years . there is an emerging chorus of voices pondering how new_delhi is losing iran . we are being told how critical iran is to indian strategic_interests , and we are reminded of that highly misused concept   " civilisational ties " . then we are warned that india is neglecting its ties with iran , all because of that ubiquitous american pressure . we are told how gargantuan a loss it is and how the entire edifice of indian foreign_policy might just crumble because we have failed to nurture our relationship with iran . indeed , no country other than iran has had such an outsized impact on indian foreign_policy discourse over the last_two_decades .   the latest shock in india - iran ties have come from revelations that india may have been ousted from a project involving the construction of a railway_line from chabahar_port to zahedan . this railway_line project was part of the trilateral pact signed during prime_minister_narendra_modi 's visit to tehran in 2016 , with afghanistan and iran committing india to build an alternate trade_route to afghanistan and central_asia . indian railways construction ltd ( ircon ) was to take this project forward with a financing of around us$ 1.6_billion . early this year , the development of farzad - b gas_field , which was_supposed_to_be a joint_venture_between iran and ongc Videsh ( OVL ) , was also awarded to a domestic entity . tehran decided that " in the immediate future , iran would develop the field on its_own and would like to involve india appropriately at_a_later_stage . "   the latest shock in india - iran ties have come from revelations that india may have been ousted from a project involving the construction of a railway_line from chabahar_port to zahedan   these decisions have led to an intense_debate in india about the failure of indian foreign_policy . but foreign_policy is not something that a nation engages in with itself . by its very definition , it is a process that involves more_than one entity . it is iterative , as much a function of what a nation does   others , as it is of what other entities do to that country . so while india may have its agenda and priorities , iran 's own might be completely_different .   and that has been the case for long . for tehran , india is important but not critical in shaping its foreign_policy worldview . it is the us that is the primary actor that shapes tehran 's foreign_policy calculus . while critics in india often argue that new_delhi has ignored tehran under us pressure , it is exactly the other_way_round . it is tehran that has not

crooks have acquired proprietary Diebold software to " jackpot " atms sign_up or login to join the discussions !   sign_up to comment and more   crooks have acquired proprietary Diebold software to " jackpot " atms   atm maker is investigating the use of its software in black_boxes used by thieves .   jul 20 , 2020 9:40 pm utc   Diebold Nixdorf , which made $_3.3_billion from atm sales and service last_year , is warning stores , banks , and other customers of a new hardware - based form of " jackpotting , " the industry term for attacks that thieves use to quickly empty atms .   the new variation uses a device that runs parts of the company 's proprietary software stack . attackers then connect the device to the atm internals and issue commands . successful attacks can result in a stream of cash , sometimes dispensed as fast as 40 bills every 23 seconds . the devices are attached either by gaining_access to a key that unlocks the atm chassis or by drilling holes or otherwise breaking the physical locks to gain_access to the machine internals .   in previous jackpotting attacks , the attached devices , known in the industry as black_boxes , usually invoked programming interfaces contained in the atm operating system to funnel commands that ultimately reached the hardware component that dispenses cash . more recently , Diebold Nixdorf has observed a spate of black_box attacks that incorporated parts of the company 's proprietary software .   " some of the successful attacks show a new adapted modus_operandi on how the attack is performed , " Diebold Nixdorf warned in an   that was issued last_week and provided to Ars by a company representative . " although the fraudster is still connecting an external device , at_this_stage of our investigations it appears that this device also contains parts of the software stack of the attacked atm . "   in general , jackpotting refers to a category of attacks aiming to dispense cash from an atm illegitimately . the black_box variant of jackpotting does_not utilize the software stack of the atm to dispense money from the terminal . instead , the fraudster connects his own device , the " black_box , " to the dispenser and targets the communication to the cash - handling device directly .   in the recent_incidents , attackers are focusing on outdoor systems and are destroying parts of the fascia in order to gain physical access to the head compartment . next , the usb cable between the CMD - V4 dispenser and the special electronics , or the cable between special electronics and the atm pc , was unplugged . this cable is connected to the black_box of the attacker in order to send

india must formally revive quad , seek its expansion the time for ambivalence is over and while india will have to fight its_own territorial battles with determination , this is the moment to seek external balancing . it is also time to seek an enlargement of this grouping into a partnership of the like - minded .   when america first reached out to india in the early_1990s to offer military - to - military cooperation , the indian_navy ( in ) , keen to shed its cold_war insularity , responded eagerly .   the recent re - emergence of terms like " malabar " and " quad " in the media , as_well_as in the national_security discourse should be music to the ears of india 's small but diehard band of " navalists " ( advocates of maritime power ) , who had not long_ago heard disheartening public pronouncements that since the indian_armed_forces were not " expeditionary forces "   for global deployment   they must confine_themselves to " guard and fight " only along national borders .   it is essential for india 's strategic - planners and policy - makers to retain clarity about the reason india has become a partner that is sought after by the us and others . while india 's status as a nuclear - weapon state and major land / air power , as_well_as a growing economy and attractive market , has been known for some time , new_delhi 's newfound allure for the us , the quad and   is rooted only in its ability to project power and influence in distant ocean reaches .   in the current_scenario , given chinese intransigence and our misreading of their imperialist - expansionist intent , sino - indian tensions are likely_to_persist . if india is not to cede ground physically or diplomatically , it must muster all elements of its " comprehensive_national_power " , including the maritime , and create a strong negotiating position . apart_from the balance of forces on land favouring china , there is also the beijing - islamabad axis that awaits activation . keeping tensions confined to the himalayan arena is , therefore , not only militarily advantageous to china but a continental focus also helps to keep india contained in a " south - asia box " .   indian resistance to china 's expansionism would be a definitive moment in asia 's geopolitical evolution   to the navalists , this seems all the more reason for india to try shifting the confrontation to " sea - level " , where the asymmetry is in its favour . in this context , if exercise malabar and the quadrilateral concept are at long last going to be leveraged to make common cause in the maritime_domain , the provenance of both
balochi militants take aim at chinese interests despite the mounting security risk to chinese_nationals , the sunk costs indicate a continued chinese presence in pakistan .   a police commando stands_guard_outside the pakistan_stock_exchange after an attack in karachi , pakistan , monday , june_29 , 2020 .   on june_29 , four members of the majeed_brigade , a faction of the balochistan_liberation_army ( bla ) , launched_an_attack on the pakistan_stock_exchange_building_in_karachi , sindh_province , resulting in 10 fatalities . the majeed_brigade was founded in 2011 and is an_elite_unit within the bla , with a modus_operandi that regularly features suicide_attacks . that an attack was carried_out on the karachi_stock_exchange is significant , given its high_profile and location in the city 's central corporate district , which headquarters several multinational_corporations . early analysis indicates , however , that the militants were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempt to establish a days - long_siege in the building   with   the total operation reportedly lasting less_than_an_hour   the bla is one of several militant_groups pursuing an independent baloch nation , or significantly_greater autonomy . the group views both pakistani and chinese interests in the region as a threat , characterizing them as exploitative . balochistan_province is rich_in_natural_resources , such as minerals , but remains one of the least developed and educated in the country . hostility_toward chinese foreign workers and associated interests has peaked as local_communities feel disconnected from the ongoing chinese - backed infrastructure_development linked to the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) . china 's investments_in_infrastructure in balochistan have little practical benefit for local_populations , while further integrating balochistan with wider pakistan through developing transport and power networks .   the bla is part of the baloch raji aajoi_sangar ( bras ) umbrella_group of baloch_nationalists , which comprises of the bla , the baloch_liberation_front ( blf ) , the baloch_republican guard , as_well_as the baloch republic army . bras and its_affiliates are generally pro - independence for the balochistan region ; they regard both pakistan and china as threats . while the groups typically work separately to achieve their aims , they have been known to band_together to execute attacks . one example includes the joint_operation aas - Rech launched in february_2020 , with   local baloch groups stating that the coalition reportedly_attacked the islamist_militant group lashkar - e - taiba   the outfit benefited_from the patronage of the national government and intelligence_services   , though this is not confirmed .   what explains the bla 's latest target ? in addition to the profile of the karachi_stock_exchange being significant for pakistan , it is also very_closely linked to , and representative of , china 's interests .   in january 2017 , a consortium of chinese_firms acquired 40_percent equity of the pakistan_stock_exchange for $ 85 million   november_2019 ,

india 's struggle to gain_influence in foreign_policy due to 3 past ' burdens ' : eam_jaishankar on new- the new_indian_express india 's struggle to gain_influence in foreign_policy due to 3 past ' burdens ' : eam_jaishankar on new book   external_affairs_minister_s_jaishankar ( photo_|_pti )   new_delhi : india has had to struggle mightily to gain_influence in a domain that could have come more easily earlier as its foreign_policy carries " three major burdens " from its past -- partition , delayed economic_reforms and prolonged exercise of the nuclear_option , says external_affairs_minister_s_jaishankar .   the former diplomat makes these remarks in his new book " the india way : strategies for an uncertain world " , which is scheduled for release on september_7 .   with the period from the 2008_global_financial_crisis to the 2020 coronavirus_pandemic seeing a real transformation of the world order , jaishankar analyses the challenges india faces and spells_out possible policy_responses .   as india rises in the world order , it should not only visualise its interests with great clarity but also communicate them effectively , he writes in the book .   jaishankar says india 's foreign_policy carries three major burdens from its past .   " one is the 1947_partition , which reduced the nation both demographically and politically . an unintended consequence was to give china more strategic space in asia .   " another is the delayed economic_reforms that were undertaken a decade_and_a_half after those of china   the 15 - year gap continues to put india at a great disadvantage . "   the third , jaishankar says , is the prolonged exercise of the nuclear_option .   " as_a_result , india has had to struggle mightily to gain_influence in a domain that could have come so much more easily earlier . "   he terms his book an " effort to contribute to that endeavour , encouraging an honest conversation among indians , without discouraging the world from eavesdropping " .   in a statement , publishers harpercollins india says the very nature of international_relations and its rules is changing and for india , this means optimal relationships with all the major_powers to best advance its goals .   " jaishankar analyses these challenges and spells_out possible policy_responses . in doing so , he is very conscious of balancing india 's national interest with international responsibilities .   " he places this thinking in the context of history and tradition , appropriate for a civilisational power that seeks to reclaim its place on the world stage , " it says .   " so , rather_than allow events to come upon us , these are better anticipated and analysed . "   " i have had a ringside view of recent global changes .

our ' maximum_pressure ' on iran failed our ' maximum_pressure ' on iran failed   unless the goal was to help china   secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo . ( pool / reuters )   the trump_administration 's " maximum_pressure " campaign against iran has manifestly failed_to_achieve either its stated or unstated aims : it has not forced iran to renegotiate the nuclear_accord from which president_trump unwisely withdrew ; nor has it ended iranian aggression in the middle_east or caused the regime of ali_khamenei to collapse . now it may result in a powerful new blow to u.s. interests , in the form of an iranian partnership with china that could rescue iran 's economy while giving beijing a powerful new place in the region .   an agreement approved by iranian_president_hassan_rouhani last_month could lead to billions_of_dollars in chinese_investments in iran , in exchange for a steady and discounted stream of iranian_oil ,   according to the new_york_times   . the deal also envisages security cooperation , including joint_military_exercises and the sharing of weapons development and intelligence , according to an 18 - page draft the times obtained .   it 's not certain the pact will go forward : it has yet to be publicly unveiled and must be approved by the iranian parliament , where it could encounter nationalist resistance . but if it does , it will not only rupture the wall of sanctions that the trump_administration has constructed in an attempt to strangle the iranian economy ; it will also mark a significant escalation of china 's challenge to u.s.global_influence .   as with the mounting u.s. conflict with iran , that was not inevitable . the regime of xi_jinping supported the pressure campaign against iran conducted by the obama_administration as_well_as the nuclear_accord it led to , which was meant to restrain iran 's uranium_enrichment and other nuclear development for a decade or more . even after mr. trump_withdrew from the deal in 2018 , beijing at first generally adhered to the new u.s. sanctions , reducing oil purchases and other trade .   yet mr. trump 's confrontational approach to china in recent_months , including his refusal to continue work on a comprehensive trade_deal , has given mr. xi little incentive to cooperate_with washington 's geopolitical priorities . on the contrary , the chinese leadership likely perceives a moment of critical u.s. weakness as mr. trump flounders amid a health_and_economic_crisis and is moving to take_advantage . it is expanding its presence in the south_china_sea ; it is crushing hong_kong 's autonomy .   allying itself with the foremost u.s. adversary in the middle_east opens yet another front .   mr. trump and his aides have directed plenty of bluster at china in recent_weeks , and secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo offered more when the prospective iran - china accord came up at
china 's growing_footprint in the middle_east recent_years have witnessed a marked change in the nature of commercial competition in the middle_eastern ( me ) region .   conventional players such as usa and its major allies ( uk , germany , france , netherlands ) are facing_immense pressure and new challenges as_a_result of china 's growing_footprint in the middle_east .   a report by the besa center says that china 's trade with regional_countries in 2018 - 19 was more_than $ 294 billion .   the investment_portfolio also observed a rapid_increase to $ 93 billion during 2013 - 2019 .   besides china 's growing_footprint in the middle_east , china also promised at china - arab forum in 2018 to invest_$ 23 billion in the oil_and_gas sectors .   major_beneficiaries of the chinese investment are saudi_arabia , iran and uae , with promises of even more generous packages of investment in future .   , beijing plans_to_invest almost $_10_billion in the oil and minerals such as copper sectors .   both countries also capitalized on the visit of the crown_prince_muhammad_bin_salman to china , when they signed various economic deals and mous worth_$ 28 billion in february_2019 .   now , china has finalized a comprehensive 25 - year deal worth_nearly_$ 400_billion with iran . this level of financial commitment by beijing as part of its belt_and_road_initiative ( bri ) , particularly to the context of its growing geo - stratetic divergences with the us - led west , could in fact be a game_changer for the region .   the major_reason of the its enhanced_cooperation with the middle_eastern_countries is china 's desire to work abroad through mutually_beneficial_economic ventures , and without interfering in other countries ' internal_matters .   the covid-19 - induced impact is likely to open_new_avenues of cooperation between china and the middle_east because of the havoc that the pandemic has played with the economy across_the_globe .   the middle_east is_no_exception either , which according to international_financial_institutions will be severely_hit , especially the oil exporting and tourism - based economies .   as the consumption of oil is declining due to lockdowns and the closure of industries , restrictions on mobility have also badly_impacted tourism in most parts of the world .   , for example , predicted in april 2020 that the cumulative losses of the me & northern africa would be around $ 323 billion and the worst_hit would be the oil exporting_countries of the me , primarily because of lower oil_exports .   these scary projections will have implication not only for the people of the me countries but also for many others across the world .   in these circumstances me would be looking for avenues to support its economy and china has the capacity to provide the requisite

venezuela opposition asks u.n. not to send observers to may vote venezuela opposition asks u.n. not to send observers to may vote   caracas ( reuters ) - venezuela 's opposition alliance called on the united_nations on monday not to send observers to the presidential_election on may 20 to avoid legitimizing a poll it says is rigged in favor of socialist president_nicolas_maduro .   maduro , who is seeking re - election amid an economic_collapse that has sent a tide of migrants to neighboring_countries , has asked the united_nations to send observers to the vote .   the main_opposition coalition is boycotting the election on the grounds that the elections council has historically favored the ruling socialist_party , and because the best - known candidates have been jailed or barred_from holding office .   " what we have asked the united_nations today is not to validate the electoral fraud in may , " said legislator Delsa Solorzano of the broad front coalition at a small demonstration_outside a u.n. office in caracas .   she added that any u.n. mission should " be only for human_rights issues , not to validate a dictatorship . "   a u.n. spokesman contacted via_email said the government 's request for a mission had been received .   " but our position on all such matters is that the sending of electoral observers requires a mandate from one of the un 's member state bodies " such as the security_council or general_assembly , wrote spokesman farhan aziz haq .   " if the ( general_assembly ) or the security_council were to provide a mandate , we would respond accordingly . but neither has done so up until now . "   opposition_leaders are planning a protest on saturday to demand better conditions for the upcoming vote .   former state governor henri falcon has broken with the coalition and will run against maduro , insisting that maduro 's low opinion_poll numbers make him a weak candidate . critics_say the government is likely to manipulate the vote results and that participating will legitimize the process .   maduro says his government is the victim of an " economic war " led by the opposition with the help of washington . his critics_say the country 's problems are the result of dysfunctional socialist policies .   reporting by vivian Sequera and brian Ellsworth ; editing_by peter Cooney

corporate political donations clash with company causes as the world expects more of corporations , it is untenable to support social and environmental causes while giving money , even indirectly , to candidates who oppose them .   vice_president_mike_pence visiting a walmart distribution_center in Gordonsville , va. , in april .   anna Moneymaker / the new_york_times   for putting their health at risk to work during the pandemic . at&t   . microsoft is undertaking one of the country 's most ambitious corporate efforts to   at_a_time_when corporate_america is speaking up on some of the most_important issues of our time , there is a contradiction_between companies ' words today and the role they played in helping create the moment we_find_ourselves in .   an examination of political spending over the past_decade shows how those companies   and dozens of other fortune_500 corporations   quietly funded political efforts that are antithetical to their public stances . they financed state_attorneys_general seeking to undo the affordable_care_act , which has provided health_insurance for millions_of_americans during the pandemic ; they provided funds that backed local legislators who tried to roll_back l.g.b.t.q. rights ; and they gave money that supported candidates challenging federal climate_change initiatives .   uniquely , public companies are the biggest benefactors of key political committees supporting the campaigns , donating more_than individuals or other groups .   the analysis of donations by the center for political accountability , a nonpartisan organization that tracks political disclosures , reveals many of the contradictions : walmart is among the companies that donated_money to the republican attorneys_general association , which supported a group of state_attorneys_general including ken Paxton of texas , who was narrowly re - elected in 2018 and is now leading a group of republican - run states in a supreme_court case that seeks to overturn key_aspects of the affordable_care_act .   at&t , which says its policies prohibiting discrimination_against employees based on sexual_orientation date back to the 1970s , provided funds to the same group , which helped elect pat McCrory in north_carolina in 2012 . mr.

Strayer is the us deputy_assistant_secretary for cyber and international communications and information policy . he leads development of international cybersecurity , internet , data , and privacy_policy and negotiations with foreign governments for the united_states . a big part of Strayer 's job involves getting allies and other countries over to the us side to invest in non - huawei equipment and components for 5_g_networks .   asked specifically what airtel , Voda idea , bsnl should do given dependencies on chinese gear , Strayer spoke to the realities of technology life_cycle and depreciation as a way to " migrate " away from " untrusted vendors to trusted vendors " .   " our campaign is focused on the move to 5_g , but we realize the legacy 3_g_and_4_g infrastructure will underpin the move to 5g. so we do encourage governments and telecom_operators just to look at how they can start moving , migrating away -- that is , from untrusted vendors to trusted vendors . "   the us has praised Telefonica in spain , orange in france , jio in india , Telstra in australia , sk and kt in south_korea , NTT in japan , and the telecom_operators in canada and singapore for their decision to only use " trusted vendors " in their 5_g deployments .

coronavirus : why wo_n't india admit how covid-19 is spreading ? coronavirus : why wo_n't india admit how covid-19 is spreading ?   india still denies it 's seeing community_transmission even as cases_surge   rajesh_kumar , 45 , started coughing in early june . within days , he was running a high_fever .   he did_n't get tested for coronavirus . instead he took anti - fever medication for five days . but the fever persisted , and soon he had difficulty_breathing .   his family asked him to get tested , but he refused . his rationale was that there_was_no way he could have contracted covid-19 because he had hardly stepped out of his house in delhi , and he had not met anybody who had the virus or was even suspected_of_having it .   eight days after the symptoms first appeared , his_condition_deteriorated . he was rushed_to_hospital , where he tested_positive .   " i survived , but doctors told_me that any more delay in hospitalisation could have cost me my life , " he says .   mr kumar has n't been able to track the source of his infection and is still unsure how he caught it .   experts_say there are many such cases - proof that " full - blown " community_transmission is happening in india .   india 's healthcare_system has struggled_to_cope_with rising cases   but the government refuses_to_accept that community_transmission has begun , saying there_is_no clear_definition of the term , and each country can define it based on local conditions .   so_far , kerala and west_bengal are the only two states to accept that they have entered this stage .   but global understanding on the subject is simple : when the source of infection ca_n't be traced in a large_number of cases , it 's safe to define it as community_transmission .   say the same : " community_transmission is evidenced_by the inability to relate confirmed_cases through chains_of_transmission for a large_number of cases " .   this is certainly happening in india , according to dr arvind kumar , chairman of the centre for chest surgery at delhi 's sir Gangaram hospital .   he says that more and more patients are turning up at hospitals whose source of infection can_not_be traced . and , he adds , the rising case_numbers support this .   india has recorded more_than 1.2_million cases and nearly 29,000 deaths .

google takes_aim_at amazon . again . the company is unveiling another initiative to compete more effectively with amazon 's e - commerce business .   google said thursday that it would waive sales commissions on google shopping and allow retailers to use third - party payment and order management services .   google is getting serious about competing with amazon in online_shopping   just as it did in 2013 , 2014 , 2017 and 2019 .   but in 2020 , as the coronavirus_pandemic continues to grip america , the push to create an online_shopping marketplace to compete with amazon has taken on new urgency as consumers are avoiding stores and turning to the internet to fill more of their shopping needs .   that it would take steps to bring more sellers and products onto its shopping site by waiving sales commissions and allowing retailers to use popular third - party payment and order management services like shopify instead of the company 's own systems . currently , commissions on google shopping range from a 5 percent to 15 percent cut depending on the products .   google is usually the starting_point for finding information on the internet , but that is often not the case when consumers are searching for a product to buy . more consumers in the united_states are turning first to amazon to find products that they plan to purchase . this has allowed amazon to build a rapidly_growing advertising business , which is a threat to google 's main financial engine .   google 's seven - year battle to take on amazon has had more lows than highs . in 2013 , it started   , a service offering_free same - day delivery . it offered $ 95 annual memberships for faster delivery , and it tried delivering groceries . google eventually scrapped the efforts .   evolved_into an online mall   filled with top retailers like target and best buy . in 2017 ,   to its virtual mall , but the partnership was short - lived . last_year , google ditched google express for google shopping and   to allow shoppers to use credit_cards stored with the company to complete the transaction without leaving the search_engine .   this year , google brought in bill ready , a former executive at paypal , to be its president of commerce and to compete more successfully with amazon .   google shopping had already eliminated the cost of listing and selling products on the site .   google announced in april that it would allow anyone to list products for free on its shopping site , reversing its previous policy of requiring sellers to buy an ad for products to appear . the company also announced that those

"   leader_of_the_opposition in the national_assembly and pmln president shahbaz sahrif took to the twitter to comment on the court_verdict :   " sc_judgment in the case against khawaja_brothers is a stinging indictment of the nab & so - called accountability_process which was more of a witch - hunt against them than accountability . their perseverance & determination is laudable . "   nab has not_yet_commented on the judgment .   khan won power last_year vowing to root_out_corruption among what he cast as a venal political_elite and views the probes into veteran politicians , including jailed former_pm_nawaz_sharif and ex - president_asif_ali_zardari , as long_overdue .   while few dispute the need to clean up pakistani politics , the nab campaign has become a topic of fierce political debate .   some in the business_community also worry the anti - graft drive is hurting an ailing_economy , which has received

popular chinese - made drone is found to have security weakness researchers found a potential vulnerability in an app that helps power the drones , highlighting u.s. officials ' concerns that beijing could get access to information about americans .   researchers found a vulnerability in an android_app that controls drones made by china - based da jiang innovations .   fred Dufour / agence_france - presse   getty_images   cybersecurity researchers revealed on thursday a newfound vulnerability in an app that controls the world 's most_popular consumer drones , threatening to intensify the growing_tensions_between china and the united_states .   in two reports , the researchers contended that an app on google 's android operating system that powers drones made by china - based da jiang innovations , or dji , collects large_amounts of personal_information that could be exploited by the beijing government . hundreds_of_thousands of customers across the world use the app to pilot their rotor - powered , camera - mounted aircraft .   the world 's largest maker of commercial drones , dji has found itself increasingly in the cross hairs of the united_states government , as have other successful chinese_companies . the pentagon has banned the use of its drones , and in january   decided to continue grounding its fleet of the company 's drones over security fears . dji said the decision was about politics , not software vulnerabilities .   for months , u.s. government officials have stepped_up warnings about the chinese government 's potentially exploiting weaknesses in tech products to force companies there to give up information about american users . chinese_companies must comply_with any government request to turn over data , according to american officials .   " every chinese technology company is required by chinese law to provide information they obtain , or information stored on their networks , to chinese authorities if requested to do so , " said william r. evanina , director of the national counterintelligence and security center . " all americans should be concerned that their images , biometrics , locational and other data stored on chinese_apps must be turned over to china 's state security_apparatus . "   the drone vulnerability , said american officials , is the kind of security hole that worries washington .   the security research firms that documented it ,   located outside washington , found that the app not only collected information from phones but that dji can also update it without google reviewing the changes before they are passed on to consumers . that could violate google 's android developer terms of service .   the changes are also difficult for users to review , the researchers said , and even when the app appears_to_be closed , it awaits instructions from_afar , they

chinese dream : xi 's attempted coup against pakistan chinese dream : xi 's attempted coup against pakistan   china 's communist leader has managed the creation of a supra - constitutional cpec_authority   xi_jinping is all set to sideline the democratically_elected representatives and civil_servants of the people of pakistan so as to expand his direct influence over the political and economic processes of the country .   since 2016 , xi , the general_secretary of the communist_party_of_china has been forcing the pakistani_establishment to put_pressure_on the government ( it was nawaz_sharif 's government back then ) to sideline the planning ministry 's role in the implementation and monitoring of the multibillion - dollar china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) .   xi pushed for the creation of a supra - constitutional cpec_authority that would freelance the management of the predatory infrastructure and power - generation projects under his direct command .   the proposal was rejected then , but last_year it was again presented before the prime_minister of the country   now imran_khan . the reason given was timely_completion of the projects .   this time the prime_minister is a full - fledged puppet of the military_establishment , and therefore it was easier than before to manipulate the law to fulfill xi 's desire to take over the planning ministry of pakistan , and in future the country itself .   chinese_president_xi_jinping shakes_hands_with pakistani prime_minister_imran_khan ahead of their meeting at the great_hall_of_the_people in beijing in 2019 . photo : afp   i consider pakistan 's ministry of planning , development_and_special_initiatives one of the most crucial state_institutions , whose senior_bureaucrats could implicitly scrutinize and resist xi 's draconian cpec scheme , as they had access to all of the secret_documents on the agreement and were involved , directly_and_indirectly , in the decision - making process .   so long as the reins were under the control of civilian institutions led by representatives of the people and civil_servants , thorough accountability of xi 's master_plan at_least at some level and at some point in time   if not at once   was possible . sidelining the civil institutions altogether would allow xi to play on both_sides of the board .   the agreement was so highly confidential that even the secretary of maritime_affairs once refused to show it to the senate_standing_committee_on_finance . so one can imagine what an above - the - law sort of deal it must be .   the cpec_authority was established in october_last_year using a presidential_ordinance ( without parliament 's approval ) for four_months and then was given another four - month extension . but xi wants permanent control . and now that the establishment has its puppet in the prime_minister 's house , it is putting all of its efforts into making

covid-19 crisis shifts cybersecurity priorities and budgets by Venky anant , jeffrey caso , and andreas Schwarz   cybersecurity technology and service_providers are shifting priorities to support current needs : business_continuity , remote work , and planning for transition to the next normal .   few corporate functions shifted priorities   so much and so quickly when the covid-19 crisis struck as corporate cybersecurity operations and the technology providers that support them did . as legions of employees suddenly found themselves in a work - from - home model , chief information - security officers ( CISOs ) adjusted , pivoting from working on routine tasks and toward long - term goals to establishing secure connections for newly minted remote workforces . CISOs also took steps_to_prevent new network threats that target remote workers and to bolster business - facing operations and e - commerce after a surge in online_shopping during pandemic lockdowns .   the response to the crisis continues to press department budgets and limit resources for other , less essential functionsa situation that we believe will direct spending in fiscal_year_2021 , which many departments are beginning to plan for . according to new mckinsey research , overall spending should taper off from the sector 's recent rapid_growth in industries that were hit_hard_by the covid-19 crisis while holding steady in industries that have not been as affected .   the challenges that cybersecurity organizations face have spilled_over to technology providers . those companies have done their_own pivots to keep up with customers ' shifting needs and to institute new ways of doing_business . to succeed in the post - covid-19 era , technology providers must rethink their strategies and offerings to accommodate a new security landscape . and they must continue_to_monitor customers ' needs and adjust sales , service , and training accordingly .   covid-19 crisis 's impact on cybersecurity spending   CISOs responded to the pandemic by quickly instituting measures to   maintain business_continuity and protect against new cyberthreats   . to manage continuity , they have been patching remote systems over virtual private networks ( vpns ) that have strained under increased loads . they have been monitoring spiking threat levels , including a near - sevenfold increase in spear - phishing_attacks , since_the_pandemic_began . remote workers are also being_bombarded with attacks based on covid-19 - crisis themes that are taking_advantage of delayed updates to email and web filters , and using social engineering to prey on workforce concerns .   many CISOs ' fiscal 2020 budgets had_already_been allocated before the pandemic , so to cover the cost of addressing the crisis , they had to put other projects on hold . according to our research , which covers more_than_250 global CISOs and security professionals , the crisis - inspired security measures will remain top budget

"   it was this non - apology and not his original outburst , Ocasio - cortez said on thursday , that led her to make her own speech , in which she eviscerated yoho 's use of familial pablum and domestic   with women as evidence of his respect for them . Ocasio - cortez pointed_out_that she , too , was someone 's daughter , and that that did_not in any way insulate her or other women , also daughters and wives , from the impact of degrading and sexist diminution .   " you can have daughters and accost women without remorse , " Ocasio - cortez said . " you can   project an image to the world of being a family man and accost women without remorse and with a sense of impunity . it happens every day in this country . "   the electric speech gave ringing voice to the experiences , frustrations , and anger of millions of women and men who have had their days , lives , and realities shaped by often abusive , sometimes vulgar expressions of patriarchal power . among Ocasio - cortez 's talents as a politician is her ability to connect and communicate clearly , intellectually , and emotionally , with masses of people ; the speech she

sustaining and strengthening inclusion in our new remote environment , ruth Imose , stephanie Madner , and Rens van den Broek   thoughtful action now can help teams build new habits , strengthen connections , and encourage the growth of inclusive cultures that will better realize the full potential of all employees .   has become_commonplace globally . the dramatic workplace changes introduced in response to covid-19 have provided organizations the opportunity to reset team dynamics . this major_shift can , and   , also serve as a catalyst to embed more inclusive practices and more effective leadership_skills . since working_remotely could become permanent for some employees in the next normal , organizations and teams should not miss this opportunity to introduce new , valuable habits .   we define inclusion as the degree to which organizations embrace all employees and enable them to make meaningful contributions .   an inclusive work environment does_n't just happen ; it requires sustained_effort ( see sidebar , " inclusion , defined " ) . stresses from covid-19 and extended isolation are driving a range of negative emotions in employees . on top of that , recent prominent examples of racial_injustice have affected many employees in ways that can_not_be left_behind when work begins . this_is_especially_true for black employees . while the systemic nature of racism demands systemic action , individual actions are an_important_part of supporting employees and ensuring they can continue to make meaningful contributions . team leaders have an_important_role_to_play .   why inclusion matters more_than_ever   during times of crisis , the focus on inclusion becomes ever more critical , but addressing it is n't always as straightforward as it might initially appear . for instance , individuals can have mixed views on how inclusive their workplace is . employees may feel that their employer 's overall environment is generally not inclusive ( perhaps because of perceived inequitable access to resources or support ) but their personal_experiences may reflect inclusion based on frequent interactions with their team and immediate supervisors .   accordingly , an inclusive environment can_not_be_achieved solely through systemic efforts , such as identifying and addressing unconscious bias and unintended_consequences in formal processes . an inclusive environment is created in equal part by the behavior of individuals ( leaders and peers ) , who make conscious inclusion a daily practice . effective people management demands inclusive behavior , not least because inclusion leads to better_outcomes and can support foundational business goals :   win the war for talent .   recent mckinsey research found that 39_percent of all respondents say they have   turned_down or decided not to pursue a job because of a perceived lack of inclusion   increase retention of critical talent .   are three times_more_likely to think about leaving their jobs .

" the country is rapidly gaining investors ' attention for_a_variety_of_reasons in recent_years " , he said while_talking_to_app here on tuesday .   world_bank ( wb ) has recently highlighted that the global investment is expected to be reduced by almost_40_percent both in 2020 and 2021 and the growing economies_of_developing_countries are likely to be worst - hit in terms of low fdi by the pandemic .   however , as per recent statistics issued by state_bank_of_pakistan , the negative_impact of covid_19 on fdi into pakistan is not significant so_far , rather pakistan attracted net fdi of us$ 2.281 billion as compared to us$ 1.006 billion compared to the correspondence period of fy_2018 - 19 ( jul - april ) .   the world_bank ( wb ) has also projected a 23 percent_decline in remittances for pakistan , totaling_about_$ 17 billion in 2020 compared with a total of $_22.5_billion in 2019 due_to_the_economic_crisis_induced by the pandemic , and lockdowns in most cities abroad .   however , despite these projections , things can be turned around with carefully_crafted strategies and finding opportunities in new areas .   the advisor said that the country has successfully_managed to overcome the security challenges ; the infrastructure has significantly_improved , connectivity with western china is in its final_stages , a new deep - sea_port is being developed , reform drives are being recognized around the world ; and the long - term economic_outlook remains positive .   prime_minister himself is leading the reforms to facilitate investors and to ensure ease_of_doing_business , he said .   razak said that recently , pakistan has announced transformational visa reforms by introducing e - visa facilities to most of the countries .   replying_to_a_question , he said that with the current positive_developments and government 's focus on inviting private investments in key_sectors including information_technology and enabled_services , food_processing , textile and logistics among others , many of pakistan 's bilateral_ties around the world are shifting from transactional relationships to mutually_beneficial_economic partnerships .   replying_to_another_question , he said that due to covid-19 , " we are facing a truly unprecedented_situation in the human history affecting millions of human_lives and the economic_activities "   razak said that in the last 5 years inflow , outflow and net fdi to pakistan has some time increased and decreased ,   he further said that covid_19 has

the main planks in a counter - china policy situation along the china - india border in ladakh   region is still tense . the disengagement_process is proving difficult , and the latest meeting of the corps_commanders on july 14 has not resulted in any demonstrable progress regarding troop_disengagement / de - escalation . india is standing firm on both_sides ensuring_complete disengagement_of_troops along_the_line_of_actual_control ( lac ) , while china is laying emphasis on strengthening confidence_building_measures in the border_areas , and proper handling of border issues in a timely_manner to " avoid differences becoming disputes " .   china has crossed its 1960 claims along_the_lac   details regarding the actual ground_situation , meanwhile , remain sketchy , lending itself to differing interpretations . however , it would appear that this time around , china is intent on managing the ground_situation to its advantage , and bring about a realignment of the lac . with the idea of ' buffer_zones ' having been accepted   which apparently are to be located on indian_territory   it would appear that china is well on its way to achieving its objective . if china does succeed , it could be for the first time that china has a foothold on the west side of the kongka_pass .   analysis | with economic measures , india turns the tables on china   the events of may and june were hardly a ' one - off manoeuvre ' . a great_deal of planning would have preceded the incursions across the lac at_multiple_points , several_hundred kilometres apart . however , what prompted china 's aggressive_behaviour is unclear , but it had the effect of shredding the painstakingly devised border agreements of 1993 , 1996 , 2005 and 2013 . whether china is behaving_like an ' irredentist power ' seeking to expand its frontiers to the limits that existed in the qing_dynasty , or as an ' expansionist power ' ( as the prime_minister obliquely hinted which produced an instant reaction from beijing , warning india against making " a strategic_miscalculation with regard to china " ) , is less critical than what china 's current objectives are . undoubtedly , humbling india in the eyes of asia and the world was all important . india needs to ponder deeply on this , to avoid making a strategic_miscalculation during a difficult_period .   analysis | with china , india will have to be ' atmanirbhar '   the 21st_century was once heralded as the asian_century , with china and india in the vanguard . rumour has it that as far back as 1988 , chinese leader , deng_xiaoping , had mentioned to then indian prime_minister , rajiv_gandhi , that he doubted this . if so , deng has been prescient , for in the 21st_century the two_asian_giants have been more

omar_abdullah writes on scrapping of special_status to jammu_and_kashmir and article_370 having been a member of the most empowered assembly in the land and that , too , as leader of that assembly for six years , i simply can not and will not be a member of a house that has been disempowered the way ours has : vice_president of the jammu_and_kashmir   national conference breaks his silence .   it 's almost a year since the tectonic changes of august_5 , 2019 , were forced on the people of jammu_and_kashmir without so much as a by your leave . it 's still impossible to come_to_terms_with what i saw being rolled_out on my television set that morning . hours earlier , at the stroke_of_midnight , i had been placed_under_house_arrest , and would be shifted to a government guest_house by the end of the day . the nominated representative of the union government usurped powers , that should have been vested with the legislature and a popularly elected government , to rewrite j&k 's constitutional relationship with the rest of india . the parliament of india spent less_than a day each in the lok_sabha and the rajya_sabha to change more_than_70 years of history , to undo the sovereign commitments made to the people of j&k and to dismember the state .   after the re - election of prime_minister   , rumours started to float about the intentions of the   to use its absolute_majority in the lok_sabha to implement its poll promise of abrogating   of the constitution . fears reached a fever_pitch when plane loads of central para - military forces where flown in to srinagar and dispatched all over the state .   the people were treated to categorical denials by the occupant of the highest office in the state , the governor , that j&k 's special_status faced no threat . he debunked the rumours , explained away the additional forces suggesting they were required for assembly_elections later in the year . so what does one conclude from this ? that the occupant of such a high office deliberately lied to the people or that he was n't kept informed ? i know what i believe but you can draw your own_conclusions . some of us , senior office - bearers of the j&k national conference , had a meeting with the pm just days before the august_5 developments . it 's not a meeting i will forget in a hurry . one day i may write about it but propriety precludes me from saying more_than that we left the meeting with a completely_different impression about what was going to unfold in the next 72_hours .   in one fell swoop , everything we had feared came to pass .   j&k 's special_status , an important ,

" i sometimes say that in my last life maybe i was chinese . "sen .   as media , intelligence_agency , and political scrutiny of foreign meddling is seemingly at its apex , a story with big national_security implications involving a high - ranking senator with access to america 's most sensitive intelligence information has been hiding in plain_sight .   the story involves china and the senior u.s. senator from california , and former chair of the senate select_committee on intelligence , democrat Dianne feinstein . it was buried eight paragraphs into a recent   on foreign efforts to infiltrate silicon_valley , as a passing example of political espionage :   former intelligence officials[said ] chinese intelligence once recruited a staff_member at a california office of u.s. senator Dianne feinstein , and the source reported back to china about local politics .

india coronavirus : life - saving covid-19 drugs sold on delhi black_market there is widespread hope that remdesivir could treat_covid-19   a bbc investigation has found that two life - saving drugs used_to_treat covid-19 patients in india - remdesivir and tocilizumab - are in short_supply and being_sold for excessive rates on a thriving black_market . vikas pandey reports from the capital delhi .   abhinav sharma 's uncle had very high_fever and difficulty_breathing when he was admitted_to_a_hospital in delhi .   he tested_positive_for_coronavirus and doctors told the family to get remdesivir - an antiviral_drug that 's been approved in india for clinical_trial and also under " emergency use authorisation " , meaning doctors can prescribe it on_compassionate_grounds .   but procuring it proved an impossible_task - remdesivir did_not_seem to be available anywhere .   mr sharma desperately called people to arrange for the drug as his uncle 's condition_deteriorated by the hour .   " i had tears in my eyes . my_uncle was fighting_for_his_life and i was struggling to arrange the medicine that could possibly save him , " he said .

" i_do_n't_know who was responsible , " he said . mr. Milewski was   by some of a touch of racism for even raising the matter . no unturbanned politician would have had to endure such a grilling , the critics charged .   but mr.

"   the article went_on_to_say_that a pro - pakistani lobby remains_active in bangladesh and tries to influence bangladesh 's foreign_policy , prioritising pakistan and not india , which stood by bangladesh during the liberation_war .   asked about this , foreign_minister_ak_abdul_momen said the media can write a lot_of_things , but questioned_whether they were based_on_facts .   on the content of his meeting with the pakistani_envoy on july_1 , he told_the_daily_star that for nearly two years pakistan did_not have a high_commissioner_in_dhaka , and the new envoy , after presenting credentials in february , was just making a courtesy call .

" it is a very institutionalized process . before every corps_commander talks , the agenda is approved in delhi . there is a meeting of the china_study_group which sits down and approves what the commander can propose and agree to . he is an instrument in the process , not the decision - making authority , " the government official said .   agreement with china on early , complete_disengagement : india   after the last round_of_talks at the level of the corps_commander on july 14 which failed_to_break the deadlock , there was a view within the government that there was a need to keep the chinese off - balance in the next round_of_talks , as beijing seemed to be comfortable with the new status_quo on the border .   this view was based on the argument that if military_options are ruled_out and india is prepared for a prolonged_standoff and winter deployment , it should not accept any half - measures or proposals for partial disengagement on the lac at_this_stage .   " there was a view that we should adopt a strong and rigid posture on our demands for restoration_of_status_quo_ante . at_this_stage , we should show our stubbornness , we need to keep the chinese off - balance , not comfort them , " an official_told the sunday express .   the consensus in the government , however , seems to have veered around the continuation of its existing strategy of the past 12 weeks of the standoff . it rules out any use of military_options , either as a quid_pro_quo action or in any other form of military leverage , while focusing on the end goal of restoration of the status_quo_ante .

marsha blackburn paper on china : u.s. needs to secure critical supply_chains sen. marsha blackburn white_paper on china : u.s. needs to secure its critical supply_chain   sen. marsha blackburn ( r - tn ) on wednesday   a white_paper that outlined the threats the chinese_communist_party poses to the united_states in the wake of the coronavirus_outbreak in wuhan , china , and recommended 129 steps the u.s. could take to address those threats .   " people want_to_see china held_accountable . they want us to come_forward with ways to significantly change our relationship_with_china . and they do_not_want china to be a beneficiary of the american consumer or of our government , " blackburn said during a conference call .   one of the white_paper 's key recommendations was for the united_states to move its critical supply_chains out of china .   the manufacturing of active_pharmaceutical_ingredients ( api ) outside the u.s.   and increasingly in china , poses a national_security risk , the paper said .   according to the paper , 72_percent of api manufacturing takes_place outside the u.s. , andthe number of facilities making apis in china has more_than_doubled since 2010 .   " the covid-19 pandemic exposed two major vulnerabilities baked into the united_states ' current pharmaceutical supply_chain : an overall susceptibility to drug shortages , and a lack of control over supply so severe as to constitute a national_security risk , " it said .   the food_and_drug_administration ( fda ) , on a list of supply - chain shortages due to the covid-19 outbreak , noted three antimicrobial drugs in clinical_trials for efficacy against covid-19 : azithromycin , chloroquine , and hydroxychloroquine , the paper said .   " because the u.s. remains dependent on foreign sources of api , these and other critical drugs could easily move from a shortage situation into nonexistence , " the paper warned .   a defense health agency ( dha ) senior_official said the agency remains " concerned about any situation where foreign actors , such as china , control substantial access to critical warfighting materiel and potential serious risk of interruptions in the supply_chain or posed_by 30 contaminated apis . "   even before the covid-19 outbreak , the fda 's center for drug evaluation and research ( CDER ) director dr. janet Woodcock warned of the need to safeguard the pharmaceutical supply_chain , calling the cessation of american manufacturing of apis a key health and security concern , the paper said .   TheU.s.-china economic and security review commission has also assessed that there are " serious deficiencies in health and safety_standards in china 's pharmaceutical_sector " due to a poorly regulated industry , beijing 's refusal to cooperate_with routine inspections , and outright fraud in chinese manufacturing , it added .

the ideal and the real the ideal and the real   will imran_khan be pakistan 's first prime_minister to last a full term ?   that was one of the first questions that perplexed my_mind when i learned to read as a primary_school child the urdu of the newspaper   . the word was ' gormint ' . it also appeared in daily bulletins of ptv that my   used to watch in our family home in a small punjabi city , sargodha . we could set our invisible watches to his entry in my_uncle 's room where some of us assembled for the pre-6 pm cartoons .   some of the most familiar sounds in my_childhood were that of woody Woodpecker 's shrill cackle , shaista zaid 's flawless news - reading in her impeccable british english , Popeye the sailor 's strange baritone , and azhar lodhi 's flawless urdu in the 9 pm main news_bulletin . cartoons and gormint formed a fascinating mix in my life before my precocious mind understood the unique irony of it all .   my first real memory of politics was zulfiqar_ali_bhutto 's speeches . without understanding much of what he said , or the connotation of his fiery , passionate oration , i remember watching him riveted once i could focus on things that were not food or playing with my cousins . it was all because of my_mother , living in her village , Kolo tarar , after her separation from my_father . my ami was a bhutto supporter . all i remember is her saying that bhutto was " different " , and that he would change things .   in 1977 , one of my_maternal uncles , one of my_mother 's half - brothers , won a national_assembly seat on bhutto 's pakistan people 's party ( ppp ) ticket . there were fireworks . everyone stayed up late , happy . Kolo that night was uncharacteristically noisy .   when i was nine_years_old , general_zia - ul - haq appeared as the new gormint on television . i did_n't understand what a military_coup was , but zia scared me . he was also the man with the stern face who took away bhutto 's voice from my_mother 's black - and - white philips tv . that made me sad .   my next vivid memory of politics was bhutto 's hanging on april 4th,1979 . for years , i remembered reading   ' headline , ' za_bhutto hanged , buried in naudero . ' did my young mind change the words or was this the exact headline that kept popping_up like an_indelible sliver of a recurring nightmare in my_mind since then , i_do_n't_know . bhutto was buried in the silence of night . there_was_no public funeral

" the neutralising antibody_response of the vaccine in mice and non - human primates was comparable with the sera from the convalescent patients of covid-19 , above the us - fda recommended titre of 1:160 for neutralising antibodies , " the statement said .   further advantages of HGCO19 are its mRNA platform design and delivery vehicle .   " the vaccine is likely to go for trials before the year - end , " the statement said .   Renu swarup , secretary of dbt and chairperson of biotechnology industry research assistance council ( BIRAC ) , a psu under the dbt , said diseases emanating_from unknown and new pathogens require novel ideas for effective mitigation .   " Gennova 's m - rna platform supported by dbt utilises the advances in nucleic_acid vaccine and delivery_systems . this vaccine_candidate that makes use of nanotechnology has shown promise to be effective in animal models . with the kind of capacities Gennova has , i_am_confident_that this vaccine_candidate can be rapidly scaled_up , once proven_effective in human clinical_trials , " she said .   speaking on the development , ceo of Gennova Biopharmaceuticals ltd sanjay singh said , " bold moves are necessary to create globally_competitive and sustainable_solutions . Gennova appreciates dbt - BIRAC initiative , guidance , and financial_support towards the development of mRNA - based next - generation vaccines . "   the
does china pose_a_threat to global rare_earth supply_chains ? as china 's economy has developed over the last several decades , its leaders have sought to transform the country into a key_player in strategically_important industries . toward this end , beijing has established china as the dominant global supplier of rare earths , a collection of 17 minerals that are indispensable to the manufacturing of smartphones , electric_vehicles , military weapon_systems , and countless other advanced_technologies .   beijing has demonstrated a willingness to leverage its weight in the global rare_earth industry in pursuit of its political_objectives , raising_alarm bells in several major countries . however , china 's influence within the industry is likely to be eroded in the coming years as changing market_dynamics empower new actors to compete .   the global_marketplace for rare Earths   the global rare earths trade is relatively_small compared to other commodities . in 2019 , the value of worldwide rare_earth imports_stood_at just $_1.15 billion   a fraction of the more_than $_1_trillion in global crude_oil imports . the total value of goods_produced using rare earths , however , is immense . each apple_iphone , for example , relies on   rare_earth elements . Neodymium is used to make tiny , yet powerful , magnets that allow iphone speakers to function . Europium is used in trace amounts to produce red colors on screens , and cerium is used to polish the phones during the manufacturing_process . during the 2019 fiscal_year , apple sold   despite their name , most rare_earth elements are relatively abundant . the process of mining rare earths and transforming them into usable materials is , however , expensive and damaging to the environment . for years , beijing exploited its relatively_low - cost labor_force and lax environmental_laws to gain a competitive_edge in the global market and become the leading supplier of rare earths . from_2008_to_2018 , china exported nearly   of rare earths , which amounted to 42.3 percent of all rare_earth exports over the period . the united_states was the second - largest_exporter , supplying roughly 9.3 percent of the global total . malaysia ( 9.1_percent ) , austria ( 9.0 percent ) , and japan ( 7.1 percent ) rounded out the top five .   china 's general_administration_of_customs   , china exported 45,552 metric_tons of rare earths worth_$ 398.8 million in 2019 . the vast_majority of these exports went to the world 's major economic and technological powerhouses . about 36_percent ( by volume ) went to japan , making it the top destination of chinese rare earths . the us was a close second , taking in 33.4 percent of chinese exports . alongside the netherlands ( 9.6 percent ) , south_korea ( 5.4 percent ) , and italy ( 3.5_percent ) , these five countries imported
what mike_pompeo does_n't_understand about china , richard_nixon and u.s. foreign_policy what mike_pompeo does_n't_understand about china , richard_nixon and u.s. foreign_policy   secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo speaks at the richard_nixon presidential library on july_23 in Yorba linda , calif. ( ashley Landis / ap / pool )   richard haass is president of the council_on_foreign_relations and author of " the world : a brief introduction . "   secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo delivered   a blistering speech about china   on thursday . the problem was not simply that the nation 's chief diplomat was decidedly undiplomatic . worse was his misrepresentation of history and his failure to suggest a coherent or viable path_forward for managing a relationship that more_than any other will define this era .   the secretary asked what americans have to show for 50 years of " blind engagement " and said the answer was little_or_nothing . he instead erected a straw man : u.s. policy failed , he said , because china did_not evolve into a democracy when , in fact ,   the purpose of the policy developed by richard m. nixon and henry_kissinger   was to use china as a counterweight to the soviet_union and shape china 's foreign_policy , not its internal nature .   what 's more , their efforts largely   . in cementing china 's split from the soviet_union , the united_states gained leverage that contributed to the cold_war ending when and how it did .   yes , china continues to flex its_muscles in the south_china_sea , but pompeo failed to note it has not fought_a_war   with another country since its 1979 border_conflict with vietnam   . importantly , china has not used force against taiwan , which has emerged as a thriving democracy .   pompeo also sought to commit the united_states to a path that is bound_to_fail . it is not within our power to determine china 's future , much less transform it . to be sure , the country faces enormous_challenges : an aging society that will soon start shrinking dramatically , a badly_damaged environment , an inadequate public_health system , an unsustainable economic model that relies on massive_amounts of investment for growth , and a top - heavy leadership that stifles creativity and has difficulty correcting its mistakes .   but all this and more   including the role of the chinese_communist_party   will be for the chinese people and their leaders to determine . for now , to paraphrase donald Rumsfeld , pompeo and his colleagues need to negotiate with the chinese government they have .   what the united_states can and should try to do is shape china 's choices , to bring about a china that acts with a degree of restraint at_home_and_abroad and that works with us

china 's meteorological satellites help pakistan monitor desert_locusts beijing , jul_22 ( app ): the satellite_data and meteorological data_provided_by china 's meteorological satellites can_be_used to monitor pakistan 's desert_locusts and provide early_warnings to relevant_parties , a source from china meteorological administration ( cma ) said , adding that cma has released special reports on remote_sensing data of locust_attacks in pakistan .   " china 's fengyun series satellites can generate information for analysis of a locust - affected area by monitoring rainfall , soil_moisture and land surface_temperature ( LST ) changes of the african and south_asian_countries " , cma noted , explaining that a hotter and wetter climate favours more multiplication of locusts , and studies have also linked wind_direction , speed , and other weather parameters to the migration_of_locusts , china_economic_net ( cen ) reported on wednesday .   according to an update issued by the food_and_agriculture_organisation ( fao ) of the united_nations ( un ) , the summer_breeding of desert_locust_swarms has commenced in pakistan 's tharparkar , nara_and_cholistan deserts where hatching_and_band_formation_will increase later this month . on top of monitoring the breeding and movement of the locust_swarm , fengyun satellites are helpful when_it_comes_to the assessment of vegetation damage . locust_swarms ravaged crops and pastureland , destroyed food and vegetation and jeopardized food_security across africa , the arabian_peninsula , and parts of south_asia . fengyun-3 ( fy-3 ) polar orbit meteorological satellite , therefore , is used to monitor how the crops are growing . with the monitoring data generated by fy-3 , pakistani scientists can offer remote_sensing - based assessment of vegetation damage in locust - invaded areas .   as per cma , pakistan_meteorological_department ( pmd ) has been using data_collected from china 's CMACast , an updated satellite_data broadcast system based on digital video broadcasting   satellite   second generation ( DVB - S2 ) with both file and multimedia transmission capability since 2006 . they have regularly posted maps sensed by fengyun-2E ( fy-2E ) satellite online for various disaster prevention and mitigation authorities . in addition , data_collected_by china 's meteorological information comprehensive_analysis and process system ( MICAPS ) has been used by pakistan to analyze and forecast weather for relevant_institutions and the public .   china on june 5 , 2018 launched the fy-2H meteorological satellite to improve the accuracy of weather_forecasting and provide better meteorological services to countries participating in the belt_and_road_initiative ( bri ) , cma told_china_economic_net . the number of countries using fengyun satellites data has increased to 108 ( including 75 countries involved to bri ) by may 2020 , and 30 countries have established earth stations to transmit and receive information to and from fengyun satellites .   court to appoint_a_legal_representative on behalf of kulbhushan_yadav ?   youtube might get banned in pakistan   pm khan ninth - most

state of play : is videogame development on the rise in pakistan ? state of play : is videogame development on the rise in pakistan ?   with a target market of 2.3_billion gamers worldwide , new opportunities within game development have opened up locally .   Videogames stand as one of the most_influential and largest consumed mediums present .   Videogames stand as one of the most_influential and largest consumed mediums present   with an_approximate target market of over 2.3_billion gamers worldwide . it accounted_for a   of over $ 137.9 billion in 2018 , up by 13.3 % from the previous year .   pakistan ( international game developers association )   estimates , upto $_25_million in revenue is earned locally across the industry each year ; with more_than_8,000 professionals associated with videogame development .   yet , videogames , and in particular videogame development in the country , has always flown under the radar . but somewhere within these numbers lies pakistan 's modest gaming industry . this story is about that .   coming of age : from consumers to developers   the journey of videogame development in pakistan started sometime around the 2000s   when teenagers who had played and experienced games from what is formally_known_as the 3rd and 4th_generation of videogame development internationally , started to become young_adults .   this generation , that had grown up on early pcs , nes , Sega , Atari and Commodores , soon found that it was n't satisfied with being a mere consumer . it was clear to many of them that a new medium was rising , one where pixels and gameplay were telling a story , replacing the simple and unadorned use of moving images or words .   initially , the concept of videogame development started off with ' modding ' existing games .   games like counter - strike and unreal tournament were being actively played in lan ( local area network ) cafes , with easily_accessible ' world editors ' that one could use to modify and tinker levels and features . so it did_n't take long for the pioneering generation to get its hands on some of these modifying features , resulting in the occasional use of custom game maps based on familiar localities on old LANs , which were built by internet_service provides or by private individuals .   the first few studios that popped_up around_the_same_time were   in lahore , that solely focused on small mobile games and indie pc titles .   the early bird catches the worm   since the target market segmentation for indie gaming was not mature and crystalised enough   and videogame development studios located internationally were creating content of a much_higher production value

a ban on good sense a ban on good sense   the recently_passed punjab_tahaffuz - i - Bunyaad - i - islam act provides sufficient cause_for_concern to anyone invested in the intellectual and cultural climate of this country . there are several aspects of the legislation that elicit consternation , but i want to focus on three in particular : the first is the deference to unilateral executive_authority on issues_related to cultural production and consumption ( book selling , publishing , distribution ) ; the second is the renewal of state - sanctioned efforts at socialising and disciplining populations through regulation of the intellectual domain ; and the third is the straitjacket that legislation such as this one places on the entire political process .   that pakistan is still a deeply bureaucratised state is obvious to all . everything from formulation of policy , design of projects , to implementation and administration is tied to bureaucratic authority with only semblances of participation - based accountability . nowhere is this more apparent than in the way urban_centres in this country are run   ie at the whims of insular civil and military bureaucrats .   what has_become_increasingly apparent over the years from this bureaucratisation of public life is that it leaves little space for oversight and accountability . these terms tend to be associated with acts of malfeasance carried_out by politicians , but the reality is that much of pakistan 's governing structure   from decision - makers to implementers   is opaque and unaccountable . what this new legislation has done is place an entire domain   one central to the cultural life of an entire society   into the hands of yet another bureaucratic office with marginal provision for transparency and oversight .   beyond the more precise identification of terrorist_acts , racial animus , and glorification of violence , the act provides purposefully vague guidelines on what_constitutes objectionable_material in published form . clause 3e , for example , relates to obscenity and forbids the publication or distribution of " any material that is in conflict with commonly accepted standards of morality and decency " . what are these commonly accepted standards that are simultaneously so obvious and yet elude any codification ? ( the correct answer is there are none and granting authority to a single office to determine their scope is a recipe_for_disaster ) .   who bears the cost of these controls ? obviously not the generation that is making these decisions .   of further concern is the fact that the only external oversight actually guaranteed by the act is to the muttahida_ulema_board on books in which the subject_matter is ' religion ' . by this and the metric mentioned , works now considered central to the canon of urdu_literature , such as

time forthe us to stop supporting pakistan 's military rule u.s. aid to pakistan 's military has helped keep civilian governments in the country weak .   dod photo by army sgt . amber i. smith   the election of former cricket star imran_khan as pakistan 's next prime_minister comes at a pivotal_moment . khan must decide_whether he will try to break the pakistani military 's stranglehold over policymaking and institute much_needed reforms , or preserve the status_quo and become the generals ' charismatic puppet . unfortunately , the current u.s. policy of supporting the country 's military at the expense of its civilian government risks nudging him in the wrong_direction .   pakistani democracy is often seen as a "   . " the military enjoys a virtual monopoly over foreign and economic policy , and the country 's parliament is dismissed as a mere patronage scheme , which preserves family fortunes and perpetuates tribal dominance . but western critics often fail to appreciate how their_own governments have undermined the country 's democratic_institutions and empowered its unelected military rulers .   u.s. policy in particular has cultivated the military 's outsized influence . since the cold_war , washington has regarded pakistan as little more_than a security bulwark , first against the soviet_union and then against jihadists after 9/11 . tens_of_billions_of_dollars in u.s. aid have   into pakistan in recent_decades , the vast_majority directed at strengthening the military and coaxing it to cooperate withU.s. counterterrorism_efforts . a   from harvard 's belfer center found " a systemic lack of supervision in the provision of aid to pakistan and the incentivization of u.s. taxpayerfunded corruption in the pakistani military and security services . " it 's no_wonder the pakistan army   flush with american aid dollars   is now the most_powerful part of the government .   far from serving u.s. interests , however , this strategy of strengthening pakistan 's military has backfired spectacularly .   the military has shown little commitment to fighting terrorists . ( remember when osama_bin_laden was founded hiding a thousand yards from pakistan 's equivalent of west point ? ) instead , it exacerbates the conditionsthat contribute to terrorism in the first place . pakistan 's military siphons away state resources and fails to alleviate the destitution and isolation in the tribal_regions where the taliban thrive . in the name of national_security , the generals have plunged their military into a dangerous nuclear competition with india . the military fosters deep ties to the taliban and the haqqani terrorist network , which it hopes will act as pro - pakistani proxies in afghanistan afterU.s. troops finally go home .   it 's true that that the civilian government is beset_by patronage and corruption . but as a national celebrity untethered to the dynastic

life in kashmir after article_370 life in kashmir after article_370   this special report analyses insights gathered by the author from different sections of the kashmir public regarding the impact of the abrogation_of_article_370 on their lives . the interviews were supplemented_by secondary sources , primarily news reports in the national and international media after 5_august_2019 , when the bharatiya_janata_party ( bjp)-led government of india_abrogated the enforcement of article_370 of the constitution , which since 1950 has given near - autonomy to the state of jammu_&_kashmir ( j&k ) . on the basis of these findings , this report makes recommendations for the way_forward .   Ayjaz wani , ' life in kashmir after article_370 ' ,   orf special report no . 99   , january_2020 , observer_research_foundation .   the long - drawn armed_conflict in kashmir has claimed_thousands_of_lives and made the economy bleed , and has posed grave threats to the country 's security . it was in 1989 when the insurgency was born , as an indigenous movement against the corrupt governance and autocratic_rule of sheikh_abdullah . externally , too , kashmir has long been a bone_of_contention_between_india and pakistan ; the two_countries_have_fought four wars over the valley . the insurgency has ruined the normal_functioning of the state , and has forced new_delhi to notify the erstwhile_state_of_jammu_and_kashmir ( j&k ) as a " disturbed area " and invoke controversial and draconian_laws like the armed_forces_special_powers_act ( afspa ) to maintain_peace . though new_delhi tried to occasionally reach out to pakistan and even to kashmiris over the years , but for some brief periods of hope , peace has not prevailed in the kashmir_valley .   following the precedent set by his_predecessors , atal_behari_vajpayee and manmohan_singh , prime_minister_narendra_modi has also tried_to_reach_out to pakistan . for two years from his swearing - in ceremony in 2014 , modi made overtures to find a peaceful_resolution to the conflict over kashmir . he invited nawaz_sharif , the prime_minister of pakistan , for his swearing - in ceremony , and made an unscheduled landing in lahore on christmas 2015 to greet his counterpart on his birthdaya move that defied diplomatic convention and stunned foreign_policy experts .   however , the excitement over a possible turnaround in india - pakistan relations was short - lived . the beginning of 2016 saw a terror_attack on the pathankot air_force_station , involving five jaish - e - mohammed terrorists . months of tension followed the attack , escalating in the subsequent months after the killing of popular militant leader_burhan_wani in an anti - insurgency operation in august 2016 . within hours of the encounter , streets in south kashmir became theatres of violent_protests and stone - pelting . burhan 's killing reignited the calls for   and opened_the_floodgates for homegrown insurgency , as scores of the local youth joined terror_groups .
uscirf : china trains its ' orwellian surveillance state ' on christians the chinese government has created " an orwellian surveillance state with an unprecedented ability to gather private information about its citizens , " which it is now using to monitor christians , the u.s. commission_on_international_religious_freedom ( uscirf ) reported wednesday .   the uscirf conducted a virtual   wednesday on " the chinese government 's use of surveillance and data analytic technology to oppress religious_groups " and how the u.s. government should respond to this latest attack on religious_freedom .   the independent , non - partisan commission observed that the chinese government has " installed hundreds_of_millions of surveillance_cameras across the country , using facial and voice recognition systems to distinguish and track uyghurs and tibetans .

" however , that is not what_we_are_seeing today in china , where the communist_party is deliberately using technology to undermine religious_freedom and other fundamental_rights . "   for his part , vice_chair tony perkins   that the chinese_communist_party ( ccp ) uses artificial_intelligence systems combining information from video surveillance , facial and voice recognition , gps tracking , and other data " in order to track certain religious_communities .

pakistan yet to receive foreign_aid worth_$ 21.6b thursday , 19 nov 2020 |   Naveena steel : strengthening your_dreams   multiple_challenges and need for unity and wisdom   state , government and the people   delay mostly due to long project completion periods , systemic inefficiencies   a staggering $ 21.6 billion_worth of foreign economic assistance has remained undisbursed due to the long completion period of projects and also because of systemic inefficiencies that have put an extra_burden on pakistan in the shape of commitment charges on idle money .   out of the $ 21.6 billion , there was $_3.9_billion worth of foreign grants that the international_donors committed to giving to pakistan but remained undisbursed due to multiple_reasons , showed official_statistics of the ministry_of_economic_affairs .   the remaining $ 17.7 billion were relatively_cheap loans that pakistan contracted at 1.25 % to around a 3 % interest rate .   pakistan can swiftly mobilize at_least one - fourth of the undisbursed money by simplifying its approval processes , removing bureaucratic_hurdles and fast - tracking the contract award process , according to sources in the multilateral lending_agencies and the ministry_of_economic_affairs .   official_data of the economic_affairs_ministry showed that the undisbursed balance of foreign loans_and_grants stood_at_$ 21.6 billion as of june 2019 . there was a reduction of $_2_billion or 8.6 % as compared to the preceding year when the amount stood_at_$ 23.6 billion .   these loans_and_grants remain undisbursed at_a_time_when the government and the state_bank_of_pakistan ( sbp ) have embarked on a risky path of building foreign_currency_reserves by taking expensive loans . contract agreements for the $ 21.6 billion_worth of loans_and_grants have_already_been signed with the international_lenders and donors .   finding it an easy_solution to deep - rooted problems , the last pakistan muslim_league - nawaz ( pml - n ) government had also embarked on the dangerous path of taking conventional and unconventional loans to prop_up official foreign_currency_reserves and meet its external requirement .   the sbp has also adopted a risky path of attracting hot_foreign_money by keeping interest_rates higher_than the level needed to contain inflation . the ministry_of_finance is also in the process of hiring financial_advisers to raise billions_of_dollars in the current_fiscal_year by floating eurobonds and sukuk .   some of these loans have not been disbursed due to a long gestation period of different projects . for instance , $_3.4_billion was outstanding against the karachi nuclear_power projects , which took a long time for completion .   however , billions_of_dollars committed by the world_bank and the asian_development_bank ( adb ) remained_stuck due to public - sector inefficiencies .   usually , the planned project completion period is three to four years except for hydel and nuclear_power projects but government agencies take about seven to eight years .   another reason for the

" yousuf was working in kuwait at the time , and his_wife was living along with their son and two younger daughters in hyderabad . in his complaint , yousuf said that he learnt from his son about fathima 's extra_marital relationship with Faiyaz ; and the subsequent abuse and torture he was subjected to by fatima and Faiyaz for keeping him quiet about it , "   the court has reportedly found Faiyaz guilty of attempt_to_murder , unnatural offences , punishment for wrongful confinement , adultery , criminal_intimidation , and the sections of the protection of children from sexual_offences act . meanwhile , fathima has been convicted for attempt_to_murder , punishment for wrongful confinement and criminal_intimidation .   as per the report , rehman and fathima had married in 2006 . they lived in kuwait with their children till 2013 .

india planning to join obor to attract massive chinese_investments ? after years of opposition , can india join china 's one belt , one road ( obor ) initiative to attract massive chinese_investments ? india seems to have altered its strategy by rejecting to align with us , japan_and_australia to counter the obor project of china ? us , japan_and_australia recently_launched an initiative to escalate opposition to china 's obor project , but india surprisingly remained at bay .   has japan started to support china 's obor proactively ?   will africa be the battleground or hub for india - china collaboration ?   india has had its_own share of concerns and resentment to china 's obor project specifically with regards to the cpec . the cpec_passes_through pakistan_occupied_kashmir ( pok ) and india holds strong_objections to this route .   india feels that cpec challenges the sovereignty of india and its claim over kashmir . besides this , the success of the obor will also mean that india 's claim to be a regional superpower in asia will take a backseat . but new_delhi is determined to not annoy beijing any further and hence it has diluted its fierce resentment to the obor .   the us , japan_and_australia plan to invest more in infrastructural_projects in asia and the indo - pacific to counter china 's growing stature . they launched a trilateral partnership on july 30 to work towards this direction . india maintained a cautious distance from this partnership and did_not participate in the initiative . india is not keen to make its stand on the indo - pacific seem overtly hostile towards china .   after the fierce standoff_at_doklam between_india_and_china , the two neighbours have held a series of negotiations and dialogues to ease strains between them . during the visit of the chinese defence_minister to india later in this month , the two nations will also discuss the possibilities of setting_up a military hotline .   even in the recently_concluded brics_summit in south_africa , the two nations were confident of bringing diplomatic_ties back_on_track . both share concerns_over the increasing protectionism of the us and in such a scenario both look for opportunities to stitch strategic_partnerships and complement_each_other . this may be the reason_why india wants to play safely in terms of its policies towards beijing .   more news at eurasian_times   indian military_base in Sabang can strangle china at the strait_of_malacca   why is japan unhappy with bullet_train project in india ?   can china 's j-20 or russian_su-57 really match the us f-22 Raptor ?   russian_su-57 or american f-35 : who is winning the global fighter_jet market ?

indian matchmaking only scratches the surface of a big_problem only scratches the surface of a big_problem   the netflix dating show updates the arranged_marriage narrativebut leaves the custom 's major problems untouched .   every reality show has at_least one villain . in   a prospective bride who 's critical of every man she meets and vocal_about disliking things like the beach , relaxing , and podcasts . early on , she tells the camera she has n't regretted a decision she 's made since the age of three . in her finest moment , presented with a suitor with a sense_of_humor , she sighs : " you know how i hate comedy . "   as insufferable as she seems . but her apparent unsuitability for the dating world makes her a perfect subject for   as she tries to get every_single and reasonably_well - to - do indian in her path married to a heterosexual partner of her , and their parents ' , choosing .   okay , i 'm being a little flippant . as sima and the show itself frequently remind us , arranged_marriage is not quite the form of social control it used to be ; everyone here emphasizes that they have the right to choose or refuse the matches presented to them . but as becomes especially clear when sima works in india , that choice is frequently and rather roughly pressured by an anvil of social expectations and family duty .   in the most extreme case , a 25 - year - old prospective groom named   is practically bullied by his mother ,   into choosing a bride . somehow , she claims , akshay 's failure to choose a bride by the ripe old_age of 25 is a disappointment to his parents , an obstacle to the conception of his older_brother 's as yet nonexistent firstborn baby , even a drag on preeti 's own physical health . she breaks_out her home blood_pressure monitor , telling him that her high numbers are a direct_result of the stress he 's causing her . i 've always thought of my_mom as a champion of desi guilt , but preeti really puts her to shame . ( it should be said that despite all of this , akshay says on the show that his ideal bride is " someone just like my_mother . " )   smartly reclaims and updates the arranged_marriage myth for the 21st_century , demystifying the process and revealing how much romance and heartache is baked into the process even when older_adults are meddling every_step_of_the_way . but for me , at_least , the show 's value is as a vibrant validation of how brutal the gauntlet of indian matchmaking can bea practice that begins with your parents ' friends_and_relatives

british reparations : let 's ask for it british reparations : let 's ask for it   british_colonial past   as a story of unethical rulers wringing the natives dry not only of their economic wherewithal but also destroying its entire sub - structure on which the entire civilisation rested   has already been a forgotten story , post - independence . if anything , the brutal past has not only been air - brushed in our history_books , the british have been projected as " benign benefactors " .   even_though leaders like dadabhai naoroji and writers like will durant had highlighted long_ago about the huge economic drain foisted on india by their british masters during their rule , a discussion on india asking for reparations from the british for the same has started only in the last_couple_of_years .   in all probability , it was congress_leader shashi_tharoor , who first made a speech at oxford_university , and then , was pushed by his publishers to write a book : " an era of darkness : the british_empire in india " .   it talked_about how more_than 35 million people were killed or lost_their_lives in bloody reprisals , artificially_created famines , instigation of riots etc .   from commanding a 23 per_cent share in the world gdp before the advent of the british , india was left at less_than 3 per_cent share , when they left .   recently , another research by Utsa patnaik , which has been published by the cambridge_university press , has argued that the british owed $ 45 trillion to india for their economic drain . this , when continued to lie through their teeth that india was actually a drain on their economy .   the demand for reparations , or an_apology , from the countries perceived to have committed war_crimes or other kind of atrocities has been a feature of european politics after the world_war - ii . germany , vilified for its nazi past , has virtually been at the forefront of those offering apologies . chancellor_angela_merkel seemed to have started a trend , as it were , since 2008 .   even the vatican often come_up_with apologies on various issues , including that of sexual_abuse_of_children in their churches , and other topics .   in the eastern region , japan has been seeking forgiveness for its excesses in the world_war - ii almost continuously for the war_crimes like forcing korean women to be " military sex_slaves " ; euphemistically called " comfort women " .   one of the enduring features of these apologies is that the victim side has made it a point not to forget those horrors . by making a village out of the scrap of bombs ( dropped by japan ) ; keeping the
why population control law is need_of_the_hour ? why population control law is   indias population stands at nearly 140 crore and this rapidly_growing population is the obstacle to her economic_development . it is not possible to reduce the existing size of population but it is possible to slowdown the rate at which population is increasing , writes vivek bansal .   the sudden_outbreak of the pandemic has given us a reality_check as to where we stand vis - a - vis our resources and the population dependent on it . the spread of the deadly_virus and the subsequent economic breakdown has proved that as a country we have failed . it is not because of the government policies or the inefficiency of the government but because of its huge population . the lock_down brought to forth the huge_number of unskilled labor_force that migrates to towns_and_cities in search of lively hood . it is not that the government does_not_want to do something but the fact is that they are not sure with their limited_resources as to how much infrastructure should be created .   both developing & developed_countries have_not_been_able_to live up to the pledges they made at un conference on population & development in cairo in 1994 . the result is in front of us ; it is a saga of immense suffering , especially of women , 350,000 of whom die in pregnancy & childbirth each year .   as of now , indias population stands at nearly 140 crore . and this rapidly_growing population is the obstacle to her economic_development . we do not have a magic_wand to reduce the population , even if we put everything in place it will take generations to bring it under control . agreed it is not possible to reduce the existing size of population . but it is , of course , possible to slowdown the rate at which population is increasing .   us sanctions 11 chinese_companies over uyghur persecution in xinjiang   oxford Universitys covid-19 drug shows positive_results in clinical_trials   overpopulation iscausing more problems . medical conditionsare getting_worse anddiseasesare spreading_faster . more and more indians are living below thepoverty line . a bigger family means increased costs and reduced savings and in todays fast_moving life and cut throat competition not many would prefer that . development of infrastructural facilities is unfortunately not keeping pace with the growth of population . as a major_chunk of the funds is spent in meeting the basic_requirements . the result is lack of transportation , communication , housing , education , healthcare etc .   the pressure of unwanted population_growth increases the army of unemployed youths of employable age . the situation has become more alarming in these pandemic times . just think of it , at_a_time_when there are layoffs and people are losing_jobs with companies

mexican migration could be the first crisis of 2021 mexican migration could be the first crisis of 2021   the pandemic_has_worsened all the factors driving migrants north , not least from mexico .   blog_posts represent the views of cfr fellows and staff and not those of cfr , which takes no institutional positions .   since 2017 , more thanone millionCentral americans have made their way to the u.s. southwestern border , triggering a disjointed but brutal_crackdown by the administration of president_donald_trump . although the combination of tighter border_controls and the coronavirus has reduced these flows , they will resume when the covid-19 lockdowns lift .   only this time , mexicans are likely to join the exodus . the resulting tensions could destabilize one of the world 's most tightly woven bilateral relationships , jeopardizing cooperation on everything from counternarcotics to water rights and the prosperity that closer_ties have underpinned on both_sides of the border .   mexican migration to the u.s. peaked at the turn of the last century . at the end of the 1990s and early_2000s , hundreds of thousandsof mexicans moved north every year , many evading border sentries along the way . they fanned_out across the nation , drawn to enclaves in california , texas , illinois , and arizona , but also to newer locations : colorado , florida , georgia and idaho . and many switched from seasonal work in the fields to more permanent year - round jobs in childcare , landscaping , hotels and car services .   latin_america 's moment analyzes economic , political , and social issues and trends throughout the western_hemisphere .   by the mid-2000s , the exodusslowed . for the past_15_years , more mexicans have left the u.s. than come each year . this shift reflects economic progress at home , not least an end to the financial booms and busts of the 1980s_and_1990s . beefed - up enforcement at the u.s. border has also discouraged circular migration , with workers now rarely returning_home for a few_months between planting seasons .   better schooling also helped . with the number of years of education nearlydoublingsince 1990 , the average mexican 16 - year - old is in class , not the workforce . so have changing demographics : starting in the 1980s mexican families have had fewer kids , now averaging just overtwoper household . compared with the 1990s , fewer mexicans are turning 18 every year and searching for work either_at_home_or in the u.s.   but in place of mexicans came a swelling wave of central americans , driven by poverty , violence and devastating droughts due to climate_change . the majority have been women_and_children , pulled , too , by the presence of family , friends and economic_ties in the u.s.  
spain : court_hears testimony on whether assange was spied on spain : court_hears testimony on whether assange was spied on   spain 's national court is due to hear testimony monday in an_investigation_into whether a spanish company was hired to spy on julian_assange during the seven_years the wikileaks founder spent in the Ecuadorean embassy in london .   spain 's national court is due to hear testimony monday in an_investigation_into whether a spanish company was hired to spy on julian_assange during the seven_years the wikileaks founder spent in the Ecuadorean embassy in london . the court is investigating whether david morales , a Spaniard , and his undercover global s.l. security agency invaded the privacy of assange and his visitors at the embassy by secretly recording their meetings . the intelligence that morales ' company collected is suspected of being handed_over to third parties , according to court papers .   among those set to face the court 's questions monday were prominent spanish lawyer Baltasar Garzn , who is part of assange 's legal_team ; former Ecuadorean consul in london fidel Narvez ; and stella morris , a legal adviser and assange 's partner , who revealed earlier_this_year that she had two children with him while he lived in the embassy . staff of the spanish security company are due to testify on tuesday .   assange , whose lawyers filed_a_complaint at the court to trigger the investigation , is in a british prison after being removed from the embassy last_year . he is fighting extradition to the united_states , where he faces espionage_charges over the activities of wikileaks .   the court is conducting an investigation , begun last_year , before_deciding whether there is evidence of wrongdoing that warrants a trial . undercover global , also_known_as uc global , was hired by ecuador 's government to provide security at the Ecuadorean embassy in london between 2015 and 2018 . its main task was to secure the property 's perimeter , including the deployment of security staff , due to assange 's presence inside , court papers say .   according to the national court_summons seen by the associated_press , the preliminary_investigation has raised suspicions that , under the cover of his security work , morales used bugging devices and video equipment to record assange 's meetings with visitors . they included his lawyers , politicians , journalists , medical_staff , Ecuadorean diplomats , the former head of ecuador 's national intelligence_service , Rommy vallejo , and longtime republican_congressman for california dana Rohrabacher .   morales passed on the recordings to third parties who are not yet identified . however , the court papers note allegations that the intelligence was passed to Zohar Lahav , described by assange 's lawyers as a security officer at las_vegas sands corp. , a u.s. casino

"   over 50 people were killed , majority of them muslims , in the communal_violence that shook parts of delhi in late_february . the law_and_order collapsed as the mobs ruled the streets of north - east delhi for three days leaving_behind a trial of death_and_destruction at a scale unmatched in decades .   the letter also raises_concern over the july order of the special commissioner of police ( crime ) alleged to be biased_towards hindu_community as it asked the officials to take " due care and precaution " while arresting youth from hindu_community citing " degree of resentment_among the hindu_community " .   the signatories of the letter include some veterans of the bureaucracy . these are : a.

experts denounce pompeo 's ' crazy ' speech , warn possible military clash by gt staff reporters source : global_times_published : 2020/7/24 14:43:37 last_updated : 2020/7/24 21:49:17   " clich " and " crazy " were words experts used_to_describe us_secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo 's latest speech in which he bluntly called on the chinese people and " free world " countries to " change " the communist_party_of_china ( cpc ) . the us is leaning further to a new_cold_war with china and escalating McCarthyism to a higher_level , experts said , noting that china should remain_alert to the possibility of military clashes with the us in the near_future .   during his near half - hour speech at the richard_nixon presidential library on thursday , pompeo attempted to paint china and the cpc as a threat to the " free world , " referring to the us ' persistent_efforts to make changes to china 's behavior . he also mentioned that previous engagements with china have failed , and accused china of taking_advantage of engagements with the us in order to cheat its way to power and prosperity .   pompeo 's speech , delivered in the run up to the 50th_anniversary of former us president_richard_nixon 's milestone visit to china in 1972 , aimed to establish the trump_administration 's latest china policy , said li_haidong , a professor at the institute_of_international_relations under the china_foreign_affairs_university .   but it was full of clichs and purposely overlooked the facts , li_noted , adding that the real_reason the us has changed its china policy is that the two countries ' comparative strengths have changed and the us is unable to tolerate china 's rise .   foreign_policy is generally announced when a new government begins its term . as there are now three_months before the us ' november_election , pompeo 's speech was clearly intended to support trump 's reelection bid , said li .   gao Zhikai , chair professor of Soochow university and vice_president of the center for china and globalization , who accompanied nixon during_his_visit to china in 1985 , told_the_global_times that by slandering previous bilateral_engagement , pompeo insulted the chinese people and americans dedicated to building a bridge between_the_two_nations .   pompeo also shows no respect to the achievements of bilateral_ties and overlooksthat better china - us ties benefit the two_sides , gao said , adding that the only appropriate thing pompeo could have done at the nixon library was kneel and apologize .   thursday 's speech came following recent addresses from other top us politicians including white_house national_security_advisor_robert o'brien , attorney_general_william_barr and fbi_director christopher_wray which established the us ' basic china policy_framework , experts said .   pompeo 's words were a total denial of the us ' four_decades of engagement with china and revealed that hawks in the us

" china strongly_condemns such an outrageous and unjustified move which will sabotage china - us relations . we urge the us to immediately_withdraw its erroneous decision . otherwise china will make legitimate and necessary reactions , " the foreign_ministry said .   china has also alleged that the us security harassed its diplomatic_staff and students and confiscated personal electrical devices and detained them without_any_reason .   the ministry_spokesman wang_wenbin claimed the

india , bangladesh , and pakistan grapple_with the dangers of chinese_apps and other social_media asian_countries are waking_up to t ...   banning individual platforms is like a game of whack - a - mole . coordinated and ethical regulations would make for smarter policy .   a military policeman checks his mobile_phone while on duty at Rajpath road in new_delhi on july_22 , 2020 .   xavier GALIANA / afp_via_getty_images   's south_asia brief . this week :   bangladesh moves_toward net neutrality   pakistan threatens to ban china 's tiktok   surge_past 1.8_million , and a   if you would like to receive south_asia brief in your_inbox_every thursday , please sign_up   why is south_asia pushing_back_against social_media ?   last_week it would prohibit so - called zero_rating of social_media_apps , a process in which cellular firms provide_free internet for the use of particular apps . the move is significant because it represents a victory for net neutralitythe principle by which internet_providers must not regulate bandwidth to favor one company over another . ( without net neutrality , your internet provider could strike up a high - speed deal with netflix , while slowing_down a competitor such as hulu . )   , bangladesh 's decision did_not_explicitly mention net neutrality , instead focusing on how zero_rating was " used by dishonest persons to carry_out unnecessary criminal_activities " and " creating unhealthy competition in the market . "   bangladesh 's decision will hurt facebook most of all by shutting_down its free basics program , which offered free internet to access facebook_and_whatsapp through a network of local partnerships . other than india , which banned free basics in 2016 , most other_south_asian_countries have yet to put net neutrality regulations in place . users of the program in bangladesh will now have to pay regular internet costs to access facebook , likely reducing the number of hours spent on facebook , whatsapp , and instagram .   the larger question is why bangladesh acted as it did , especially during a pandemic . one reason could be that facebook has dwarfed other local e - commerce platforms in bangladesh . according to a   , a new technology website , facebook is responsible for about 80_percent of internet commerce .   meanwhile in pakistan , the national telecoms regulator has   a " final_warning " over explicit_content on the video_app_tiktok , owned by china 's bytedance . india banned_tiktok last_month , along_with_58 other chinese - owned apps , in a move that was widely_seen_as retaliation for china 's incursions_into its territory . pakistan is a close_ally of china 's , making its move more surprising , especially as tiktok comes_under_fire from other countries over security_concerns .   the strange thing about the recent_spate of technology

how china 's influence extends deep into the uk economy from property to finance , infrastructure to technology , the two countries ' economies are closely intertwined   " no economy in the world is as open to chinese investment as the uk , " declared george osborne on a visit in 2015 . few western_nations would make such a claim today , but the then - chancellor was on an unapologetic charm_offensive that took him to beijing skyscrapers , and saw himinterviewedon bullet_trains and paradedin front of giant red_flags .   osborne batted away questions over human_rights_violations while claiming china stood up for free_trade . he even touted the expanding global presence of tech titan huawei as an example of how the ruling_communist_party had embraced free market capitalism .   " there is always more we could be doing with china because i see china as an opportunity not a threat , " he said on one of his visits .   china was the future and britain wanted to be front of the queue to reap_the_benefits .   the new " golden era " of uk - china relations that osborne hailed has lost its shine in the years since , however . old wounds stretching_back centuries to the opium wars have reopened while the very 21st_century issues of 5_g and tech infrastructure security have created new sources of tension .   kerry brown , a professor of chinese studies at king 's college_london , says relations were dominated by hong_kong up until the handover in 1997 and the uk , like other countries , has attempted an " engagement policy " since .   " under osborne and cameron , it became ' let 's go for investment and trade ' and not get bogged_down in complex arguments about values , " he says .   " the thing we_are_seeing now is the end of this engagement policy china has not been what people thought it would be . "   relations with beijing have hit a low not seen in decades . chinese technology   will be ripped out of british infrastructure   amid_fears that beijing is using the likes of huawei to spy on the west .   meanwhile china has said there will be " consequences " as_a_result of the uk 's opposition to it tightening_its_grip on hong_kong with a   . in 1839 , britain took the city state as part of an agreement with china to end the first opium war before handing it back in 1997 under the " one country , two systems " agreement .   but that agreement has wilted as beijing has undermined hong_kong 's independence .

exclusive : house republicans to force vote on sanctions against chinese officials who covered up coronavirus house republicans are expected to force a vote thursday on the floor on legislation that would sanction_chinese communist_party figures who silenced whistleblower doctors to conceal the true threat of the wuhan coronavirus .   house_democrats , however , under orders from house_speaker_nancy_pelosi , are expected to block the measure , thereby protecting the chinese officials who covered up the origins of the pandemic .   house gop leader kevin mccarthy 's team confirmed to breitbart_news that republicans will move to consider this legislation on thursday on the house floor . mccarthy intends to force a vote on a bill from rep. john curtis ( r - ut ) that would hold the chinese officials who covered up the coronavirus_pandemic accountable .   would " authorize the imposition_of_sanctions with respect to the deliberate concealment or distortion of information about public_health_emergencies of international concern , and for other purposes . "   the 12 - page legislation notes chinese dr. li_wenliang " warned his medical school classmates of an outbreak of an unknown sars - like virus " back on dec. 30 , 2019 . but on jan. 3 , 2020 , just a_few_days_later , " wuhan 's public_security_bureau detained , questioned , and forced dr. li_wenliang and seven other doctors to sign a letter confessing he had made ' false comments ' that ' severely disturbed the social order . ' "   later , on feb. 7 , 2020 , a month after he was admitted in wuhan_central_hospital , dr. wenliang died of a severe case of coronavirus .

xi_jinping has foreseen the future and china is ready to dump problematic pakistan for iran sebi proposes amendments to delisting regulations   central health team to visit gujarat on saturday   karnataka in dilemma over reopening_schools   northeast united fc take on mumbai city fc ( isl match 2 )   jagan promises to accommodate late tirupati mp 's son as mlc   pakistan has become a headache for china   following the inaccurate reports about iran pushing india out of the chabahar - zahedan rail_project , pakistan 's foreign_minister_shah_mahmood_qureshi could n't hide his obsession_with india . qureshi said that india was dropped out of the key rail_project due to india 's " wrong_policies " . the foreign_minister of the terrorist country   that india was spoiling its relations due to its " hindutva_mindset " .   qureshi 's claims are wrong . tehran has   that it is very much clear that it is still engaging with new_delhi for the chabahar_project . meanwhile , islamabad was celebrating false reports of india 's reduced role in iran due to chinese intervention , but the imran_khan government fails to realise that beijing 's increased influence comes at the cost of snubbing pakistan .   as the xi_jinping regime invests in iran , the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) faces the risk of getting jeopardised .   china has realised that iran is a much_better deal compared to pakistan . beijing wants to invest in this part of the world because it offers direct connectivity to the indian_ocean via the persian_gulf . this allows china to bypass the strait_of_malacca and indian influence in its oil_supplies and trading routes . in this sense pakistan holds equal , or in fact , lesser strategic value than iran .   iranian_ports are closer to the most_important oil choke - point of the world- the strait_of_hormuz and this gives china an added advantage . from a geo - strategic point_of_view iran is slightly better   moreover , from a practical standpoint , iran is in a much_better option than pakistan . the china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) stands threatened due to the baloch struggle_for_independence and india 's growing assertiveness about gilgit - baltistan . china 's main investment in pakistan is the 62_billion dollars cpec initiative , which is also a part of xi_jinping 's flagship- bri .   the cpec originates_from china - occupied xinjiang passes_through the indian_territory of gilgit - baltistan which is presently under the illegal_occupation of pakistan military and finally moves into the balochistan_province of pakistan , connecting china to the gwadar_port . cpec stands on thin ice because india   gilgit - baltistan . the day this happens , the cpec itself would get dysfunctional .   moreover , the chinese
rethinking the science of skin august 3 & 10 , 2020 issue   rethinking the science of skin   what is all the scrubbing , soaping , moisturizing , and deodorizing really doing for the body 's largest organ ?   skin , long seen as a barrier that should be sterile and pristine , is increasingly seen as a " complex , diverse ecosystem . "   photograph by Maisie cousins for the new_yorker   when my sister and i were young , we liked to come home from school and turn on " guiding_light , " a soap_opera on cbs . we only ever caught the last fifteen_minutes of the hour - long show , but , because it was n't particularly subtle , this was plenty of time to follow even its most involved plotlinessuch as when Reva Shayne , a nine - times - married character who had arcs as a talk - show host , a psychic , the princess of a fictional island , and a time traveller to the civil_war and nazi_germany , had to fight dolly , a devious clone that her most recent husband had made of her in order to spare her children from grief during the most recent of her presumed deaths .   " guiding_light " began , in 1937 , as a radio show to promote a soap called Duz . ( " Duz does everything . " ) when it went off the air , in 2009 , it was the longest - running show in broadcast history . it was owned , until the end , not by cbs but by procter_& gamble , which began as a soap company and has been credited with inventing modern advertising in america . in addition to promoting its brands with paintings on trolley cars and billboards , the company developed more_than twenty radio_and_television dramas . the first , " Oxydol 's own ma perkins , " premired in 1933 ; the last , " as the world turns , " left the airwaves in 2010 , by which time the term " soap_opera " had become freestanding . you could even watch them , as i did , without ever knowing they had_anything_to_do_with a soap company .   it was easy , until the   -19 outbreak , not to think very often or very deeply about soap . early in the pandemic , this began to change . we learned which pop songs had choruses that we could sing to keep us scrubbing for a full twenty seconds ; we learned that , at_least during the pre - lockdown_period , the lines outside men 's rooms grew suddenly longerlikely because ( according to one study ) only thirty - one per_cent of men had previously been in the

what is china doing to pakistan ? the same_thing it did to sri_lanka this article is more_than 2 years_old .   one day , china will turn pakistan into its_own " semi - colony , " as it did recently with sri_lanka .   china has been nice to pakistan , on the surface that is . it has been building the china_pakistan_economic_corridor ( cpec ) , which will connect western china with the indian_ocean , provided of course that india will allow it .   that could certainly benefit pakistan , helping the country make a big_step forward , fromanemerging to a mature economy , creating a lot of jobs in the process .   but it could hurt pakistan , too . like addingto pakistan 's corruption , which keeps pushing the costs of the project higher by the day , making pakistan more indebted to china , which has been financing the project .   rising indebtedness comes_at_a_time_when the countryisalready living beyond its means , as evidenced_by persistent current_account_deficits , government debt , and external_debt   pakistan recorded a current_account_deficit of 3867 usd million in the fourth_quarter of 2017 , according to   pakistan accumulated a government debt equivalent to 67.20 % of the country 's gross_domestic_product in 2017 . the country 's government debt_to_gdp averaged 69.30 % from 1994 until 2017 , reaching an all - time high of 87.90 % in 2001 and a record_low of 56.40 % in 2007 .   external_debt in pakistan jumped to 88891 usd million in the fourth_quarter of 2017 from 85052 usd million in the third_quarter of 2017 . the country 's external_debt averaged 53029.34 usd million from 2002 until 2017 , reaching an all - time high of 88891 usd million in the fourth_quarter of 2017 and a record_low of 33172 usd million in the third_quarter of 2004 .   meanwhile , pakistan 's foreign_currency_reserves and foreign capital_flows are falling , making it increasing likely that pakistan will seek to reschedule its debt to china . perhaps , by swapping debt with equity , which in essence will handle cpec to beijing .   that 's the model china applied in rescheduling sri_lanka 's debt , turning the country 's   china 's own port , for 99 years . that 's according   early last_year , which gives   china merchants ports Holdingsan arm of the chinese government70 % stake in   as was the case with cpec , the hambantota_port expansion   with loans from china . but when shri lanka could not pay back the loans , beijing converted these loans to equity , in essence turning sri_lanka into a " semi - colony , " in a subtle way .   that 's what will eventually happen to
cpec and digitalisation after covid-19 cpec and digitalisation after covid-19   digital silk_route connectivity would help the flow_of_information , financial_transactions and physical goods_and_services . it will also promote and facilitate regional_economic_cooperation and will enable many ict integration services between both countries .   the 820 - kilometer - long fiberoptic cableproject at_a_cost_of_$ 46 million , stretches from china 's western_xinjiang_region and enters pakistan through khunjerab border and then travels through gilgit_baltistan ( gb ) to mansehra , kp to connect to muzaffarabad , ajk and onwards to islamabad and rawalpindi , where it is connected with the existing optical connectivity_network of pakistan .   lahore wasa builds tank to store rainwater   in order to optimize existing and future coordination in the supply_chain within pakistan and with the chinese , digital silk_route connectivity would help the flow_of_information , financial_transactions , and physical goods_and_services . it will also promote and facilitate regional_economic_cooperation and will enable many ict integration services between both countries .   this connectivity spread from many soft to hard infrastructural_projects such as paperless trade_facilitation , e - commerce , e - government , playing a supporting role in the construction and management of industrial_parks , roads , rail , aviation , and ports .   on_the_other_hand , this cable connectivity will provide many opportunities to enhance people - to - people connectivity between china and pakistan . the adaptation of china 's digital terrestrial multimedia broadcasting ( DTMB ) technology is an indispensable component for socio - cultural collaboration .   the arrival of the DTMB standard in pakistan enables high_definition ( hd ) broadcasting for digital television ( tv ) which will provide many opportunities for the pakistani media industry for revenue_generation and promote many cultural_exchange programmes at a higher resolution between china and pakistan .   cpec fibre optics play_a_vital_role in unimpeded trade through the china - pakistan border . the digital infrastructural deficit in gb is one of the biggest hurdles for efficient cross - border trade_facilitation between china and pakistan through the khunjerab border .   the inception of a new fibre cable introduced the online weboc ( web_based one system ) custom system at the dry_port in gb , which is the first customs dry_port through which all cargo coming from khunjerab border must get cleared by pakistan customs before_entering the country .   it is recommended to have the proper_training for using this new system and address the queries of local traders before introducing new weboc at sust port and further integrate this new system with the chinese customs system . this will help reduce leakages in shipped goods and delay due to cumbersome documentation procedures of the old system and reduce the trade_facilitation problems persisting at the china - pakistan border .   laying the 820 - kilometre - long

chinese actions in xinjiang become a matter of international dispute chinese actions in xinjiang become a matter of international dispute   european_countries defend the uighurs of xinjiang , muslim countries do_n't   three years china 's government , citing national - security_concerns , has run relentless campaigns against the culture and religion of the uighur people , 11 m muslims who speak a turkic language and live in xinjiang , china 's north - westernmost corner . mosques have been shut . men are forbidden to grow beards , women may not wear head coverings and children are barred_from prayers . most troubling are the growing details emerging about a network of detention_facilities , which chinese officials call vocational - training_centres but which look for all the world like internment_camps . credible_reports say these are holding at_least 1 m peoplemostly uighurs but also chinese people of kazakh and kyrgyz ethnicityin extra - judicial detention .   until the middle of 2018 , chinese_diplomats managed to keep international criticism of the camps in check . at that point america 's vice - president , mike_pence , raised_concerns_about " round - the - clock political_indoctrination " . since then , the chinese have lost_their_battle to persuade foreign countries that xinjiang is purely an internal_matter , of no concern to anyone_else . but they have turned it into an issue that polarises diplomatic opinion . that polarisation has now burst_into the open .   on july 8th , 22 countries signed a letter to the   human_rights_council , calling on china to end the " mass arbitrary_detention " of uighurs and other muslims , and to allow international_observers access to detention_camps . this was the first concerted international_condemnation of chinese actions in xinjiang . signatories included most european_countries , canada , japan_and_australia but not the united_states ( see map ) , which withdrew from the council in 2018 . however , mike_pompeo , the secretary_of_state , later called china 's treatment of the uighurs " the stain of the century " .   days later , 37 countries , among them russia and saudi_arabia , responded with a letter of their_own , defending china 's policies on the grounds of fighting terrorism . some signatories were anti - western autocracies which can be relied_upon to rally round anyone that the west criticises . they include russia and venezuela . other signatories are western_allies , such as egypt and saudi_arabia , which oppose what might be called the global human - rights regime . they lock up plenty of their_own opponents on security grounds . still others are beneficiaries of chinese investment , such as pakistan and laos , which can not easily afford to bite the hand that feeds them .   most intriguing , however are gulf_states which back china for a combination of defence

pompeo says us should limit which human_rights it defends washington ( ap )   secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo argued thursday for a more limited u.s. view of global human_rights advocacy based on the principals laid out by america 's founding_fathers , a suggestion critics assumed meant stepping away from more modern concepts such as support for women and the LGBQT communities_around_the_world .   pompeo , speaking in philadelphia , singled_out property_rights and religious_freedom as " foremost " principals in a speech that elsewhere complained_about the " proliferation " of protections in international agreements related to human_rights .   " we are forced to grapple_with tough choices about which rights to promote and how to think about this , " he said . " americans have not only unalienable rights , but also positive rights granted by governments , courts and multilateral bodies . many are worth defending in light of our founding ; others are n't . "   pompeo on thursday released a report produced by the commission on Unalienable rights , which he tasked last_year with conducting a broad review of u.s. human_rights policy , arguing at the time that it had " lost its bearings . "   before its release , many human_rights_groups were skeptical of the commission , whose chairwoman was conservative legal scholar mary ann Glendon , a former u.s. ambassador to the holy see .   pompeo noted that the report emphasizes property_rights and religious_liberty . " no one can enjoy the pursuit of happiness if you can not own the fruits of your own labor . and no society can retain its legitimacy or a virtuous character without religious_freedom , " he said .   the report did_not produce any specific recommendations and steered clear of endorsing policy proposals . but experts who parsed it for direction noted , for example , that it referred to abortion and same - sex marriage not as rights but " divisive social and political controversies . "   critics such as sen. bob_menendez , the ranking_member of the senate_foreign_relations_committee , said the report would damage the united_states ' reputation as a champion of human_rights around the world by narrowing the scope of who deserves protection .   " as feared , secretary_pompeo used his speech to insinuate a hierarchy of rights where property_rights and religious_liberty are ' foremost ' rights and some rights are not ' worth defending , " ' said the new_jersey democrat .   critics also faulted the makeup of the commission , saying it was weighted with conservatives , and the public did_not_have_sufficient opportunity to weigh in on its findings before the report 's release .   " as was clear from the start , secretary_pompeo 's commission on Unalienable rights was designed to challenge the international consensus with a narrow view of

inside tony Haile 's expedition to ( help ) save the news business ' they wanted to unload it bad ' : why huffpost made sense for buzzfeed   and verizon media group   inside tony Haile 's expedition to ( help ) save the news business   tony Haile is one of the most well - liked personalities in media , a smooth - talking brit who can gossip with reporters , dazzle executives with stories of polar exploration and preach effortlessly about a better , advertising - free internet , all the while sprinkling in references to literature and history .   for over a decade , Haile led Chartbeat , the newsroom analytics tool that became the pulse of media companies imitating silicon_valley . Haile encapsulates both new media and old ( he is married to a scion of the Rodale media dynasty ) . Haile is , simply_put , one of the most charming and well - connected people in the business , the rare executive conversant in the boardroom and on media twitter .   which is why Haile 's contemporaries have been mostly forgiving about scroll , the ad - free subscription service he teased for   before finally launching widely six_months_ago .   for now , scroll has produced barely any revenue for its partners , a slow uptake that has made some media executives question how much to promote it on their sites . some executives say it 's still early . they are rooting for Haile to succeed   and bring them more revenue . but for the time being , Haile 's grand promise of creating a better internet for publishers remains undelivered .   scroll 's reason for existing has_always_been fairly easy to articulate . online advertising is by and large terrible . the race to the bottom has created sites that are cluttered and slow , with struggling local_news_outlets particularly unreadable . facebook_and_google , who have swallowed up the online ad market , offer little more_than blood_money in the form of journalism grants to stave_off regulators and win some good press . turning to subscriptions , publishers have learned that just a tiny percentage of their audience converts . they 've long searched for another savior .   . for $ 5 a month , the service offers subscribers a speedy , ad - free reading experience across more_than_300 media properties and then splits up the revenue to publishers according to how much time readers spent on their site . in january , when scroll launched widely after years of anticipation , participating publishers   . it would take potentially millions of subscribers for scroll to truly impact their bottom lines , but there was reason to give it a try . a partnership with Mozilla 's

when will bollywood_films return to china ? when will bollywood_films return to china ?   by ai pang source : global_times_published : 2020/7/22 13:59:13   a remake of 2015 indian thriller   is leading the box_office in china , as the world 's second - largest film market struggles to recover from being hit_hard_by the covid-19 epidemic . the chinese remake   has earned more_than_3_million yuan ( $ 430,095 ) since chinese_mainland theaters reopened_on_monday , despite competition from hollywood hits such as coco and china 's wolf_warrior 2 .   this makes me wonder when bollywood_films will return to the chinese_mainland market and what the first film will be . according to a previous report in april from indian media , hrithik_roshan 's super 30 is likely to " be the first bollywood_film to release in china after the coronavirus_pandemic . "   however , this will most likely not take_place before september , not because of the political tensions caused by the recent_border_clash in the galwan_valley between china and india , but due to the need to slowly reopen_in_phases .   sources close to chinese movie chains have revealed that due to strict safety_protocols such as health checks , a ban on food or drink and limiting films to no more_than two hours , cinemas are only screening older films such as 2017 's wolf_warrior 2 during the initial_phase , and then will move on to new domestic films that were originally_scheduled to release in the first_half_of_2020 . after a few_months , when things are running_smoothly once_again , new releases like super 30 will finally hit big screens .   some of my indian friends told_me that they were kind of worried that bollywood_films were going to be boycotted in china due to the border_clash in galwan_valley . however , looking at china 's twitter - like sina_weibo and other major media_outlets , this worry seems to be an_overreaction as there are no such voices on sina_weibo calling for a bollywood boycott .   china and chinese people have long been open to cultural_exchanges with india in the form of things like bollywood_movies and music . both countries face similar social issues such as education equality and the gap_between the rich_and_poor - issues that have been well portrayed in bollywood_films . this is why chinese people love to watch indian movies and are open to accepting the ideas behind them and adapting them into our own films just like   yet things are quite different in the eyes of some extreme indian nationalists and media , who have launched a social_media campaign_aimed at bollywood_stars like aamir_khan , salman_khan and shahrukh_khan , who are well - received and welcomed in china . it is making things even worse by following the bad example of the indian government 's ban on

why does uk follow crazy us policy while eu stays sane ? why does uk follow crazy us policy while eu stays sane ?   will london and brussels go separate ways in their china policies after   ? signs have been emerging since the uk began closely following us ' footsteps . by contrast , certain eu members are maintaining cooperative attitudes_toward huawei as_well_as china .   the argument that the uk 's post - brexit china policy will completely veer off that of the eu is bit exaggerated . yet there will surely be differences .   uk 's foreign_policy was once constrained by the eu , but britain also got support from the bloc so that it could maintain a degree of strategic independence from the us .   however , once london officially divorces from brussels , it will lose the backup strength . in this context , especially when the us is changing its china strategy while increasing_pressure on its allies over related_issues , the uk will_inevitably get close to the us .   but brussels will not take washington 's side in a clear - cut way . in the end , eu members will prioritize their_own national_interests .   be issues regarding the iranian nuclear_deal ,   on climate_change , the german - russian nord stream 2 gas_pipeline_project , huawei 's 5_g_technology , or us - europe trade war , washington has seldom taken_into_account the interests of its allies .   the " alliance " is a concept which is used when they jointly face the outside world . taking a look at the inside on the alliance , disputes over different national_interests are easy to spot .   take huawei 's 5g. washington showed little tolerance toward its_european_allies over their collaboration with huawei . yet it has never provided an alternative .   what 's uncle_sam 's plan ? making europe suffer the losses along with the us ? there_is_no way the eu wo_n't be anxious in the current predicament - especially in an era of rapid development of digital_technologies . us pressure is hurting europe 's interests .   so the us tactic is trying to divide the continent and win over more of europe 's support , one country at a time . during us_secretary_of_state_mike_pompeo 's latest trip to the uk , he visited anti - china , pro - us lawmakers from the conservative_party on tuesday before meeting prime_minister_boris_johnson . what an obvious move to exert_pressure on the uk 's government .   however , when most western mainstream_media outlets were busy covering how pompeo was forging a coalition in europe against china , they failed to intentionally or unintentionally touch upon the agreement_reached on monday between brussels and beijing regarding geographical_indications ( gis ) ,

hong_kong galvanizing western alliance versus china china 's move to tighten_control over hong_kong in violation of previous pledges to honor the de_facto city - state 's autonomy could galvanize western_allies to cooperate against beijing .

make the right call on ' malabar ' going quad make the right call on ' malabar ' going quad   india 's plan for naval coalition building alone will not credibly deter china 's military power in the indian_ocean   there is speculation in the media that new_delhi could soon invite_australia to join the malabar naval_exercises to be held later this year . according to reports , the most recent being sunday ( page 1 ,   , july 19 , 2020 ) , a key meeting on friday of india 's ministry of defence discussed the   issue of adding australia to the trilateral malabar_naval_exercise   with japan and the united_states in the bay_of_bengal later this year . while no decision was reached , it appears a green_signal to australia could soon be given , making it the first_time_since 2007 that all members of quad will participate in a joint military_drill ,   beijing has long opposed a coalition of democracies in the indo - pacific_region . the chinese leadership sees the maritime quadrilateral as an asian - nato that seeks only to contain china 's rise . earlier last_week , an_opinion_piece in   , the chinese_communist_party 's mouthpiece , noted that at a time of strained bilateral_ties with china , india 's intention to involve australia in the malabar drill could only be_construed_as a move directed against beijing . by " putting more pressure on china " and moving to expand its " sphere_of_influence into the entire indian_ocean and the south_pacific " , india , the article (   strategic_intent behind new_delhi 's plan to invite_australia to join malabar drill   ) suggested , was risking harsh consequences .   expectedly , indian commentators welcomed the development , hailing it as a long_overdue move . following the stand - off in ladakh , many indian analysts_believe the time is right for india to shed its traditional defensiveness in the maritime_domain . the realists advocate an alliance with the u.s. , japan_and_australia to counter chinese moves in the indian_ocean .   yet , indian decision - makers have reason to be cautious . at_a_time_when india and china are negotiating a truce on the border in eastern_ladakh , new_delhi 's invitation to australia to participate in the malabar exercise sends contrary signals to beijing . if china responded churlishly   as is its wo_nt   through aggressive_posturing in the eastern indian_ocean , it could needlessly open up a new front in the india - china conflict .   the prospect of modest_gains   indian decision - makers should also reflect on the strategic rationale of the military - quad . unlike the u.s. and its pacific partners , whose principal motivation in forming a maritime coalition is to implement a ' rules - based

amid surge in spying cases , u.s. orders china to close houston consulate u.s. closes chinese_consulate in houston ami ...   it 's the latest escalation in an increasingly tense bilateral_relationship .   u.s. president_donald_trump takes part in a welcoming ceremony with china 's president_xi_jinping during a visit to beijing on nov. 9 , 2017 .   the trump_administration ordered the closure of the chinese_consulate in houston by friday , a significant diplomatic escalation between the two rival powers . u.s. officials who spoke to   indicated that the consulate closure is a response to a surge in chinese espionage in the united_states .   washington directed the closure of the consulate " to protect american intellectual_property and americans ' private information , " state_department_spokesperson morgan_ortagus said on wednesday . ortagus did_not cite a specific incident that prompted the move , but she raised accusations that china violated u.s. sovereignty . the closure was announced after a sweeping   was unsealed in federal court in washington state outlining years of chinese state - directed hacking and theft of intellectual_property affecting victims across the united_states and in other countries .   " the united_states will_not_tolerate the prc 's violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people , just as we have not tolerated the prc 's unfair trade practices , theft of american jobs , and other egregious behavior . president_trump insists on fairness and reciprocity in u.s.-china relations , " ortagus said , referring to the people 's_republic_of_china .   chinese officials have vowed retaliation , raising the likelihood that a u.s. consulate in china will be forced closed in response . " the u.s. has far more diplomatic_missions and staff working in china . so if the u.s. is bent on going down this wrong_path , we will resolutely respond , " wang_wenbin , a foreign_ministry_spokesman , said to reporters on wednesday .   reports_suggest that the u.s. consulate   could be closed in retaliation .   how china chooses to retaliate could determine_whether the situation spirals , said larry pfeiffer , who served as cia chief of staff under former_cia director_michael hayden . " if they want to keep it from escalating then picking a place like wuhan would n't be a bad one , " said pfeiffer , noting that u.s. diplomats were already evacuated from the consulate earlier_this_year during the coronavirus_outbreak . " if they closed our hong_kong or shanghai consulate , that would be seen as an escalation , " he said .   u.s. officials have maintained that china , like   other rival powers and the united_states itself   , uses its embassies_and_consulates for spying under_the_guise of routine diplomatic work .

"   " we have watched this epidemic marching right up the east_coast , " rubin says . " it 's not just florida . it 's not just south_carolina . it 's not just north_carolina . but the beach areas of virginia and Rehoboth beach in delaware . "   over the last_two_weeks , he notes , " the highest infection_rate of case growths we 've_seen in a major city in this country have been in baltimore . "   and , he adds , " we_are_now_seeing a clear resurgence in the philadelphia area and [ surrounding ]   counties . we 're starting to see upticks in the shore regions of new_jersey . and we 're actually seeing some elevated [ transmission_rates ] every week in the new_york_city boroughs . "   new england is also at risk : " [ transmission_rates in ] new haven [ in connecticut ] are clearly increasing . the state of rhode_island broadly has increasing transmission . and in the boston area , we 're_seeing the same patterns we saw a couple_of_weeks_ago in philadelphia . we even now have an outbreak on cape cod . and we 're_seeing [ more of the virus ] in new_hampshire . "   the eastern seaboard is n't rubin 's only concern . he 's " extremely_worried " about a number of northern and midwestern cities such as indianapolis , detroit and milwaukee that " no one is talking_about now but [ for which ] our models very clearly are detecting elevated_risk for the next_few_weeks , not just in the cities but in their suburban counties .

china has more important things to do than engage in a power rivalry with the us china has more important things to do than engage in a power rivalry with the us   by wen sheng source : global_times_published : 2020/7/26 16:38:18   as the us presidential_election_in_november draws near , the incumbent trump government has opted to exacerbate economic , diplomatic and political attacks on china - to deflect the administration 's disastrously failing response to the covid-19 pandemic which has claimed more_than_140,000 american lives and sent its economy into free_fall .   to stoke up animosity toward china and lure american hardcore rightist voters to support trump 's reelection bid , the white_house moved to undermine the two countries ' diplomatic_relations by ordering china 's consulate_in_houston , texas , to be shut_down . in a tit - for - tat move , beijing then closed the us ' consulate_in_chengdu , sichuan .   determined to find a scapegoat for almost every woe in the country , the current us government will , undoubtedly , continue assaulting and stigmatizing china in the coming three_months prior to the casting of votes at the ballots on november 3 .   correspondingly , chinese people and the policy - makers in beijing should keep sober and calm , and be well prepared for the worst provocations from washington .   from launching the relentless trade war against china in late 2018 , to pursuing technology " decoupling " by blacklisting huawei , zte and dozens of chinese tech_startups , to the present diplomatic skirmish , the current us government could become even more erratic and do even more crazy things -- for its sole_purpose of staying another 4 years in the white_house .   quite_a_few geopolitical world affairs analysts see the rivalry_between the us and china as becoming a paradigm of international_relations . however , this perception is only partially correct . china 's leadership , focusing on building a shared_future for humankind , does_not_believe in a bi - polar domination of world order .   chinese people believe that , in addition to the us and china , other major_economies and powers like the eu and russia , as_well_as japan , brazil and the uk , should all play prominent roles in contributing to global_governance .   unlike the us government , china has trust in fair , transparent and non - discriminative principles for business competition . chinese manufactured household appliances are welcomed by customers in other countries because they are high_quality and inexpensive . we like to buy german and japanese - made cars , french - made bags and wines , south_korean - made cosmetics , because they are , too , of high_quality .   chinese people are loath to see the trump_administration make up unsubstantiated_claims to slander
Kahlil robert Irving 's gritty ceramics and internet collages examine contemporary violence Kahlil robert Irving 's gritty ceramics and internet collages examine contemporary violence   music memorial in film [ ( greeting screening chained ) daily ritual & tribute ( terror ) ]   portrait of Kahlil robert Irving by Attilio d'Agostino . courtesy_of_the_artist .   has built an extensive multimedia series called " street views . " it spans monotype prints of caution fences to collages of images from the internet to reimagined american_flags . Irving 's best - known works in the series are his ceramic sculptures , which feature decals , protuberances that recall takeout containers and empty plastic_bottles , and bits of newspaper . " ' street views ' is broad in the material investigative sense , but also quite specific and some of the things that i have been able_to_accomplish and construct so_far , " Irving said . if he demonstrates an omnivorous attitude_towards materials , his singular approach to artmaking prevails throughout the series : Irving 's practice explores political issues and asks questions_about contemporary life in a way that 's impactful without striving for a specific outcome .   the st. Louisbased artist explained that he is n't so much creatively inspired as he is attuned to the world around him and his own shifting interior landscape . " i_think our lives tell us a lot of different things , " he said , " and we can choose to listen to them and engage in them , or we continue_to_ignore them like the white_supremacist society in which we live has_taught_us to do . " Irving has chosen the former approach . his multimedia work is n't meant to be performative , but to offer possibilities for change .   Irving has_come_a_long_way since he began experimenting_with pottery at the age of 12 . in recent_years , the kansas_city art institute alumnus has participated in solo and group exhibitions around the country . most recently , he created work for a solo_show at   mixed_messages ( streets & screens ) AOL + lottery   , " which was postponed_due to covid-19 . new_york 's Callicoon fine_arts has mounted two solo presentations of his work , and the cincinnati contemporary_art center recently commissioned him to make an installation for their lobby .   whitney_museum of american art   is exhibiting Irving 's ceramic sculpture   ( 2018 ) in its much - lauded show " making knowing : craft in art 19502019 . " the abstract piece comprises glazed and unglazed stoneware and porcelain ; opal , silver , and blue luster ; and decals . in one corner , Irving placed a newport cigarette box logo upside_down to look like the nike swoosh , while a newsprinted , gourd - like form juts from

a rush to use black art leaves the artists feeling used black creative professionals say they have been used to lend legitimacy to diversity campaigns while being underpaid and pigeonholed .   Shantell martin was among artists asked to create a black_lives_matter mural for microsoft quickly , while the protests after george_floyd 's killing were " still relevant . "   Demetrius freeman for the new_york_times   the streets of new_york were crowded with protesters when Shantell martin received_an_email from an ad agency last_month .   m : united , a firm owned by the global advertising company mccann , wanted to know if ms. martin , a black artist , would be interested in creating a mural about the black_lives_matter_movement on microsoft 's boarded - up fifth avenue storefront . and could she do it , the email said , " while the protests are still relevant and the boards are still up , ideally no later than this coming sunday ? "   several other black_artists received the same email . in   to microsoft and mccann , ms. martin and the other artists described the invitation as " both shocking and somehow predictable . " they also wrote that it " betrays a telling and dangerous opportunism . "   " in their rush to portray a public solidarity with the black_lives_matter_movement , companies risk reinscribing what got us all here : the instrumentalization and exploitation of black labor , ideas and talent for what is ultimately their_own benefit and safety , " the group wrote .   the efforts of major companies to   the protests_against_racism_and_police brutality have rung hollow for some black workers in creative fields .   artists , models , designers , copywriters and others said they had been drafted to lend legitimacy to companies that fail to live up to principles of diversity_and_inclusion . they said they had been   pigeonholed for roles in ad_campaigns   or penalized when they raised_objections about efforts they felt were insensitive , and had been underpaid , or not given proper credit for their work .   on june_6 about the mural request , several mccann employees told her that the ad agency had reached out to her and other artists despite some internal objections about how the project was being handled , she said in an_interview . both   , the chief_marketing_officer of microsoft , and   , the chief_executive of mccann , apologized publicly to ms. martin on twitter .   the language used in the email to ms. martin " was flat out wrong , " mr. diamond wrote . microsoft said in a statement that the message was " an unacceptable mistake " and that the company took " full accountability .

after pakistan , iran brings home the chinese_dragon aerial_view of the chabahar_port , iran .   some indian and iranian antiquarians might nostalgically speak about the commonality of their ethnocultural origin but in practical dealings , these long - forgotten and outdated pleasantries hardly play any meaningful role . yes , for a very short_duration of the pan - iranian movement spearheaded_by the founder of Pahlavi ruling house , reza shah Pahlavi , iranian academics and pragmatic scholars did conduct valuable researches in the phenomenon . however , indians seem to have given only lip_service to it .   a partial freeze in india - iran relations set in as early as 1979 , when , in the aftermath of the ouster of monarchy , Teheran passed into the hands of orthodox ecclesiastical fraternity . the Ayatollahs , reminiscent of the zoroastrian   ( clerical ) hierarchical structure no_doubt a significant social entity had , hitherto , remained apolitical , or at the best , played a minimal advisory role if and when domestic exigency so demanded . the difference is that following the islamic_revolution , the iranian clergy cleverly sidelined the iranian left , the real vanguard of the revolutionary_movement , and directly grabbed political power . it ruthlessly attuned the entire iranian polity to its time - hardened pro - islamic stereotype . keeping clear of religious tag , indian political arrangement only sullenly watched the history of the region shaping quite differently .   with the introduction of the rule of the iranian islamic_republic in 1979 , indo - iranian trajectory of relations shifted from benign intimacy to disgusting caution . india strictly_followed the international norm of non - interference_in_the_internal_affairs of a state . under the guidance of imam khomeini , the hero of the islamic_revolution , the Ayatollahs set_forth an_effective_mechanism for a quick shift from pan - iran - ism to pan - islamism . a large_number of pan - iranian fans , staunch nationalists and upholders of iran 's civilizational permanence left their native land and sought_refuge in western_countries , especially the us , to escape persecution . the long_drawn conflict between reason and dogma reappeared in its new avatar .   obviously , in ideological terms , islamic_republic_of_iran was bound to enter a phase of deep skepticism and hostility_towards the arab_world in general and saudi arab monarchy in particular , an institution iran stubbornly refused to recognize as the epicentre of islamism on the globe .   nation that does_not easily untie the accumulated baggage of loathing against   its adversary . the ayatollah 's antagonism against the us is that ( a ) it   supported monarchical rule in iran and suppressed populist movements especially   it offers solid support to the state of israel against palestinians ( c ) it   protects

china focus : new railway laid to quicken xinjiang 's exchanges with qinghai and beyond china focus : new railway laid to quicken xinjiang 's exchanges with qinghai and beyond   by xinhua writers zhang Zhongkai , guan Qiaoqiao and zhang xiaolong   urumqi , july_21 ( xinhua ) -- the laying of railway_tracks for a new line linking northwest_china 's xinjiang_uygur_autonomous_region with qinghai province and beyond was completed tuesday , paving_the_way_for accelerating development in the country 's western region .   the 1,213.7 - km Golmud - Korla railway , linking the city of Golmud in qinghai and the city of Korla in xinjiang , is the third railway for exchanges_between xinjiang and other regions .   the railway crosses a variety of landscapes including deserts , plateaus and mountains as_well_as natural reserves , and boasts an altitude difference of up to 2,500 meters , according to china railway first group co. , ltd. ( CRFG ) , the railway 's developer .   a string of steps such as building railway bridges have been taken to minimize_the_impact on the local environment and wildlife , the company said .   Taitema lake in southeast xinjiang 's Ruoqiang county is one of the ecologically sensitive_areas that the railway crosses . the longest railway_bridge in xinjiang , about 25 km_long , is built to cross the lake where reeds and birds abound . its piers are made of environmentally_friendly materials and leave enough space for wild_animals to pass through .   the construction of the railway is divided_into_two sections , with the length of the xinjiang section topping 708 km . it took about three years to finish laying railway_tracks for the section .   " it 's an arduous project as railway workers had to overcome sandstorms , cold_weather , lack_of_oxygen and other tough natural conditions , " said huang Kejun , a CRFG official who oversees the track - laying .   with a tunnel of over 13 km , the railway is the first to cross the Altun mountains , a no - man's - land in southeast xinjiang . " this is the most challenging part of the whole xinjiang section , " huang said , citing the harsh working environment and complex geological structures .   the line , which is slated to be put_into_operation later this year , will cut the travel time between Golmud and Korla from about 26 hours to roughly 12 hours .   a railroad switch was made in april at Golmud station to connect the qinghai - tibet railway with the Golmud - Korla railway . the railway connection will thread qinghai 's provincial_capital of Xining , Korla in central xinjiang and lhasa , capital of tibet_autonomous_region .   the operation of the Golmud - Korla railway will

uk firms licensed to sell spy tech to repressive_regimes uk firms are selling invasive spy tech to repressive governments_around_the_world   pakistan 's prime_minister , imran_khan , said in april that the country was using a system intended to surveil terrorists to monitor the coronavirus .   uk companies are marketing and selling spy tech to countries accused of using such technology to abuse human_rights .   official 2020 data analysed by business_insider showed firms were licensed to sell surveillance kit to pakistan , oman , and the uae , among other nations .   activists criticized the sale of such technologies to countries with questionable records on democracy_and_human_rights .   uk companies are selling and marketing spy tech to countries accused of using these kinds of technology to violate_human_rights ,   according to export license data analysed by business_insider   such interception equipment can monitor and intercept mobile_phones in a given area .   the most common type is an IMSI catcher , essentially a fake mobile_phone tower that logs the IMSI number , or international mobile subscriber identity , of every phone that connects to it .   this can reveal the owner of the device and allows for more advanced snooping on communications .   during the first_three_months_of_2020 , undisclosed british_firms were granted licenses to export such tools to pakistan , indonesia , india , oman , the uae , and south_africa .   many of the licenses_issued were temporary , allowing british companies to promote their products at international trade fairs , although these often become permanent once a formal deal with a client has been agreed .   since interception technology is a " dual - use " technology , or one that can_be_used for both military_and_civilian purposes , uk businesses must acquire a license from the department for international trade to sell these tools abroad .   like other dual - use products , exports of interception equipment are controlled due to " concerns about internal repression , regional_instability or other human_rights_violations , " according to   however , the government 's own disclosures cast_doubt over the extent to which authorities have prevented exports on these grounds .   export license data covering the first_three_months_of_2020 reveals that an unnamed british company was granted the right to export interception equipment to pakistan during a time in which authorities have   dramatically_increased their surveillance_capabilities   on citizens in response to covid-19 . this has included using advanced_technology normally reserved for counter - terrorism operations .

china queries fuel fears of ban on hong_kong democrat candidates at_least_a_dozen opposition candidate hopefuls receive letters   activist asked about recent_visit to meet u.s. officials   hong_kong 's decision to query opposition candidates about ties with foreign governments suggests authorities could be preparing to use new national_security_legislation to disqualify pro - democracy advocates ahead of a key fall election .   at_least seven potential pro - democracy candidates for hong_kong 's legislative_council elections have received questionnaires from the government asking them to show they have n't violated the city 's mini constitution , known as the basic_law , or the recently imposed security measures .   the move fueled concerns within the pro - democracy movement that hong_kong officials might use provisions of the security law -- which bars subversion , secession , terrorism and foreign collusion -- to question , undermine or disqualify opposition candidates who have previously criticized the local_administration and the government in beijing .   the election , set for early september , comes after unprecedented anti - government protests last_year . it follows local district council elections in november in which the opposition won 85 % of the seats , momentum it hopes to ride to a majority in the legislature .   if hong_kong were to use the controversial_national_security_law to disqualify candidates , it would likely prompt fierce criticism from the u.s. , which has already blasted beijing for imposing the legislation -- and moved to end the special trading privileges that help distinguish hong_kong from the mainland -- amid broader tensions_with_china .   " these letters are paving_the_way to disqualification , but sometimes there 's still some room to maneuver , " said ivan Choy , a senior politics lecturer at the chinese_university_of_hong_kong . still , he added , " the overall situation is much_worse with the national_security_law , after the landslide_victory of the democrats in the district council elections , and because of the bad relationship_between the u.s. and china . "   at_least 12 opposition figures have received letters of inquiry from their_respective electoral officers , according to the hong_kong economic journal and cable_tv . they include prominent activist joshua_wong , Alvin yeung and cheng tat - hung of the civic party , and kenneth leung , who plans to represent the accountancy sector .   yeung was asked to explain his recent_visit to the u.s. -- where he met american officials and called for sanctions against certain hong_kong officials -- and if he will continue lobbying foreign governments , according to the letter seen by bloomberg . it cited yeung 's social_media_posts and media interviews .

" in the long_term , i believe we have a quick trade_deal which has some of the pending matters built up over the last_couple_of_years , which we need to get out of the way quickly . we are almost there , " goyal said at the u.s.-india business council 's india ideas summit , being conducted virtually .   both new_delhi and washington should also look at a preferential_trade pact with 50 to 100 products and move to a free_trade pact in the long_term , goyal said . (   we noted in october_2019   : in the bigger_picture within the trade team , commerce secretary wilbur_ross was positioned with primary_responsibility toward the eu and india . ross clear - cuts through the politics , explains trump 's objectives amid the trade proposals , and paves a path for u.s. trade rep bob lighthizer to engage his counterparts .   india has_always_been a key strategic nation within the global trade - realignment taking_place by the trump_administration . underpinning the geopolitics , the " indo - pacific " strategy is structurally the decoupling of the u.s. from china .   as a part of the strategy president_trump positioned the asean ( association_of_southeast_asian_nations ) as benefactors in manufacturing & trade as an outcome of the u.s. decoupling from china .   however , india had genuine_concerns about the global dynamic . specifically , india is worried_about allowing the multinationals to have influence over their economy and social structure . in_this_regard india was not wrong ; their concerns were not unfounded .   we can all see , heck we 've_lived through , massive multinational_corporations quickly gaining too_much influence ; including -eventually- corporate influence over the politics of a nation . that corporatism inherently leads to corruption .   when americans see it in other nations we call it " bribery and corruption " , but when it happens in washington , dc , we call it " lobbying " ; the process is exactly the same .   as a consequence of the concern , indian_prime_minister_modi was straddling the fence while president_trump tried to influence him to come over to the side of ' free markets ' .

the consequences of belt_and_road_initiative in nepal border and trans - boundary water politics   china 's belt_and_road_initiative   global_governance , sustainable_development and smart_cities   NIICE experts in the media   the consequences of belt_and_road_initiative in nepal   25 july 2020 , NIICE commentary   the ' chinese dream ' project is now upgraded to the belt_and_road_initiative ( bri ) . the belt_and_road_initiative ( bri ) is a worldwide project initiated and funded by china starting from 2013 , and it majorly incorporates five aspects : impeded trade , financial integrity , policy coordination , connectivity and people - to - people relations . it was basically aimed_at integrating the larger parts of the world , i.e. asia , europe and africa . the context for china to create bri is both_domestic_and_international . the domestic reason for china is the balanced development of the whole country , particularly the western part of china . for this , china raised_the_slogan " go west " . the international reason for china is its desperate desire for changing the us - centric world order into a multipolar_world order wherein china could emerge as a leading power .   bri has three layers of planning : the initial_phase was planned for 2013 to 2020 , the second_phase is from 2020 to 2035 and the last phase is 2035 to 2050 . along with the implementation of the bri , the chinese economy is also stratified for three_phases of economic_development : the first period is for rapid economic_growth , the second_phase is structural adjustment period and the third phase is rethinking on the policies that need reform .   by 2020 , it was expected that china would achieve a relatively comfortable life for the complete chinese society . it would be a historical achievement . by 2035 , china envisioned establishing a modern socialist country that would have decisive power with increased economic leadership , scientific_and_technological power , security strength , and cultural soft_power . by_2050 , china planned the establishment of a prosperous democratic civilisation based on modern socialism .   before the dawn of 2020 , china was hit heavily by the covid-19 pandemic , originating in december_2019 . during this ongoing_pandemic , china received a positive appraisal from some parts of the world and some countries have described china with a very negative image . during this healthcare crisis , china fought fiercely with the virus . many doctors , researchers , and nurses had greatly contributed to fight_against the virus . now the whole_world_is_fighting against it . china had also instantly planned the ' health_silk_road ' for the pandemic . whatever circumstances have emerged , china has managed to cope_with such circumstances , either in favourable or adverse situations . however , worse circumstances have come up in the implementation of bri
why tiktok 's ties to china pose a significant privacy and security risk tiktok and the privacy perils of china 's first international social_media_platform   tiktok , the video - sharing platform owned by the chinese social_media_giant bytedance , is one of the most_popular social_media services in the world , with an estimated 800_million users . however , its zealous data_collection , use of chinese infrastructure , and its parent_company 's close_ties to the chinese_communist_party make it a perfect tool for massive surveillance and data_collection by the chinese government .   after reviewing tiktok 's data_collection policies , lawsuits , cybersecurity white_papers , past security vulnerabilities , and its privacy_policy ,   we find tiktok to be a grave privacy threat that likely shares data with the chinese government .   we recommend everyone approach tiktok with great caution , especially if your threat model includes the questionable use of your personal_data or chinese government surveillance .   how much user_data does tiktok collect ?   as with just about every social_media_platform , the answer is : " a lot . " according to its   , even if you just download and open the app but never create an account , tiktok will collect your :   browsing history ( i.e. , the content you viewed on tiktok )   location_data if you are using a mobile_device ( including gps coordinates and wifi and mobile cell data )   info on the device you used to access tiktok ( for android devices , this includes your imei_number , which is essentially your device 's fingerprint so it can be identified , and potentially your IMSI number , which is used to track users from one phone to another )   to open an account , you must enter a phone_number or email and your date_of_birth . once you have created an account , tiktok asks your permission for access to your social_media_accounts ( like twitter , instagram , facebook , etc . ) , your phone 's contact list , and gps data .   once you start using the app , tiktok logs details about :   how long you watch videos   any messages you exchange in the app   finally , if you buy coins , the in - app currency you can use to support your_favorite video creators , tiktok will store your payment information .   according to tiktok , if you delete your account , the company will delete your account data , videos , and information within_30_days . this claim is impossible to independently_verify , as is the case with most social_media_companies .   tiktok 's data_collection is extreme , even for a social_media_platform that collects its users ' data to serve them with targeted
yes , fake_news is a problem . but there 's a real news problem , too . when you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site , we earn an affiliate commission .   what do you call it when a hedge_fund buys a local_newspaper and squeezes it for revenue , laying_off editors and reporters and selling off the paper 's downtown headquarters for conversion into   the devastation has become common enough that some observers have resorted to shorthand for what collectively amounts to an extinction - level event . one former editor calls it a " harvesting strategy " ; margaret sullivan , in her new book , " Ghosting the news , " calls it " strip - mining . " like the climate emergency that sullivan mentions by way of comparison , the decimation of local news yields two phenomena that happen to feed off each_other : the far - reaching_effects are cataclysmic , and it 's hard to convince a significant_number of people that they ought to care .   " disinformation " and " fake_news " bring to mind scheming operatives , russian troll farms and noisy propaganda ; stories about them are titillating enough to garner plenty of attention . but what sullivan writes about is a " real - news problem "   the shuttering of more_than_2,000 american newspapers since_2004 , and the creation of " news deserts , " or entire counties with no local_news_outlets at all .   she begins her book with the example of a 2019 story from the buffalo news about a suburban police chief who received an unexplained $_100,000 payout when he abruptly retired . the article did_n't win any awards or even appear on the front_page , sullivan writes . " it merely was the kind of day - in - and - day - out local reporting that makes secretive town officials unhappy . "   " merely " and " day - in - and - day - out " ; sullivan also describes the article as " routine - enough fare . " " Ghosting the news " is a brisk and pointed tribute to painstaking , ordinary and valuable work . as the media columnist for the washington_post and the former public editor for the new_york_times , sullivan has spent most of the past_decade writing for a national audience , but for 32 years before that she worked at the buffalo news , starting as a summer intern and eventually becoming the newspaper 's editor .   margaret sullivan , author of " Ghosting the news . "   sullivan recalls the flush days when the paper boasted a newsroom fully staffed by journalists who could combine their calling with a career . then came the internet , which siphoned_off attention and
xi_jinping plans to control pakistans politics , economy via cpec_authority : report according to an article by ali_salman Andani published in the asia times , khan , a puppet of the military_establishment , was able to manipulate the law to fulfil xi Jinpings desires to control the planning ministry of pakistan .   pakistani prime_minister_imran_khan arrives to attend a welcoming banquet for the belt_and_road_forum hosted by chinese_president_xi_jinping and his_wife peng_liyuan at the great_hall_of_the_people in beijing , china on april_26 , 2019 .   since 2016 , president_xi_jinping has pushed for china - pakistan economic_corridor ( cpec ) and a cpec_authority that would bring the countrys infrastructure and power - generation projects under his direct control .   according to an article by ali_salman Andani published in the asia times , khan , a puppet of the military_establishment , was able to manipulate the law to fulfil Xis desires to control the planning ministry of pakistan .   i consider pakistans ministry of planning , development_and_special_initiatives as one of the most crucial state_institutions , whose senior_bureaucrats could implicitly scrutinise and resist Xis draconian cpec scheme , as they had access to all of the secret_documents on the agreement and were involved , directly_and_indirectly , in the decision - making process , Andani opined .   so long as the reins were under the control of civilian institutions led by representatives of the people and civil_servants , thorough accountability of Xis master_plan at_least at some level and at some point in time - if not at once - was possible . sidelining the civil institutions altogether would allow xi to play on both_sides of the board , he said .   Andani said , xi does_nt want the belt_and_road_initiative or any of its components to be_held_accountable or face resistance . he knows that his chinese dream of indoctrination of a majority of free people of the world by_2050 will not be fulfilled if the people of the countries victimised by the bri come to know about his strategy to destroy their futures and those of their future_generations .   he said that the cpec_authority will be the communist_party of chinas ( CPCs ) authorised_representative in pakistan responsible for conceiving , implementing , expanding , enforcing , controlling , regulating , coordinating , monitoring , evaluating and carrying_out all activities related to the cpec .   the cpec_authority will also the constitutional power to initiate any investigation or even impose penalties against any public_office_holder , including the prime_minister and president of pakistan , or those directly_or_indirectly involved in cpec - related_activities wilfully resisting directions , instructions or specified orders , Andani said while adding , even the prime_ministers powers will be limited to what is specified in the cpec_authority bill 2020 . so he too will have to obey Xis commands .   the

huawei - funded think_tank takes_aim_at top china hawk huawei - funded think_tank takes_aim_at top china hawk   peterson institute for international economics works with regime officials to rebut china criticism   a prominent u.s. think_tank that received hundreds_of_thousands_of_dollars from huawei has repeatedly given senior chinese officials a megaphone to rail against the trump_administration and promote pro - china talking_points .   the peterson institute for international economics hosted chinese world_trade_organization ambassador zhang Xiangchen , who used the high - profile venue to denounce protectionists as " headless chickens " in a thinly_veiled criticism of trade skeptics in the united_states . PIIE promoted the july_15 event on social_media by taking direct aim at sen. josh_hawley ( r. , mo.)a prominent china hawk who spearheaded the push to withdraw the united_states from the wto .   PIIE has benefited_from its ties with the chinese elite ,   nearly $_400,000 between_2010_and_2018 from huawei , a chinese_tech_giant indicted by the federal_government , according to PIIE president adam Posen . the think_tank has also   hundreds_of_thousands_of_dollars from an anti - democratic hong_kong billionaire and a nonprofit widely_considered a front group for the chinese government 's influence - peddling operations .   groups and individuals linked to the regime have poured millions_of_dollars into washington , d.c. , in an effort to shape policy . hawley said PIIE 's partnership is just another example of the chinese_communist_party ( ccp ) finding a receptive audience among the american elite , whether it be in d.c. think_tanks or corporate boardrooms .   " that the chinese government and its party propagandists should_be_given a platform to extend their influence in the u.s. is disappointing , to say the least , " hawley told the   n that the think_tank " essentially fired [ huawei ] as a donor " in 2018 when the extent of its national_security_threat became public knowledge . he also said that huawei 's donations did_not have ties to any specific research done at the think_tank . the institute 's spokesperson added that PIIE regularly hosts government officials from a variety of countries , including china , to " encourage an open exchange_of_views . "   PIIE has cultivated close_ties with chinese elites , inviting senior_officials to speak at its annual symposia cohosted with the china finance 40 forum ( CF40)a state - backed think_tank headed_by   officials . the symposium has functioned as a highly_visible platform for senior_officials to not only   the trump_administration 's trade policy , but also   the belt_and_road Initiativethe controversial program accused of being a conduit for chinese influence in developing_countries . past panelists have   china 's vice minister of finance and the vice_chairman of the chinese people 's_political_consultative_conference , a political_advisory_body for the regime .

Munk , who has worked for the outlet for 18 years since joining as an intern while still a student , said many journalists were in tears as they left the newsroom for the last time on friday .   index was considered the last major independent outlet in hungary , which is ranked the second worst country in the eu for media freedom by reporters_without_borders . during the past_decade of rule by the far - right prime_minister ,   , the media_landscape has gradually contracted , as numerous outlets were bought out by pro - government figures or closed down .   speaking on a visit to portugal on friday , hungary 's foreign_minister , Pter Szijjrt , said claims that government interference was behind the turmoil at index were " untrue accusations " , while the company 's chief_executive Lszl Bodolai has insisted that there_is_no external_interference in the outlet 's editorial line .

how i came out about my disability [ image description : helen Hoang smiling slightly as she poses in a yard lined with greenery . ] ms. Hoang , a romance novelist , explains how she practiced masking , in which autistic people hide their autistic traits to better fit in with society .   john francis peters for the new_york_times   ms. Hoang is a romance novelist whose works include " the kiss quotient " and " the bride test . "   " what is this word ? " my_mom asked me unexpectedly one day , motioning me toward her bed , where she was reading an article on her ipad . i_did_n't_think much of it at first , but that day , it just so happened that the particular article she was reading was about me , and the word she was n't familiar_with was " autism . "   about a year earlier , at 34 , i 'd learned i had " high functioning " autism spectrum disorder , also_known_as Asperger 's syndrome . and i had n't told her . i had n't really known   to tell her . more_than that , i 'd feared her reaction , so i 'd simply avoided the topic around her altogether .   now , i was forced to say it out_loud for her . " autism . "   " what is it ? " she asked .   " you know how dad is crazy ? " i know " crazy " is a poor word choice , but for better_or_worse , this was how my vietnamese immigrant family described my_dad 's baffling - to - them behavior . while i was growing up , he was unpredictable , often frightening , prone to dramatic public outbursts , and an alcoholic . other times , however , he was brilliant , fun , charismatic and loving . he plays a prominent_role in my worst childhood memories , and the very best ones as well . years after my parents separated , he learned he had Asperger 's syndrome . " i 'm just like him . but i hide it . i 'm autistic . "   i tried_to_explain masking , the process whereby autistic people ( usually women ) hide or mask their autistic traits to better fit in with society . i 'm   good at masking . i learned to do this when i was little because i could see how people reacted to my_dad , but underneath an easygoing , smiley facade , i 've always_struggled with issues like difficulty socializing , a need for routine , interests so consuming that they negatively_impact my life , repetitive habits that i ca_n't_stop , and mental breakdowns .   after coming
xi_jinping ignores floods , urges businessmen to ' rise to challenges ' china : xi_jinping ignores historic floods , urges businessmen to ' rise to challenges '   chinese dictator_xi_jinping delivered comments on tuesday again offering no leadership on the historic floods threatening at_least 27 provinces in the country , instead pressuring chinese businesses to rapidly make up for losses_caused_by the chinese coronavirus_pandemic .   over a month of consistent heavy_rain has resulted in hundreds of rivers in the chinese heartland flooding , particularly the yangtze   the longest river in asia spanning nearly_4,000 miles . the flooding has raised international concern_over the security of the three_gorges_dam , china 's premier infrastructure achievement , now believed_to_have_been " distorted " by water pressure . chinese officials have blown_up at_least one other minor dam to protect three_gorges .   the summary of xi 's remarks tuesday   by state news_agency_xinhua does_not indicate that xi mentioned the floods at all , despite_the_fact_that they are affecting key economic centers in the country like the wuhan metropolitan_area ( the yangtze flows through the heart of wuhan ) . xi instead urged " entrepreneurs " to be more aggressive in competing internationally .   " through joint_efforts of the whole_nation , china has achieved_significant strategic results in epidemic_prevention_and_control , while its economy reported stable performance with signs of improvements , " xi said at the event , identified as a " symposium " on entrepreneurship in the communist country .   " xi called for efforts to boost confidence and rise to challenges , amid endeavors to make up for the losses_caused_by the epidemic and strive for good results in economic_development throughout the year , " xinhua reported . " in the face of an external environment characterized_by rising protectionism , global_economic_downturn , and a shrinking international market , xi_stressed the need to pool resources and concentrate on managing the country 's affairs well . "   xi reportedly did_not list overwhelming natural_disaster as one of the national " affairs " that need managing . he did emphasize the need for china to " speed_up breakthroughs in core technologies , " a concern for american officials given the growing wave of   against chinese citizens and affiliates in america for stealing american intellectual_property .   " we shall stand on the correct side of history , stick to deepening reforms and opening_up , step up opening_up and cooperation in the sci - tech field , advance the development of an open world economy , and promote the building of a community_with_a_shared_future for mankind , " xi reportedly concluded .   , the official newspaper of the communist_party_of_china   in its report on xi 's speech that among those in attendance were representatives of foreign companies like microsoft and Panasonic , listening to xi 's
aip submarines will increase the lethality of the indian_navy i cover the changing world of underwater warfare .   the fuel_cell aip ( air independent power ) system developed by drdo and larsen_&_toubro would   lengthen the hull of the submarine   unlike its potential adversaries china and pakistan , india has yet to adopt air independent power ( aip ) for its submarines . also_known_as air independent   , this technology allows a non - nuclear_submarine to operate for longer without having to surface . this makes_it_harder to detect and allows it to patrol in high - risk areas for longer .   but aip is coming to indian submarines . the current Kalvari class boats are expected to receive an indian - made system . this should greatly increase the potency of india 's non - nuclear_submarines .   indian engineers have been working on an indigenous aip system . engineering_firm larsen_&_toubro has built and   that fits inside the Kalvari 's hull . the company is also involved in india 's indigenous nuclear - powered submarine .   according to people familiar_with the situation , the plan is for each of the Kalvari class_submarines to be retrofitted with the indigenous aip . this should happen six to seven_years after commissioning . it would be mounted in a hull extension that is inserted between the crew area and the engine space . the locally designed system is expected to extend the endurance of the submarines by two_weeks .   india will operate six of the Kalvari class , which are the newest non - nuclear_submarines in the indian fleet . they are a version of the french - designed Scorpne type submarines . in the french lineage these are a generation newer than the agosta class boats in service with neighboring pakistan .   some of pakistan 's Agostas already have aip , which for the moment may confer some advantages to them . unlike the indian subs , which will use fuel_cells , the pakistan navy submarines use the MESMA (   ) system . this burns ethanol with stored oxygen to produce steam , which turns a turbine similar to a nuclear_power_plant .   pakistan is buying eight type 093B submarines from china that will come with another type of aip called a stirling generator , which uses a closed - cycle diesel engine . these are essentially the same as china 's own aip submarines , 17 of which are believed_to_be in service . the stirling generator is famous because of the swedish navy 's use , and it is also the type used by japan .   , author of the sub brief podcast , believes that aip will give the indian_navy strategy advantages over the current non - nuclear_submarines .

Jevlan Shirmemmet lost_contact_with his family_members in the beginning of 2018 , and he has been trying to learn about their whereabouts through different channels ever_since . in february_2020 , he learned that his mom might have been sentenced_to_five_years for possibly " assisting terrorist_activities " through a phone_call with staff at the chinese_consulate in istanbul .   rmemmet is originally from Korgas county in the ili kazakh autonomous_prefecture in china 's xinjiang_autonomous_region . both of his parents are lifelong civil_servants and his_younger_brother also began to work in Korgas county after he graduated_from college .   on_the_other_hand , Shirmemmet has been studying and working in istanbul since 2011 . he works as a tour guide for chinese tour groups visiting istanbul , and every summer and winter break , he would visit family in xinjiang . however , all changed since january_2018 , when he lost_contact_with his family_members .   according to him , the last time he called his parents on wechat was on january 11 , 2018 , and nothing seemed suspicious during that call . his mom told him that she planned to retire from her job in three_months , but two days after that call , she suddenly deleted him from wechat . then , his_younger_brother and other family_members also began to delete him from their wechat .   around_the_same_time , similar things were happening to his other uyghurs friends in turkey , and this led him to believe that their family_members back in xinjiang may have been ordered to cut_off communication with family_members living_abroad . as_a_result , he decided to wait_until his family_members added him back to their wechat .   after a year , he still did_n't reconnect with his family_members on wechat , so he decided to ask friends in xinjiang to look for his missing family_members . in december_2019 , almost two years after he lost_contact_with them , he learned that his parents and younger_brother were sent to the re - education camps_in_xinjiang in january , 2018 . while his father and younger_brother were released in december , 2019 , his mom was sentenced_to_five_years in prison for an unknown crime .   unsuccessful quest to determine his mother 's fate   Shirmemmet said his mom visited turkey in 2013 as part of a government - approved tour group , and she spent some time with him in istanbul . but a

developing more positive perspective change for bri and cpec chinapakistan_economic_corridor ( cpec ) is one of six land_routes under chinese belt_and_road_initiative ( bri ) started in 2013 . ' belt ' refers to six overland routes for road_and_rail transportation , called ' the silk_road_economic_belt ' ; whereas road refers to the sea_routes , or the 21st_century_maritime_silk_road . basically , it is revival of old silk_route which remained functional from 2nd century_bc to 18th_century bc . silk_route was not just a trade_route to export chinese silk , as the name implies , but this was a source of forming an interaction between different civilisations along the route in economic , cultural , political and religious domains . chinese government looks at this initiative of cpec as not only a way for global connectivity to boost_trade and economic_growth , covering asia , europe and africa but also with reference to infrastructure_development and investment in nearly seventy countries , consisting of 65 % of the world 's population . however , united_states_of_america and her allies look at it as a chinese centred trading network and chinese endeavour for global_dominance . whatever the case may be , the fact_remains that this initiative has challenged us supremacy in the current international world order . the belt_and_road_initiative is a very ambitious initiative allowing china to have presence in the involved countries which may not be acceptable to us - led western bloc presently leading the world , so their opposition to bri is natural . on_the_other_hand , at first look , bri appears_to_be a trade_route where chinese_goods will be transported to these countries and beyond . there is a genuine question about what will be coming back to china in return , whether this will be a foreign_exchange from these countries or natural_resources and raw_material for chinese manufacturers or there is something_else of value from these countries . countries which are a part of bri hold the right to ask these questions . moreover , transportation infrastructures to export chinese_goods , are establishing with chinese loans and concern about earnings to payback the loans with interest are genuine . in business , a financially_viable project is one that returns its investment in 6 - 8 years , will that happen in case of chinese projects ? there has to be a clear business plan to earn and pay back the loans pakistan is taking from china . some of these issues are still not very_clear , at_least to the general_public . for any international joint_venture , there is always this fear that the stronger country will dictate the terms . cpec is a small yet very_important part of this project . pakistan needs to critically analyse the projects to get maximum_benefits as per our needs . as our needs may be different from chinese vision , so we should be fully involved in planning_and_execution of cpec_projects

india needs rational foreign_policy to boost its economy india needs rational foreign_policy to boost its economy   by yu ning source : global_times_published : 2020/7/22 20:24:03   indian external_affairs_minister s. jaishankar on monday laid out his views on the power_differential between china and india . the indian minister told a tv_channel that the gap in the development of india and china over the last_three_decades has " implications " for the bilateral_relationship , the india - based deccan chronicle reported .   he said china must be given credit for its impressive growth in the past_few_decades by focusing on economic_growth and sweeping reforms , adding that china 's growth was much_faster_than that of india .   indian media quickly interpreted what the " implications " are for china - india relations . the hindustan_times , in its tuesday editorial , wrote that " india 's recognition of the power_differential is significant , " saying , " economic_growth is key to foreign_policy . fix it . " the newspaper is right to call india to focus on the economy . but how ?   in_this_regard , china 's experience could serve as a reference for india . in 1988 , when the then prime_minister rajiv_gandhi visited china , the sizes of the two economies were roughly the same . why has china leapfrogged since then at a pace that is much_faster_than that of india ?   the reason lies in china 's unswerving insistence on prioritizing economic_development and its continuous_efforts to create a peaceful external environment for its economic missions . diplomacy is mainly aimed_at serving china 's economic_development . even now when the us is taking a whole - of - government approach to crack_down_on china , the mainstream voice in china is still that china should focus on managing its_own things well , keep boosting the economy and further open up to make the country more prosperous .   to create a peaceful , stable regional environment favorable to economic_development , china has followed the policy of friendship and partnership , strengthen good neighborly relations and practical_cooperation with neighboring_countries . it advocates shelving differences and seeking joint development to solve territorial_disputes with relevant countries , and exercises great restraint facing provocations . china 's foreign_policy not only serves its domestic economic_development , but also benefits its neighboring_countries .   but india 's foreign_policy has often been hijacked by the nationalism within its border . we_have_seen shadows of indian nationalist fervor in almost every china - india border flare - up . when the indian government is confronted with thorny challenges at home that are hard to resolve , it tends to divert_public_attention by creating issues with neighboring_countries .   but the approach wo_n't help in solving domestic_problems . the key to solving domestic_problems is economic_growth , which requires a stable external

us ' drops planned pakistan f-16 fighter_jet subsidy ' us ' drops planned pakistan f-16 fighter_jet subsidy '   the eight f-16s and their equipment would cost pakistan over $_700 m   the us will no_longer subsidise the sale of eight f-16 fighter_jets to pakistan , a senior_state_department_official has told_the_bbc .   the decision means that pakistan will have to pay more_than $_700 m ( 480 m ) - two - and - a - half times the original cost - if it wishes to buy the aircraft .   it comes after congress refused to approve funding for the deal .   some us lawmakers had accused pakistan of not_doing_enough to fight militants . india also objected to the sale .   however , pakistan has argued that the jets are needed for anti - terror_operations , and so the us should help with funding the purchase .   people close to the deal say it is highly_unlikely that pakistan will be willing_to_pay the full cost of the fighter_jets , so it seems to be off for_all_practical_purposes .   a spokesman for the pakistan embassy_in_washington , nadeem Hotiana , told_the_bbc that arms_sales were a long process and that he would not comment on the deal 's current_status .   " f-16s provide precision strike_capability to pakistan 's ongoing campaign against militancy , " he said .   " pakistan believes that the threat from terrorist_networks requires continued capacity_building and both governments continue to work_together towards this objective through a range of measures including the sale of these aircraft . "   pakistan is battling several militant_groups at its borders   the senior us_state_department official , who_asked_to_remain_anonymous as he was_not_authorised_to_speak on the matter , says the obama_administration is_still_very_much in favour of selling the fighter_jets to pakistan as it believes it is in the national interest of the united_states .   however , pakistan would have to bear the full cost of the f-16 fighter_jets if it wished to proceed , he said .   the original arrangement had been that pakistan would pay close to $ 270 m , with the us foreign military financing budget paying for the rest .   however , top us lawmakers have expressed_concerns_over the us government 's decision to sell the jets to pakistan , saying they could_be_used against india rather_than for combating_terrorism .   speaking on wednesday , congressman matt salmon   : " india - pakistan tensions remain elevated , and some question whether the f-16s could ultimately be used against india or other regional_powers , rather_than the terrorists as pakistan has asserted .

( ap )   the temple was serving as a school building until sikhs recently won a legal_battle to have the property returned   on thursday , jubilant members of the sikh_community gathered at the temple to worship   quetta : a 200 - year - old_sikh_temple that served_as_a_school_for_muslim girls_for_seven_decades_was_returned to the sikh_community in quetta , enabling_them_to_worship_there_for the first_time_in_73_years , officials said thursday .   the temple stood empty for a year or two when most sikhs left pakistan for neighboring india after the british partitioned the subcontinent into separate nations in 1947 , following two centuries of colonial_rule .   under the government 's guardianship , a school was later set_up in the temple building , which remained functional until recently , when sikhs won a legal_battle to have the property returned , temple custodian govind singh said .   he said sikhs_living in quetta were delighted to get back to their temple .   " this is the best gift for us . we_are_grateful to pakistan and the judiciary for giving it back to us , " local sikh leader Jasbir singh said . " for us , it is like a dream_come_true . "   singh spoke as jubilant members of the sikh_community , adhering_to_social_distancing rules to avoid the spread of the coronavirus , gathered at the temple to worship .   the temple could_not_be returned to the sikhs earlier because of a lingering legal_battle between local sikhs and the provincial_government , singh said . abdullah khilji , an official at the education_department in balochistan , said hundreds of schoolgirls who were studying at the temple building were relocated to a nearby school where they have since adjusted .   the development comes_at_a_time_when pakistan 's tiny hindu_minority is facing_resistance from muslim activists for attempting_to_build a temple in the capital . initially , the government approved its construction , but then reversed the decision after muslims objected .   a council of clerics is currently deliberating whether the temple 's construction should_be_allowed .   however , there_has_been_no other resistance to the construction or renovation of sikh temples in pakistan , where the government of prime_minister_imran_khan has supported the construction of one of the largest sikh shrines to guru_nanak , the
